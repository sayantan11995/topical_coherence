    "1830-1837": "   ha ter I .\nDURING THE YEAR that Lincoln was in the employ of O\ufb00utt,\na series of Indian di\ufb00iculties were in progress in the state.\nBlack Hawk, a celebrated chief of the Sacs, a tribe that by\nthe terms of a treaty entered into near the beginning of the\ncentury, were permanently removed to the western bank of\nthe Mississippi, came down the river with three hundred of\nhis own warriors, and a few allies from the Kickapoos and\nPottawatomies, accompanied also by his women and\nchildren, and crossed to the eastern side with the avowed\nintention of taking possession of the old hunting grounds of\nthe nation on the Rock River. As he was committing\nnumerous \noutrages \non \nthe \nway, \nGeneral \nGaines,\ncommanding the United States forces in that quarter,\nimmediately marched a few companies of regulars to Rock\nIsland, where he took up his position. Governor Reynolds\nseconded his e\ufb00orts by sending to him several hundred\nvolunteers, recruited in the northern and central portions\nof the state. Black Hawk, not being able to meet the force\nthus assembled, retreated, and, on receiving from General\nGaines a threat to cross the river and chastise him on his\nown ground, sued for peace, and rea\ufb00irmed all the terms of\nthe old treaty which con\ufb01ned him to the western shore of\nthe Mississippi.\n The old chief proved treacherous again, and showed in\nthe spring of  that his treaty was simply an expedient\nfor gaining time, and raising a larger force. He gathered his\nwarriors in large numbers, and crossed the river with the\nintention, as he openly declared, of ascending the Rock\nRiver to the territory of the Winnebagoes, among whom he\ndoubtless hoped to receive reinforcements. Warned back by\nGeneral Atkinson, then commanding the United States\ntroops on Rock Island, he returned a de\ufb01ant message, and\nkept on. In this threatening aspect of a\ufb00airs, Governor\nReynolds issued a call for volunteers, and among the\ncompanies that immediately responded was one from\nMenard County. Many of the volunteers were from New\nSalem and Clary\u2019s Grove, and Lincoln, being out of\nbusiness, was the \ufb01rst to enlist. The company being full,\nthey held a meeting at Richland for the election of o\ufb00icers;\nand now the in\ufb02uence of the Clary\u2019s Grove Boys was felt.\nLincoln had completely won their hearts, and they told him\nthat he must be their captain. It was an o\ufb00ice that he did\nnot aspire to, and one for which he felt that he had no\nspecial \ufb01tness; but he consented to be a candidate. There\nwas but one other candidate for the o\ufb00ice, (a Mr.\nKirkpatrick,) and he was one of the most in\ufb02uential men in\nthe county. Previously, Kirkpatrick had been an employer of\nLincoln, and was so overbearing in his treatment of the\nyoung man that the latter left him.\nThe simple mode of electing their captain, adopted by\nthe company, was by placing the candidates apart, and\ntelling the men to go and stand with the one they preferred.\n Lincoln and his competitor took their positions, and then\nthe word was given. At least three out of every four went to\nLincoln at once. When it was seen by those who had ranged\nthemselves with the other candidate that Lincoln was the\nchoice of the majority of the company, they left their places,\none by one, and came over to the successful side, until\nLincoln\u2019s opponent in the friendly strife was left standing\nalmost alone. \u201cI felt badly to see him cut so,\u201d says a witness\nof the scene. Here was an opportunity for revenge. The\nhumble laborer was his employer\u2019s captain, but the\nopportunity was never improved. Mr. Lincoln frequently\nconfessed that no subsequent success of his life had given\nhim half the satisfaction that this election did. He had\nachieved public recognition; and to one so humbly bred the\ndistinction was inexpressibly delightful.\nCaptain Lincoln\u2019s company and several others formed in\nthe vicinity, were ordered to rendezvous at Beardstown, on\nthe Illinois River, and here for the \ufb01rst time he met the\nHon. John T. Stuart, a gentleman who was destined to have\nan important in\ufb02uence upon his life. Stuart was a lawyer by\nprofession, and commanded one of the Sangamon County\ncompanies. Captain Stuart was soon afterwards elected\nMajor of a spy battalion, formed from some of these\ncompanies, and had the best opportunities to observe the\nmerits of Captain Lincoln. He testi\ufb01es that Lincoln was\nexceedingly popular among the soldiers, in consequence of\nhis excellent care of the men in his command, his never-\nfailing good nature, and his ability to tell more stories and\nbetter ones than any man in the service. He was popular\n also among these hardy men on account of his great\nphysical strength. Wrestling was an every-day amusement,\nin which athletic game Lincoln had but one superior in the\narmy. One Thompson was Lincoln\u2019s superior in \u201cscience,\u201d\nand vanquished everybody rather by superior skill than by\nsuperior muscular power.\nOn the th of April, the force at Beardstown moved. A\nfew days of severe marching took the troops to the mouth\nof Rock River. It was there arranged with General Atkinson\nthat they should proceed up the river to Prophetstown,\nwhere they were to await the arrival of the regulars.\nGeneral \nWhiteside, \nin \ncommand \nof \nthe \nvolunteers,\ndisregarding the arrangement for some reason, burnt the\nProphet\u2019s Village, and advanced up the stream forty miles\nfurther, to Dixon\u2019s Ferry. These marches were severe; but\nto men bred as Captain Lincoln had been, they were but\nthe repetition of every-day hardships, under more exciting\nmotives.\nBefore arriving at Dixon\u2019s Ferry, the army halted, and\nleaving behind their baggage-wagons, made a forced march\nupon the place. Arriving there, scouting parties were sent\nout to ascertain the position of the enemy. At this time they\nwere joined by two battalions of mounted volunteers from\nthe region of Peoria, who, having a taste for a little \ufb01ghting\non their own responsibility, had rashly engaged Black\nHawk, and had been chased in disorder from the \ufb01eld of\ntheir boyish adventure, leaving eleven of their number\nbehind them dead. \u2014 an event which has passed into\nhistory with the title of \u201cStillman\u2019s Defeat.\u201d They came to\n General Whiteside panic-stricken, and a council of war was\nimmediately held which resulted in the determination to\nmarch at once to the scene of the disaster. A battle seemed\nimminent, but the wily savages had anticipated the\nmovement, and not one was found. They had pushed\nfarther up the river, and broken up into predatory and\nforaging bands, one of which pounced upon a settlement\nnear Ottowa, murdered \ufb01fteen persons, and carried two\nyoung women away captive.\nGeneral Whiteside, \ufb01nding the enemy escaped, buried\nthe dead of the day before, returned to camp, and was soon\njoined by General Atkinson with his troops and supplies.\nThe twenty-four hundred men thus brought together made\na force su\ufb00iciently large to annihilate Black Hawk\u2019s army, if\nthey could have brought the cunning warrior to a \ufb01ght, but\nthis was impossible. Here a new trouble arose. The troops\nhad volunteered for a limited period, and, as their time had\nnearly expired, and they were surfeited with hardship\nwithout glory, they clamored to be discharged, and\nGovernor Reynolds yielded to their demands. The danger\nstill continuing, he issued another call for volunteers.\nCaptain Lincoln was among those who had not had enough\nof the war. He had volunteered for a purpose, and he did\nnot intend to leave the service until the purpose was\naccomplished. The Governor, in addition to his general call\nfor volunteers, asked for the formation of a volunteer\nregiment from those just discharged. General Whiteside\nhimself immediately re-enlisted as a private, as did also\nCaptain Lincoln. Then followed a whole month of marching\n and maneuvering, without satisfactory results. There was\nsome \ufb01ghting near Galena, and a skirmish at Burr-Oak\nGrove, but there was not enough of excitement and success\nto keep the restless spirits of the volunteers contented, and\nmany of them deserted. Indeed, the force became reduced\nto one-half of its original numbers. Lincoln, however,\nremained true to his obligations, although it was not his\ngood fortune to participate in the engagements which\nbrought the war to a speedy close. The Indians were\novertaken at last by a force under General Henry. The\npursuit had led them to the Wisconsin River, and here the\nIndians were found in full retreat. They were charged upon,\nand driven in great confusion. Sixty-eight Indians were\nkilled, a large number wounded, and at last, just as the\nsavages were crossing the Mississippi, the battle of Bad-Ax\nwas fought, which resulted in the capture of Black Hawk\nhimself, with nearly all his warriors.\nThe Black Hawk war was not a very remarkable a\ufb00air. It\nmade no military reputations, but it was noteworthy in the\nsingle fact that the two simplest, homeliest and truest men\nengaged in it afterward became Presidents of the United\nStates, viz: General (then Colonel) Zachary Taylor, and\nAbraham Lincoln. Mr. Lincoln never spoke of it as anything\nmore than an interesting episode in his life, except upon\none occasion when he used it as an instrument for turning\nthe military pretensions of another into ridicule. The\nfriends of General Cass, when that gentleman was a\ncandidate for the presidency, endeavored to endow him\nwith a military reputation. Mr. Lincoln, at that time a\n representative in Congress, delivered a speech before the\nHouse, which, in its allusions to General Cass, was\nexquisitely sarcastic and irresistibly humorous. \u201cBy the\nway, Mr. Speaker,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln, \u201cdo you know I am a\nmilitary hero? Yes, sir, in the days of the Black Hawk war, I\nfought, bled and came away. Speaking of General Cass\u2019s\ncareer reminds me of my own. I was not at Stillman\u2019s\nDefeat, but I was about as near it as Cass to Hull\u2019s\nsurrender; and like him I saw the place very soon\nafterward. It is quite certain I did not break my sword, for I\nhad none to break; but I bent my musket pretty badly on\none occasion... If General Cass went in advance of me in\npicking whortleberries, I guess I surpassed him in charges\nupon the wild onions. If he saw any ive, \ufb01ghting Indians, it\nwas more than I did, but I had a good many bloody\nstruggles with the mosquitoes; and although I never fainted\nfrom loss of blood, I can truly say I was often very hungry.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln then went on to say that if he should ever turn\ndemocrat, and be taken up as a candidate for the\npresidency by the democratic party, he hoped they would\nnot make fun of him by attempting to make of him a\nmilitary hero. He lived to see himself the candidate of\nanother party, and witnessed a decided disposition on the\npart of his campaign biographers to make a little political\ncapital for him out of his connection with the Black Hawk\nwar \u2014 an attempt which must have appealed to his quick\nsense of the ludicrous, as well as recalled the speech from\nwhich an extract has been quoted.\n The soldiers from Sangamon County arrived home just\nten days before the state election, and Mr. Lincoln was\nimmediately applied to for permission to place his name\namong the candidates for the legislature. He was then but\ntwenty-three years old, had but just emerged from\nobscurity, and had been but a short time a resident of the\ncounty. The application was a great surprise to him. Indeed,\naside from the evidence of personal and neighborhood\nfriendship which it a\ufb00orded him, the surprise could hardly\nhave been a pleasant one, for his political convictions had\nplaced him among those who were in almost a hopeless\nminority. Party feeling ran high between the friends of\nGeneral Jackson and Henry Clay, but the friends of Mr. Clay\nhad little power. Illinois was strongly democratic and for\nmany years remained so. His opponents in the canvass\nwere well known men, and had shown themselves and\nmade their speeches throughout the county; yet in Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s own precinct he was voted for alike by political\nfriend and foe. The o\ufb00icial vote of the New Salem precinct,\nas shown by the poll-book in the clerk\u2019s o\ufb00ice at\nSpring\ufb01eld, was, at this time, for Congress: Jonathan H.\nPugh , Joseph Duncan ; while the vote for Abraham\nLincoln for the legislature was , or one more than the\naggregate for both the candidates for Congress. This vote\nwas undoubtedly the result of the personal popularity\nacquired by Lincoln during his brief military campaign. All\nhis soldiers voted for him, and worked for his election\nwherever they had in\ufb02uence. But he was defeated on the\n general vote, and immediately looked about to \ufb01nd what\nthere was for him to do.\nIt is interesting to recall the fact that at this time he\nseriously took into consideration the project of learning the\nblacksmith\u2019s trade. He was without means, and felt the\nimmediate necessity of undertaking some business that\nwould give him bread. It was while he was entertaining this\nproject that an event occurred which, in his undetermined\nstate of mind, seemed to open a way to success in another\nquarter. A man named Reuben Radford, the keeper of a\nsmall store in the village of New Salem, had somehow\nincurred the displeasure of the Clary\u2019s Grove Boys, who\nhad exercised their \u201cregulating\u201d prerogatives by irregularly\nbreaking in his windows. William G. Greene, a friend of\nyoung Lincoln, riding by Radford\u2019s store soon afterward,\nwas hailed by him, and told that he intended to sell out. Mr.\nGreene went into the store, and, looking around, o\ufb00ered\nhim at random four hundred dollars for his stock. The o\ufb00er\nwas immediately accepted. Lincoln happening in the next\nday, and being familiar with the value of the goods, Mr.\nGreene proposed to him to take an inventory of the stock,\nand see what sort of a bargain he had made. This he did,\nand it was found that the goods were worth six hundred\ndollars. Lincoln then made him an o\ufb00er of a hundred and\ntwenty-\ufb01ve dollars for his bargain, with the proposition that\nhe and a man named Berry, as his partner, should take his\n(Greene\u2019s) place in the notes given to Radford. Mr. Greene\nagreed to the arrangement, but Radford declined it, except\n on condition that Greene would be their security, and this\nhe at last assented to.\nBerry proved to be a dissipated, tri\ufb02ing man, and the\nbusiness soon became a wreck. Mr. Greene was obliged to\ngo in and help Lincoln close it up, and not only do this but\npay Radford\u2019s notes. All that young Lincoln won from the\nstore was some very valuable experience, and the burden\nof a debt to Greene which, in his conversations with the\nlatter, he always spoke of as \u201cthe national debt.\u201d But this\nnational debt, unlike the majority of those which bear the\ntitle, was paid to the utmost farthing in after years. Six\nyears afterwards, Mr. Greene, who knew nothing of the law\nin such cases, and had not troubled himself to inquire about\nit, and who had, in the meantime, removed to Tennessee.\nreceived notice from Mr. Lincoln that he was ready to pay\nhim what he had paid for Berry \u2014 he, Lincoln, being legally\nbound to pay the liabilities of his partner.\nAbout this time Mr. Lincoln was appointed postmaster by\nPresident Jackson. The o\ufb00ice was too insigni\ufb01cant to be\nconsidered politically, and it was given to the young man\nbecause everybody liked him, and because he was the only\nman willing to take it who could make out the returns. He\nwas exceedingly pleased with the appointment, because it\ngave him a chance to read every newspaper that was taken\nin the vicinity. He had never been able to get half the\nnewspapers he wanted before, and the o\ufb00ice gave him the\nprospect of a constant feast. Not wishing to be tied to the\no\ufb00ice, as it yielded him no revenue that would reward him\nfor the con\ufb01nement, he made a post-o\ufb00ice of his hat.\n Whenever he went out, the letters were placed in his hat.\nWhen an anxious looker for a letter found the postmaster,\nhe had found his o\ufb00ice; and the public o\ufb00icer, taking o\ufb00 his\nhat, looked over his mail wherever the public might \ufb01nd\nhim. He kept the o\ufb00ice until it was discontinued, or\nremoved to Petersburgh.\nOne of the most beautiful exhibitions of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nrigid honesty occurred in connection with the settlement of\nhis accounts with the post-o\ufb00ice department, several years\nafterwards. It was after he had become a lawyer, and had\nbeen a legislator. He had passed through a period of great\npoverty, had acquired his education in the law in the midst\nof many perplexities, inconveniences and hardships, and\nhad met with temptations, such as few men could resist, to\nmake a temporary use of any money he might have in his\nhands. One day, seated in the law o\ufb00ice of his partner, the\nagent of the post-o\ufb00ice department entered, and inquired if\nAbraham Lincoln was within. Mr. Lincoln responded to his\nname, and was informed that the agent had called to collect\na balance due the department since the discontinuance of\nthe New Salem o\ufb00ice. A shade of perplexity passed over\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s face, which did not escape the notice of\nfriends who were present. One of them said at once:\n\u201cLincoln, if you are in want of money, let us help you.\u201d He\nmade no reply, but suddenly rose, and pulled out from a\npile of books a little old trunk, and, returning to the table,\nasked the agent how much the amount of his debt was. The\nsum was named, and then Mr. Lincoln opened the trunk,\npulled out a little package of coin wrapped in a cotton rag,\n and counted out the exact sum, amounting to something\nmore than seventeen dollars. After the agent had left the\nroom, he remarked quietly that he never used any man\u2019s\nmoney but his own. Although this sum had been in his\nhands during all these years, he had never regarded it as\navailable, even for any temporary purpose of his own.\nThe store having \u201cwinked out,\u201d to use his own\nexpression, he was ready for something else, and it came\nfrom an unexpected quarter. John Calhoun, a resident of\nSpring\ufb01eld, and since notorious as President of the\nLecompton Constitutional Convention, in Kansas, was the\nsurveyor of Sangamon County. The constant in\ufb02ux of\nimmigrants made his o\ufb00ice a busy one, and, looking around\nfor assistance, he \ufb01xed upon Lincoln, and deputed to him\nall his work in the immediate vicinity of New Salem.\nLincoln had not the slightest knowledge of surveying, and\nbut the slenderest acquaintance with the science upon\nwhich it was based. He would be obliged to \ufb01t himself for\nhis work in the shortest possible time, and he did. Mr.\nCalhoun lent him a copy of Flint and Gibson, and after a\nbrief period of study, he procured a compass and chain (the\nold settlers say that his \ufb01rst chain was a grape-vine,) and\nwent at his work. The work procured bread, and, what\nseemed quite as essential to him, books; for during all\nthese months he was a close student, and a constant\nreader. \nMr. \nLincoln \nsurveyed \nthe \npresent \ntown \nof\nPetersburgh, and much of the adjacent territory. He\npursued this business steadily for a year or more, and with\nsuch success that the accuracy of his surveys has never\n been called in question. One interruption must have\noccurred in his work, though it was brief. His compass and\nchain were attached and sold to pay a debt of Berry\u2019s, for\nwhich he was surety, but they were bought by a man named\nJames Short, who immediately gave them back to him.\n   ha ter  .\nHITHERTO THE LIFE of our subject has run in a single\nstream. His history thus far has related to his private\ncareer \u2014 to his birth, education, growth of mind and\ncharacter, and personal struggles. Before entering upon\nthat period or his life through which we are to trace a\ndouble current, a private and a public one, it will be proper\nto inquire what kind of a man he had become.\nNo man ever lived, probably, who was more a self-made\nman than Abraham Lincoln. Not a circumstance of his life\nfavored the development which he had reached. He was\nself-moved \nto \nstudy \nunder \nthe \nmost \ndiscouraging\nconditions. He had few teachers, few books, and no\nintellectual companions. His father could neither read nor\nwrite. His mother died when he was a child. He had none of\nthose personal attractions which would naturally enlist the\nsympathies and assistance of any re\ufb01ned men and women\nwith whom he must occasionally have come in contact. He\nwas miserably poor, and was compelled to labor among\npoor people to win his daily bread. There was not an\nin\ufb02uence around him except that left upon him by his\n\u201cangel mother,\u201d which did not tend rather to drag him\ndown than lift him up. He was not endowed with a hopeful\ntemperament. He had no force of self-esteem \u2014 no faith in\nhimself that buoyed him up amid the contempt of the proud\n and prosperous. He was altogether a humble man \u2014\nhumble in condition, and humble in spirit. Yet, by the love\nof that which was good and great and true, and by the\nhunger and thirst of a noble nature, he was led to the\nacquisition of a practical education, and to the development\nof all those peculiar powers that were latent within him.\nHe was loyal to his convictions. There is no doubt that at\nthis time he had begun to think of political life. He was, at\nleast, thoroughly conversant with the politics of his own\nstate and of the country. There was not a more diligent\nreader of political newspapers than he. He had become\nfamiliar with the position and history of the politicians and\nstatesmen of the country, and must have been entirely\naware of the unpopularity of those toward whom his\njudgment and sympathies led him. That he was then, and\nalways remained, an ambitious man, there is no question;\nand with this fact in mind we can measure the sacri\ufb01ce\nwhich adherence to his convictions cost him. His early love\nof Henry Clay has already been noticed; and this love for\nthe great Kentuckian, though circumstances modi\ufb01ed it\nsomewhat, never ceased. He clung to him with the warmest\na\ufb00ection through the most of his life, pronounced his\neulogy when he died, and stood \ufb01rmly by the principles\nwhich \nhe \nrepresented. \nIn \na \nstate \noverwhelmingly\ndemocratic, he took his position with the minority, and\nsteadily \nadhered \nto \nthe \nopposition \nagainst \nall \nthe\ntemptations to quick and certain success which desertion\nwould bring him.\n He was a marked and peculiar man. People talked about\nhim. His studious habits, his greed for information, his\nthorough mastery of the di\ufb00iculties of every new position in\nwhich he was placed, his intelligence touching all matters\nof public concern, his unwearying good nature, his skill in\ntelling a story, his great athletic power, his quaint, odd\nways, his uncouth appearance, all tended to bring him into\nsharp contrast with the dull mediocrity by which he was\nsurrounded. Denton O\ufb00utt, his old employer in the store,\nsaid, in the extravagance of his admiration, that he knew\nmore than any other man in the United States. The\nGovernor of Indiana, one of O\ufb00utt\u2019s acquaintances, said,\nafter having a conversation with Lincoln, that the young\nman \u201chad talent enough in him to make a President.\u201d In\nevery circle in which he found himself, whether re\ufb01ned or\ncoarse, he was always the center of attraction. William G.\nGreene says that when he (Greene) was a member of\nIllinois college, he brought home with him, on a vacation,\nRichard Yates, the present Governor of the state, and some\nother boys, and, in order to entertain them, took them all\nup to see Lincoln. He found him in his usual position and at\nhis usual occupation. He was \ufb02at on his back, on a cellar\ndoor, reading a newspaper. That was the manner in which a\nPresident of the United States and a Governor of Illinois\nbecame acquainted with one another. Mr. Greene says that\nLincoln then could repeat the whole of Burns, and was a\ndevoted \nstudent \nof \nShakspeare. \nSo \nthe \nrough\nbackwoodsman, self-educated, entertained the college\nboys, and was invited to dine with them on bread and milk.\n How he managed to upset his bowl of milk is not a matter\nof history, but the fact that he did so is, as is the further\nfact that Greene\u2019s mother, who loved Lincoln, tried to\nsmooth over the accident, and relieve the young man\u2019s\nembarrassment.\nWherever he moved he found men and women to respect\nand love him. One man who knew him at that time says that\n\u201cLincoln had nothing, only plenty of friends.\u201d And these\nfriends trusted him wholly, and were willing to be led by\nhim. His unanimous election as Captain in the Black Hawk\nwar, and the unanimous vote given him for the legislature\nby political friend and foe, wherever in the county he was\nknown, \nillustrates \nhis \nwonderful \npopularity. \nAll \nthe\ncircumstances considered, it was probably without a\nprecedent or parallel. When we remember that this\npopularity was achieved without any direct attempt to win\nit \u2014 that he \ufb02attered nobody, made no pretensions\nwhatever, and was the plainest and poorest man in his\nprecinct, we can appreciate something of the strength of\nhis character and the beauty and purity of his life. He\naroused no jealousies, for he was not sel\ufb01sh. He made no\nenemies, because he felt kindly toward every man. People\nwere glad to see him rise, because it seemed just that he\nshould rise. Indeed, all seemed glad to help him along.\nHe was a man of practical expedients. He always found\nsome way to get out of di\ufb00iculties, whether moral or\nmechanical, and was equally ingenious in his expedients for\nescaping or surmounting each variety. Governor Yates, in a\nspeech at Spring\ufb01eld, before a meeting at which William G.\n Greene presided, quoted Mr. Greene as having said that the\n\ufb01rst time he ever saw Lincoln he was \u201cin the Sangamon\nRiver, with his trousers rolled up \ufb01ve feet more or less,\ntrying to pilot a \ufb02at-boat over a mill-dam. The boat was so\nfull of water that it was hard to manage. Lincoln got the\nprow over, and then, instead of waiting to bail the water\nout, bored a hole through the projecting part, and let it run\nout.\u201d Barring a little western extravagance in the statement\nof a measurement, the incident is truly recorded; and it\nillustrates more forcibly than words can describe the man\u2019s\ningenuity in the quick invention of moral expedients, then\nand afterwards. His life had been a life of expedients. He\nhad always been engaged in making the best of bad\nconditions and untoward circumstances, and in meeting\nand mastering emergencies. Among those who did not\nunderstand him, he had the credit or the discredit, of being\na cunning man; but cunning was not at all an element of his\nnature or character. He was simply ingenious; he was\nwonderfully ingenious; but he was not cunning. Cunning is,\nor tries to be, far-sighted; ingenuity disposes of occasions.\nCunning contrives plots; ingenuity dissolves them. Cunning\nsets traps; ingenuity evades them. Cunning envelops its\nvictims in di\ufb00iculties; ingenuity helps them out of them.\nCunning is the o\ufb00spring of sel\ufb01shness; ingenuity is the\nchild or companion of practical wisdom. He took his boat\nsafely over a great many mill-dams during his life, but\nalways by an expedient.\nHe was a religious man. The fact may be stated without\nany reservation \u2014 with only an explanation. He believed in\n God, and in his personal supervision of the a\ufb00airs of men.\nHe believed himself to be under his control and guidance.\nHe believed in the power and ultimate triumph of the right,\nthrough his belief in God. This unwavering faith in a Divine\nProvidence began at his mother\u2019s knee, and ran like a\nthread of gold through all the inner experiences of his life.\nHis constant sense of human duty was one of the forms by\nwhich his faith manifested itself. His conscience took a\nbroader grasp than the simple apprehension of right and\nwrong. He recognized an immediate relation between God\nand himself, in all the actions and passions of his life. He\nwas not professedly a Christian \u2014 that is, he subscribed to\nno creed, \u2014 joined no organization of Christian disciples.\nHe spoke little then, perhaps less than he did afterward,\nand \nalways \nsparingly, \nof \nhis \nreligious \nbelief \nand\nexperiences; but that he had a deep religious life,\nsometimes imbued with superstition, there is no doubt. We\nguess at a mountain of marble by the outcropping ledges\nthat hide their whiteness among the ferns.\nAt this period of his life he had not exhibited in any form\nthat has been preserved, those logical and reasoning\npowers that so greatly distinguished him during his\nsubsequent public career. The little clubs at and around\nNew Salem where he \u201cpracticed polemics\u201d kept no records,\nand have published no reports. The long talks in O\ufb00utt\u2019s\nstore, on the \ufb02at-boat, on the farm and by the cabin \ufb01reside\nhave not been preserved; but there is no doubt that the\ngerm of the power was within him, and that the peculiarity\nof his education developed it into the remarkable and\n unique faculty which did much to distinguish him among\nthe men of his generation. He had been from a child, in the\nhabit of putting his thoughts into language. He wrote\nmuch, and to this fact is doubtless owing his clearness in\nstatement. He could state with great exactness any fact\nwithin the range of his knowledge. His knowledge was not\ngreat, nor his vocabulary rich, but he could state the details\nof one by the use of the other with a precision that Daniel\nWebster never surpassed.\nHe was a childlike man. No public man of modern days\nhas been fortunate enough to carry into his manhood so\nmuch of the directness, truthfulness and simplicity of\nchildhood as distinguished him. He was exactly what he\nseemed. He was not awkward for a purpose, but because\nhe could not help it. He did not dress shabbily to win votes,\nor excite comment, but partly because he was too poor to\ndress well, and partly because he had no love for dress, or\ntaste in its arrangement. He was not honest because be\nthought honesty was \u201cthe best policy,\u201d but because honesty\nwas with him \u201cthe natural way of living.\u201d With a modest\nestimate of his own powers, and a still humbler one of his\nacquisitions, he never assumed to be more or other than he\nwas. A lie in any form seemed impossible to him. He could\nneither speak one nor act one, and in the light of this fact\nall the words and acts of his life are to be judged.\nIf this brief statement of his qualities and powers\nrepresents a wonderfully perfect character \u2014 so strangely\npure and noble that it seems like the sketch of an\nenthusiast, it is not the writer\u2019s fault. Its materials are\n drawn from the lips of old friends who speak of him with\ntears \u2014 who loved him then as if he were their brother, and\nwho worship his memory with a fond idolatry. It is drawn\nfrom such humble materials as composed his early history.\nHe loved all, was kind to all, was without a vice of appetite\nor passion, was honest, was truthful, was simple, was\nunsel\ufb01sh, was religious, was intelligent and self-helpful,\nwas all that a good man could desire in a son ready to enter\nlife. We shall see how such a man with such a character\nentered life, and passed through it.\n   ha ter  I.\nSEVERAL OF THE old acquaintances of Mr. Lincoln speak of\nhis having studied law, or having begun the study of law,\nprevious to . He had doubtless thought of it, and had\nmade it a subject of consideration among his friends. With\na vague project of doing this at some time, he had bought a\ncopy of Blackstone at an auction in Spring\ufb01eld, and had\nlooked it over. This fact was enough to furnish a basis for\nthe story; but by his own statement he did not begin the\nstudy of his profession until after he had been a member of\nthe legislature.\nTwo years had passed away since his unsuccessful\nattempt to be elected a representative of Sangamon\nCounty. In the meantime, he had become known more\nwidely. His duties as surveyor had brought him into contact\nwith people in other localities. He had become a political\nspeaker, and, although rather rough and slow and\nargumentative, was very popular. He had made a few\nspeeches on the condition that the friends who persuaded\nhim to try the experiment \u201cwould not laugh at him.\u201d They\nagreed to the condition, and found no occasion to depart\nfrom it.\nIn , he became again a candidate for the legislature,\nand was elected by the highest vote cast for any candidate.\nMajor John T. Stuart, whose name has been mentioned as\n an o\ufb00icer in the Black Hawk war, and whose acquaintance\nLincoln made at Beardstown, was also elected. Major\nStuart had already conceived the highest opinion of the\nyoung man, and seeing much of him during the canvass for\nthe election, privately advised him to study law. Stuart was\nhimself engaged in a large and lucrative legal practice at\nSpring\ufb01eld. Lincoln said he was poor \u2014 that he had no\nmoney to buy books, or to live where books might be\nborrowed and used. Major Stuart o\ufb00ered to lend him all he\nneeded, and he decided to take the kind lawyer\u2019s advice,\nand accept his o\ufb00er. At the close of the canvass which\nresulted in his election, he walked to Spring\ufb01eld, borrowed\n\u201ca load\u201d of books of Stuart, and took them home with him\nto New Sale. Here he began the study of law in good\nearnest, though with no preceptor. He studied while he had\nbread, and then started out on a surveying tour, to win the\nmoney that would buy more. One who remembers his\nhabits during this period says that he went, day after day,\nfor weeks, and sat under an oak tree on a hill near New\nSalem and read, moving around to keep in the shade, as the\nsun moved. He was so much absorbed that some people\nthought and said that he was crazy. Not unfrequently he\nmet and passed his best friends without noticing them. The\ntruth was that he had found the pursuit of his life, and had\nbecome very much in earnest.\nDuring Lincoln\u2019s campaign, he possessed and rode a\nhorse, to procure which he had quite likely sold his\ncompass and chain, for, as soon as the canvass had closed,\nhe \nsold \na \nhorse, \nand \nbought \nthese \ninstruments\n indispensable to him in the only pursuit by which he could\nmake his living. When the time for the assembling of the\nlegislature approached, Lincoln dropped his law books,\nshouldered his pack, and, on foot, trudged to Vandalia, then\nthe capital of the state, about a hundred miles, to make his\nentrance into public life.\nHis personal appearance at this time must have been\nsomething of an improvement upon former days. A\ngentleman now living in Chicago, then a resident of Coles\nCounty, met him at that time, or very soon afterwards, and\nsays that he was dressed in plain mixed jeans, his coat\nbeing of the surtout fashion, which, at that day, and in that\npart of the country, was a very reputable dress. He speaks\nof him, also, as being then extremely modest and retiring.\nColonel Jesse K. Dubois, (one of the Sangamon County\ndelegation,) and Lincoln were the two youngest men in the\nHouse. During this session, Mr. Lincoln said very little, but\nlearned much. As he was a novice in legislation, he left the\ntalking to older and wiser men. James Semple, afterwards\nUnited States Senator, was elected speaker, and by him\nLincoln was assigned to the second place on the committee\non public accounts and expenditures. The subject of\ncontrolling interest before the legislature has no special\ninterest in connection with Mr. Lincoln\u2019s life. The state was\nnew, and very imperfectly developed. A plan of internal\nimprovements was in agitation, special reference being had\nto a loan for the bene\ufb01t of the Illinois and Michigan Canal\nCompany, which had been incorporated in . The loan\nbill was not carried at this session, though it was at a\n subsequent one. Lincoln was constantly in his place, and\nfaithful in the performance of all the duties that were\ndevolved upon him. When the session coeed, he walked\nhome as he came, and resumed his law and his surveying.\nThe canvass of , which resulted in his re-election to\nthe legislature, was an unusually exciting one, and resulted\nin the choice of a House which has probably never been\nequaled in any state, in the whole history of the country, for\nits number of remarkable men. As early as June th, of\nthat year, we \ufb01nd a letter in the Sangamon Journal,\naddressed by Mr. Lincoln to the editor, beginning as\nfollows: \u201cIn your paper of last Saturday, I see a\ncommunication over the signature of \u2018Many Voters,\u2019 in\nwhich the candidates who are announced in the Journal,\nare called upon to \u2018show their hands.\u2019 Agreed. Here\u2019s\nmine.\u201d He then goes on in his characteristic way to \u201cshow\nhis hand,\u201d which was that substantially of the new whig\nparty. It was during this canvass that he made the most\nstriking speech he had ever uttered, and one that\nestablished his reputation as a \ufb01rst-class political debater.\nIt has been spoken of, by some writers, as the \ufb01rst speech\nhe ever uttered; but this is a mistake. The opposing\ncandidates had met at Spring\ufb01eld, as is the custom in the\nwestern states, for a public discussion of the questions\ninvolved in the canvass; and a large number of citizens had\ngathered in the Court House to hear the speeches. Ninian\nW. Edwards, then a whig, led o\ufb00, and was followed by Dr.\nEarly, a sharp debater and a representative man among the\ndemocrats. Early bore down very heavily upon Edwards \u2014\n so much so that the latter wanted the opportunity for an\nimmediate rejoinder, but Lincoln took his turn upon the\nplatform. Embarrassed at \ufb01rst, and speaking slowly, he\nbegan to lay down and \ufb01x his propositions. His auditors\nfollowed him with breathless attention, and saw him inclose\nhis adversary in a wall of fact, and then weave over him a\nnetwork of deductions so logically tight in all its meshes,\nthat there was no escape for the victim. He forgot himself\nentirely, as he grew warm at his work. His audience\napplauded, and with ridicule and wit he riddled the man\nwhom he had made helpless. Men who remember the\nspeech allude particularly to the transformation which it\nwrought in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s appearance. The homely man was\nmajestic, \nthe \nplain, \ngood-natured \nface \nwas \nfull \nof\nexpression, the long, bent \ufb01gure was straight as an arrow,\nand the kind and dreamy eyes \ufb02ashed with the \ufb01re of true\ninspiration. His reputation was made, and from that day to\nthe day of his death, he was recognized in Illinois as one of\nthe most powerful orators in the state.\nThe Sangamon County delegation, consisting of nine\nrepresentatives, was so remarkable for the physical altitude\nof its members that they were known as \u201cThe Long Nine.\u201d\nNot a man of the number was less than six feet high, and\nLincoln was the tallest of the nine, as he was the leading\nman intellectually, in and out of the House. Among those\nwho \ncomposed \nthe \nHouse, \nwere \nGeneral \nJohn \nA.\nMcClernand, afterward, a member of Congress, Jesse K.\nDubois, afterwards auditor of the state; James Semple, the\nspeaker of this and the previous House, and subsequently\n United States Senator; Robert Smith, afterwards member\nof Congress; John Hogan, at present a member or Congress\nfrom St. Louis; General James Shields, afterwards United\nStates Senator; John Dement, who has since been treasurer\nof the state; Stephen A. Douglas, whose subsequent public\ncareer is familiar to all; Newton Cloud, president of the\nconvention which framed the present state constitution of\nIllinois; John J. Hardin, who fell at Buena Vista; John Moore,\nafterwards Lieutenant Governor of the state; William A.\nRichardson, subsequently United States Senator, and\nWilliam \nMcMurtny, \nwho \nhas \nsince \nbeen \nLieutenant\nGovernor of the State. This list does not embrace all who\nhad then, or who have since been distinguished, but it is\nlarge enough to show that Lincoln was, during the term of\nthis legislature, thrown into association and often into\nantagonism with the brightest men of the new state. It is\nenough, with this fact in mind, to say that he was by them\nand by the people regarded as one of the leading men in\nthe House.\nThe principal measure with this legislature was the\nadoption of a general system of public improvements. It\nwas a great object with the special friends of this measure\nto secure the co-operation and support of the two senators\nand nine representatives from Sangamon County, but they\n\ufb01rmly refused to support the measure, unless the removal\nof the capital from Vandalia to Spring\ufb01eld was made a part\nof the proposed system. So the measure for this removal\npassed through its various stages in company with the\ninternal improvement bill, and both were enacted on the\n same day. The measure which thus changed the location of\nthe capital of the state to Spring\ufb01eld, brought great\npopularity to the members from Sangamon, at least in their\nown home, and especially to Mr. Lincoln, who was put\nforward on all occasions to do the important work in\nsecuring it. When it is remembered that he had achieved\nhis position before the people and among the leading men\nof the state at the early age of twenty-seven, it must be\nadmitted that the disadvantages under which he had\nlabored had not hindered him from doing what the best\neducated and most favored would have been proud to do.\nIt was at this session that Mr. Lincoln met Stephen A.\nDouglas for the \ufb01rst time. Mr. Douglas was then only\ntwenty-three years old, and was the youngest man in the\nHouse. Mr. Lincoln, in speaking of the fact subsequently,\nsaid that Douglas was then \u201cthe least man he ever saw.\u201d He\nwas not only very short but very slender. The two young\nmen, who commenced their intellectual and political\nsparring during the session, could hardly have foreseen the\nstruggle in which they were to engage in after years \u2014 a\nstruggle which foreshadowed and even laid the basis of an\nepoch in the national history, and in the history of freedom\nand progress throughout the world.\nThis session of the legislature was notable for its\nconnection with the beginning of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s anti-slavery\nhistory. It was at Vandalia, at this time, that Mr. Lincoln and\nMr. Douglas marked out the course in which they were to\nwalk \u2014 one to disappointment and a grave of unsatis\ufb01ed\nhopes and ba\ufb04ed ambitions, the other to the realization of\n his highest dreams of achievement and renown, and a\nmartyrdom that crowns his memory with an undying glory.\nIllinois contained many immigrants from the border slave\nstates. Its territory was joined to two of them; and there\nwas a strong desire to live in harmony with neighbors quick\nto anger and resentment, and sensitive touching their\n\u201cpeculiar institution.\u201d The prevailing sentiment in the state\nwas in favor of slavery, or in favor of slaveholders in the\nexercise of their legal and constitutional rights. There\nwere, in fact, a few hundred slaves living in the state at\nthat time, as appears by the census tables, but by what law\nis not apparent. The democratic party was unanimously\npro-slavery, and whatever there may have been of anti-\nslavery sentiment among the whigs was practically of little\naccount. The abolitionist was hated and despised by both\nparties alike, and the whigs deprecated and disowned the\ntide with indignation. There was doubtless some anti-\nslavery sentiment among the whigs, but it was weak and\ntimid. Both parties were strong in their professed regard\nfor the Constitution, and neither party doubted that the\nConstitution protected the institution of American Slavery.\nThe agitation of the slavery question was just beginning\nto create uneasiness among slaveholders and politicians;\nand during the winter the subject was broached in the\nlegislature. Resolutions were introduced of an extreme pro-\nslavery character, and the attempt was made to \ufb01x the\nstigma of abolitionism upon all who did not indorse them.\nThey were carried through by the large democratic\nmajority, and the opposition to them was weak in numbers\n and weaker still in its positions. We can judge something of\nits weakness when we learn that only two men among all\nthe whig members were found willing to subscribe to a\nprotest against these resolutions. Abraham Lincoln and Dan\nStone, \u201crepresentatives from the County of Sangamon,\u201d\nentered upon the Journal of the House their reasons for\nrefusing to vote for these o\ufb00ensive resolutions, and they\nwere the only men in the state who had the manliness to do\nit. The points of the protest were these: that while \u201cthe\nCongress of the United States has no power under the\nConstitution to interfere with the institution of slavery in\nthe di\ufb00erent states,\u201d and that while \u201cthe promulgation of\nabolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its\nevils,\u201d still, the \u201cinstitution of slavery is founded on both\ninjustice and bad policy,\u201d and Congress \u201chas the power,\nunder the Constitution, to abolish slavery in the District of\nColumbia.\u201d The latter proposition was quali\ufb01ed by the\nstatement that this power \u201cought not to be exercised unless\nat the request of the people of said District.\u201d Certainly this\nprotest was a moderate one, and we may judge by it\nsomething of the character of the resolutions which\ncompelled its utterance. We may judge something also of\nthe low grade of anti-slavery sentiment in the whig party at\nthat time, when only two men could be found to sign so\nmoderate and guarded a document as this. Still, the refusal\nto sign may have been a matter of policy, for which a good\nreason could be given. It was something, however, for two\nmen to stand out, and protest that slavery was a moral and\npolitical evil, over which Congress had power upon the\n national territory. It was the beginning of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s anti-\nslavery record, and modest and moderate as it was, and\nmuch as Mr. Lincoln afterwards accomplished for the\nabolition of slavery, he never became more extreme in his\nviews than the words of this protest indicate. He never\nceased to believe that Congress had no power under the\nConstitution to interfere with slavery in the di\ufb00erent states.\nHe never thought worse of slavery than that it was founded\nin injustice and bad policy. He never changed his belief\ntouching the power of Congress over the institution of\nslavery in territory under the exclusive jurisdiction of the\nUnited States. This little protest, entered into with his\nbrother representative, Dan Stone, was the outline of the\nplatform upon which he stood, and fought out the great\nanti-slavery battle whose trophies were four million\nfreedmen, and a nation redeemed to justice and humanity.\nIn the meantime, Mr. Lincoln had made no money. He\nhad walked his hundred miles to Vandalia in , as he did\nin , and when the session closed he walked home\nagain. A gentleman in Menard County remembers meeting\nhim and a detachment of \u201cThe Long Nine\u201d on their way\nhome. They were all mounted except Lincoln, who had thus\nfar kept up with them on foot. If he had money, he was\nhoarding it for more important purposes than that of saving\nleg-weariness and leather. The weather was raw, and\nLincoln\u2019s clothing was none of the warmest. Complaining of\nbeing cold to one of his companions, this irreverent\nmember of \u201cThe Long Nine\u201d told his future President that it\nwas no wonder he was cold\u2014 \u201cthere was so much of him on\n the ground.\u201d None of the party appreciated this homely\njoke at the expense of his feet (they were doubtless able to\nbear it) more thoroughly than Lincoln himself. We can\nimagine the cross-\ufb01res of wit and humor by which the way\nwas enlivened during this cold and tedious journey. The\nscene was certainly a rude one and seems more like a\ndream than a reality, when we remember that it occurred\nless than thirty years ago, in a state which now contains\nhardly less than a million and a half of people and three\nthousand miles of railway.\n   ha ter  II.\nTHE TIME HAD come with Mr. Lincoln for translation to a\nnew sphere of life. By the scantiest means he had wrested\nfrom the hardest circumstances a development of his\ncharacteristic powers. He had acquired the rudiments of an\nEnglish education. He had read several text books of the\nnatural sciences, with special attention to geology, in the\nfacts and laws of which he had become particularly\nintelligent. He had read law as well as he could without the\nassistance of preceptors. He had attended a few sessions of\nthe courts held near him, and had become somewhat\nfamiliar with the practical application of legal processes.\nHe had, from the most discouraging beginnings, grown to\nbe a notable political debater. He had had experience in\nlegislation, had received public recognition as a man of\nmark and power, had been accepted as one of the leaders\nof an intelligent and morally in\ufb02uential political party, and\nhad fairly outgrown the humble conditions by which his life\nhall hitherto been surrounded.\nAt this time he received from his Spring\ufb01eld friend,\nMajor Stuart, a proposition to become his partner in the\npractice of the law. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s in\ufb02uence in securing the\ntransfer of the capital from Vandalia to Spring\ufb01eld had\nalready given him a favorable introduction to the people of\nthe city; and on the th of April, , he took up his\n abode there. He went to his new home with great self-\ndistrust and with many misgivings concerning his future;\nbut Spring\ufb01eld became his permanent home. He had been\nadmitted to the bar during the autumn of , and went to\nhis work with the ambition to be something, and the\ndetermination to do something.\nIt must have been with something of regret that he\nturned his back upon New Salem, for he left behind him a\ntown full of friends, who had watched his progress with the\nfriendliest interest, aided him when he needed aid, and\nappreciated him. He left behind him all the stepping-stones\nby which he had mounted to the elevation he bad reached\n\u2014 the old store-house where he had been a successful\nclerk, the old store-house where he had been an\nunsuccessful principal, the scenes of his wrestling-matches\nand foot-races, the lounging-places where he had sat and\ntold stories with a post-o\ufb00ice in his hat, the rough\naudience-rooms in which he had \u201cpracticed polemics,\u201d the\nplaces where he had had his rough encounters with the\nClary\u2019s Grove Boys, and, last, the old oak tree whose\nshadow he had followed to keep his law text out of the sun.\nBut these things could have touched him but little when\nplaced by the side of a few cabin homes, presided over by\nnoble women who, with womanly instinct, had detected the\nmanliness of his nature, and had given him a home \u201cfor his\ncompany,\u201d as they kindly said, when he needed one in\ncharity. He never forgot these women, and occasion\nafterward came to show the constancy of his gratitude and\nthe faithfulness of his friendship. Arriving in Spring\ufb01eld he\n became a member of the family of Hon. William Butler,\nafterward treasurer of the state, and here came under\nin\ufb02uences which, to a man bred as he had been, were of\nthe most desirable character.\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s business connection with Mr. Stuart must\nhave been broken and brief, for he was still a member of\nthe legislature, which was summoned to a special session\non the July following his removal to Spring\ufb01eld, and Mr.\nStuart, himself, was soon afterwards elected to, and took\nhis seat in, Congress. Still, the connection was one of\nadvantage to the young lawyer. Mr. Stuart\u2019s willingness to\nreceive him as a partner was an indorsement of his powers\nand acquisitions that must have helped him to make a start\nin professional life. This life the people of Spring\ufb01eld, who\ngratefully remembered his services to them in the\nlegislature, would not permit him to pursue without\ninterruption. They kept him upon the legislative ticket in\n, and he was re-elected. On the assembling of this\nlegislature, Mr. Lincoln was at once recognized to be the\nforemost man on the whig side of the house, and was\nbrought forward, without any dissent, as their candidate for\nspeaker. The strength of this legislature was pretty evenly\ndivided between the two parties. A great change, indeed,\nhad occurred in the state. The \ufb01nancial crash of  had\nprostrated industry and trade, and the people had, either\njustly or unjustly, held the dominant party responsible for\nthe disasters from which they had su\ufb00ered. Anti-slavery\nagitation had been voted down in Congress by the friends\nof Mr. Van Buren, who came into the presidential o\ufb00ice\n during the previous year. All papers relating to slavery\nwere, by solemn resolution of Congress, laid on the table\nwithout being debated, read, printed or referred. With\n\ufb01nancial ruin in the country, and a gag-law in Congress, the\ndemocratic party had a heavier load than it could carry.\nThis was felt in Illinois, where the old democratic majority\nwas very nearly destroyed. Colonel W.L.D. Ewing was the\ncandidate of the democrats for speaker, in opposition to Mr.\nLincoln, and was at last elected by a majority of one vote.\nMr. Lincoln took a prominent part in all the debates of the\nsession. Some of them were political, and were intended to\nhave a bearing upon the next presidential election, and\nespecially upon the politics of the state; but the most of\nthem related to local and ephemeral a\ufb00airs which will be of\nno interest to the general reader.\nAllusion has already been made to Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\ningenuity \u2014 his quickness, at expedients. One of his modes\nof \ngetting \nrid \nof \ntroublesome \nfriends, \nas \nwell \nas\ntroublesome enemies, was by telling a story. He began\nthese tactics early in life, and he grew to be wonderfully\nadept in them. If a man broached a subject which he did\nnot wish to discuss, he told a story which changed the\ndirection of the conversation. If he was called upon to\nanswer a question, he answered it by telling a story. He had\na story for everything \u2014 something had occurred at some\nplace where he used to live, that illustrated every possible\nphase of every possible subject with which he might have\nconnection. His faculty of \ufb01nding or making a story to\nmatch every event in his history, and every event to which\n he bore any relation, was really marvelous. That he made,\nor adapted, some of his stories, there is no question. It is\nbeyond belief that those which entered his mind left it no\nricher than they came. It is not to be supposed that he\nspent any time in elaborating them, but by some law of\nassociation every event that occurred suggested some\nstory, and, almost by an involuntary process, his mind\nharmonized their discordant points, and the story was\npronounced \u201cpat,\u201d because it was made so before it was\nuttered. Every truth, or combination of truths, seemed\nimmediately to clothe itself in a form of life, where he kept\nit for reference. His mind was full of stories; and the great\nfacts of his life and history on entering his mind seemed to\ntake up their abode in these stories, and if the garment did\nnot \ufb01t them it was so modi\ufb01ed that it did.\nA good instance of the execution which he sometimes\ne\ufb00ected with a story occurred in the legislature. There was\na troublesome member from Wabash County, who gloried\nparticularly in being a \u201cstrict constructionist.\u201d He found\nsomething \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in every measure that was\nbrought forward for discussion. He was a member of the\nJudiciary Committee, and was quite apt, after giving every\nmeasure a heavy pounding, to advocate its reference to this\ncommittee. No amount of sober argument could \ufb02oor the\nmember from Wabash. At last, he came to be considered a\nman to be silenced, and Mr. Lincoln was resorted to for an\nexpedient by which this object might be accomplished. He\nsoon afterwards honored the draft thus made upon him. A\nmeasure was brought forward in which Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\n constituents were interested, when the member from\nWabash rose and discharged all his batteries upon its\nunconstitutional points. Mr. Lincoln then took the \ufb02oor,\nand, with the quizzical expression of features which he\ncould assume at will, and a mirthful twinkle in his gray\neyes, said: \u201cMr. Speaker, the attack of the member from\nWabash on the constitutionality of this measure reminds me\nof an old friend of mine. He\u2019s a peculiar looking old fellow,\nwith shaggy, overhanging eyebrows, and a pair of\nspectacles under them. (Everybody turned to the member\nfrom Wabash, and recognized a personal description.) One\nmorning just after the old man got up, he imagined, on\nlooking out of his door, that he saw rather a lively squirrel\non a tree near his house. So he took down his ri\ufb02e, and\n\ufb01red at the squirrel, but the squirrel paid no attention to\nthe shot. He loaded and \ufb01red again, and again, until, at the\nthirteenth shot, he set down his gun impatiently, and said to\nhis boy, who was looking on, \u2018Boy, there\u2019s something wrong\nabout this ri\ufb02e.\u2019 \u2018Ri\ufb02e\u2019s all right, I know \u2019tis,\u2019 responded the\nboy, \u2018but where\u2019s your squirrel?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you see him,\nhumped up about half way up the tree?\u2019 inquired the old\nman, peering over his spectacles, and getting mysti\ufb01ed.\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t,\u2019 responded the boy; an then turning and\nlooking into his father\u2019s face, he exclaimed, \u2018I see your\nsquirrel! You\u2019ve been \ufb01ring at a louse on your eyebrow!\u2019\u201d\nThe story needed neither application nor explanation.\nThe House was in convulsions of laughter; for Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nskill in telling a story was not inferior to his appreciation of\nits points and his power of adapting them to the case in\n hand. It killed o\ufb00 the member from Wabash, who was very\ncareful afterwards not to provoke any allusion to his\n\u201ceyebrows.\u201d\nA man who practiced law in Illinois in the earlier years of\nthe state \u201crode the circuit,\u201d a proceeding of which the older\ncommunities of the East know nothing. The state of Illinois,\nfor instance, is divided into a number of districts, each\ncomposed of a number of counties, of which a single judge,\nappointed or elected, as the case may be, for that purpose,\nmakes the circuit, holding courts at each county seat.\nRailroads being scarce, the earlier circuit judges made\ntheir trips from county to county on horseback, or in a gig;\nand, as lawyers were not located in each county, all the\nprominent lawyers living within the limits of the circuit\nmade the tour of the circuit with the judge. After the\nbusiness of one county was \ufb01nished, the judge and all the\nlawyers mounted their horses or their gigs and pushed on\nto the next county-seat, and so repeated the process until\nthe whole circuit was compassed; and this is what is known\nin the western states as \u201criding the circuit.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln rode the circuit; and it was upon these long\nand tedious trips that he established his reputation as one\nof the best lawyers in Illinois, and, in some respects, the\nsuperior of any lawyer in the state. It is doubtful whether\nhe was ever regarded by his professional brethren as a\nwell-read lawyer. Toward the latter part of his life, he had,\nby his own powers of generalization and deduction, become\nversed ia the principles of law, and was coming to be\nrecognized by the best lawyers as their peer; but his\n education was too defective at the \ufb01rst to make him\nanything better than what is called \u201ca case lawyer.\u201d He\nstudied his cases with great thoroughness, and was so\nuniformly successful in them that the people regarded him\nas having no equal. He had been engaged in practice but a\nshort time when he was found habitually on one side or the\nother of every important case in the Circuit. The writer\nremembers an instance in which many years ago, before he\nhad risen to political eminence, he was pointed out to a\nstranger, by a citizen of Spring\ufb01eld, as \u201cAbe Lincoln, the\n\ufb01rst lawyer of Illinois.\u201d He certainly enjoyed great\nreputation among the people.\nMr. Lincoln was a very weak lawyer when engaged by\nthe weak side. This side he never took, if, by careful\ninvestigation of the case, he could avoid it. If a man went to\nhim with the proposal to institute a suit, he examined\ncarefully the man\u2019s grounds for the action. If these were\ngood, he entered upon the case, and prosecuted it faithfully\nto the end. If the grounds were not good he would have\nnothing to do with the case. He invariably advised the\napplicant to dismiss the matter, telling him frankly that he\nhad no case, and ought not to prosecute. Sometimes he was\ndeceived. Sometimes he discovered, in the middle of a trial,\nby the revelation of a witness, that his client had lied to\nhim. After the moment that he was convinced that justice\nwas opposed to him and his client, he lost all his\nenthusiasm and all his courage. Indeed, he lost all interest\nin the case. His e\ufb00orts for his client after that moment\nwere simply mechanical, for he would not lie for any man,\n or strive to make the worse appear the better reason for\nany man. He had a genuine interest in the establishment of\njustice between man and man. As a citizen, as a lover of\ngood order, as a man who believed in truth and justice, he\nwas, by every instinct of his nature, opposed to the success\nof villainy and the triumph of wrong, and he would not sell\nhimself to purposes of injustice and immorality. He\nrepeatedly refused to take fees on the wrong side of a case.\nWhen his clients had practiced gross deception upon him,\nhe forsook their cases in mid-passage; and he always\nrefused to accept fees of those whom he advised not to\nprosecute. On one occasion, while engaged upon an\nimportant case, he discovered that he was on the wrong\nside. His associate in the case was immediately informed\nthat he (Lincoln) would not make the plea. The associate\nmade it, and the case, much to the surprise of Lincoln, was\ndecided for his client. Perfectly convinced that his client\nwas wrong, he would not receive one cent of the fee of nine\nhundred dollars which he paid. It is not wonderful that one\nwho knew him well spoke of him as \u201cperversely honest.\u201d\nThis \u201criding the circuit\u201d was, in those early days, a\npeculiar business, and tended to develop peculiar traits of\ncharacter. The long passages from court-house to court-\nhouse, the stopping at cabins by the way to eat, or sleep, or\nfeed the horse, the evenings at the country taverns, the\nexpedients resorted to to secure amusement, the petty,\nmean and shameful cases that abounded, must have tended\nto make it a strange business, and not altogether a pleasant\none. These long passages while riding the circuit were\n seasons of re\ufb02ection with Mr. Lincoln. An amusing incident\noccurred in connection with one of these journeys, which\ngives a pleasant glimpse into the good lawyer\u2019s heart. He\nwas riding by a deep slough, in which, to his exceeding\npain, he saw a pig struggling, and with such faint e\ufb00orts\nthat it was evident that he could not extricate himself from\nthe mud. Mr. Lincoln looked at the pig and the mud which\nenveloped him, and then looked at some new clothes with\nwhich he had but a short time before enveloped himself.\nDeciding against the claims of the pig, he rode on, but he\ncould not get rid of the vision of the poor brute, and, at last,\nafter riding two miles, he turned back, determined to\nrescue the animal at the expense of his new clothes.\nArrived at the spot, he tied his horse, and coolly went to\nwork to build of old rails a passage to the bottom of the\nhole. Descending on these rails, he seized the pig and\ndragged him out, but not without serious damage to the\nclothes he wore. Washing his hands in the nearest brook,\nand wiping them on the grass, he mounted his gig and rode\nalong. He then fell to examining the motive that sent him\nback to the release of the pig. At the \ufb01rst thought, it\nseemed to be pure benevolence, but, at length, he came to\nthe conclusion that it was sel\ufb01shness, for he certainly went\nto the pig\u2019s relief in order (as he said to the friend to whom\nhe related the incident,) to \u201ctake a pain out of his own\nmind.\u201d This is certainly a new view of the nature of\nsympathy, and one which it will be well for the casuist to\nexamine.\n While Mr. Lincoln was not regarded by his professional\nassociates as profoundly versed in the principles of law, he\nwas looked upon by them as a very remarkable advocate.\nNo man in Illinois had such power before a jury as he. This\nwas a fact universally admitted. The elements of his power\nas an advocate were perfect lucidity of statement, great\nfairness in the treatment of both sides of a case, and the\nskill to conduct a common mind along the chain of his logic\nto his own conclusion. In presenting a case to a jury, he\ninvariably presented both sides of it. After he had done this,\nthere was really little more to be said, for he could state the\npoints of his opponent better generally than his opponent\ncould state them for himself. The man who followed him\nusually found himself handling that which Mr. Lincoln had\nalready reduced to cha\ufb00. There was really no trick about\nthis. In the \ufb01rst place he would not take a case in which he\ndid not believe he was on the side of justice. Believing that\nthe right was with him, he felt that he could a\ufb00ord to give\nto the opposing counsel everything that he could claim, and\nstill have material enough left for carrying his verdicts. His\nfairness was not only apparent but real, and the juries he\naddressed knew it to be so. He would stand before a jury\nand yield point after point that nearly every other lawyer\nwould dispute under the same circumstances, so that,\nsometimes, his clients trembled with apprehension; and\nthen, after he had given his opponent all he claimed, and\nmore than he had dared to claim, he would state his own\nside of the case with such power and clearness that that\nwhich had seemed strong against him was reduced to\n weakness, that which had seemed to be sound was proved\nto be specious, and that which had the appearance of being\nconclusive against him was plainly seen to be corroborative\nof his own positions on the question to be decided. Every\njuror was made to feel that Mr. Lincoln was an absolute aid\nto him in arriving at an intelligent and impartial verdict.\nThe cunning lawyers thought that Mr. Lincoln was very\ncunning in all this \u2014 thought that his fairness was only\napparent and assumed for a purpose \u2014 but it has already\nbeen stated that cunning was not an element of his nature.\nHe had no interest in the establishment of anything but\njustice, and injustice, even if it favored him, could give him\nno satisfaction. The testimony of the lawyers who were\nobliged to try cases with him is that he was \u201ca hard man to\nmeet.\u201d\nComing from the people, and being perfectly familiar\nwith the modes of thought and mental capacity of the men\nwho generally composed his juries, he knew all their\ndi\ufb00iculties, knew just what language to address to them,\nwhat illustrations to use, and how to bring his arguments to\nbear upon their minds. This point is well illustrated by the\ndetails of a case in the Coles Circuit Court.\nThe controversy was about a colt, in which thirty-four\nwitnesses swore that they had known the colt from its\nfalling, and that it was the property of the plainti\ufb00; while\nthirty swore that they had known the colt from its falling,\nand that it was the property of the defendant. It may be\nstated, at starting, that these witnesses were all honest,\nand that the mistake grew out of the exact resemblances\n which two colts bore to each other. One circumstance was\nproven by all the witnesses, or nearly all of them, viz: that\nthe two claimants of the colt agreed to meet on a certain\nday with the two mares which were respectively claimed to\nbe the dams of the colt, and permit the colt to decide which\nof the two he belonged to. The meeting occurred according\nto agreement, and, as it was a singular case and excited a\ngood deal of popular interest, there were probably a\nhundred men assembled on their horses and mares, from\nfar and near. Now the colt really belonged to the defendant\nin the case. It had strayed away and fallen into company\nwith the plainti\ufb00\u2019s horses. The plainti\ufb00\u2019s colt had, at the\nsame time, strayed away and had not returned, and was not\nto be found. The moment the two mares were brought upon\nthe ground, the defendant\u2019s mare and the colt gave signs of\nrecognition. The colt went to its dam, and would not leave\nher. They fondled each other; and, although the plainti\ufb00\nbrought his mare between them, and tried in various ways\nto divert the colt\u2019s attention, the colt would not be\nseparated from its dam. It then followed her home, a\ndistance of eight or ten miles, and, when within a mile or\ntwo of the stables, took a short cut to them in advance of its\ndam. The plainti\ufb00 had sued to recover the colt thus gone\nback to its owner.\nIn the presentation of this case to the jury, there were\nthirty-four witnesses on the side of the plainti\ufb00; while the\ndefendant had, on his side, only thirty witnesses; but he\nhad on his side the colt itself and its dam \u2014 thirty-four men\nagainst thirty men and two brutes. Here was a case that\n was to be decided by the preponderance of evidence. All\nthe witnesses were equally positive, and equally credible.\nMr. Lincoln was on the side of the defendant, and\ncontended that the voice of nature in the mare and colt\nought to outweigh the testimony of a hundred men. The\njury were all farmers, and all illiterate men, and he took\ngreat pains to make them understand what was meant by\nthe \u201cpreponderance of evidence.\u201d He said that in a civil\nsuit, absolute certainty, or such certainty as would be\nrequired to convict a man of crime, was not essential. They\nmust decide the case according to the impression which the\nevidence had produced upon their minds, and, if they felt\npuzzled at all, he would give them a test by which they\ncould bring themselves to a just conclusion. \u201cNow,\u201d said he,\n\u201cif you were going to bet on this case, on which side would\nyou be willing to risk a picayune? That side on which you\nwould be willing to bet a picayune, is the side on which\nrests the preponderance of evidence in your minds. It is\npossible that you may not be right, but that is not the\nquestion. The question is as to where the preponderance of\nevidence lies, and you can judge exactly where it lies in\nyour minds, by deciding as to which side you would be\nwilling to bet on.\u201d\nThe jury understood this. There was no mysti\ufb01cation\nabout it. They had got hold of a test by which they could\nrender an intelligent verdict. Mr. Lincoln saw into their\nminds, and knew exactly what they needed; and the\nmoment they received it, he knew that his case was safe, as\na quick verdict for the defendant proved it to be. In nothing\n connected with this case was the ingenuity of Mr. Lincoln\nmore evident, perhaps, than in the insigni\ufb01cance of the\nsum which he placed in risk by the hypothetical wager. It\nwas not a hundred dollars, or a thousand dollars, or even a\ndollar, but the smallest silver coin, to show to them that the\nverdict should go with the preponderance of evidence, even\nif the preponderance should be only a hair\u2019s weight.\nIf it was the habit of Mr. Lincoln to present both sides of\nhis cases to the jury, it was, of course, his habit to study\nboth sides with equal thoroughness. He was called slow in\narriving at the points of a case. It is probably true that his\nmind was not one of the quickest in the processes of\ninvestigation. He certainly exercised great care in coming\nto his conclusions. It was then, in the days of his legal\npractice, his habit to argue against himself, and it always\nremained the habit of his life. He took special interest in\nthe investigation of every point that could be made against\nhim and his positions. This habit made his processes of\ninvestigation slower than those of other men, while the\nlimited range of his legal education rendered it necessary\nthat he should bestow more study upon his cases than\nbetter educated lawyers found it necessary to bestow.\nOne of the most even-tempered men that ever lived, Mr.\nLincoln was the subject of great varieties of mood, and\nextremes of feeling. His constitution embraced remarkable\ncontradictions. Oppressed with a deep melancholy at times,\nweighed down by the great problems of his own life and of\nhumanity at large, assuming and carrying patiently the\nmost important public burdens, he was as simple as a boy,\n took delight in the most trivial things, and with the subtlest\nand quickest sense of the ludicrous, laughed incontinently\nover incidents and stories that would hardly move any\nother man in his position to a smile. At one time, while\nriding the circuit with a friend, he entered into an\nexposition of his feelings touching what seemed to him the\ngrowing corruption of the world, in politics and morals. \u201cOh\nhow hard it is,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cto die, and not to be able to\nleave the world any better for one\u2019s little life in it!\u201d Here\nwas a key to one cause of his depression, and an index to\nhis aspirations. After this conversation and the ride were\nover, he probably arrived at a country tavern, and there\nspent the evening in telling stories to his brother lawyers,\nand in laughing over the most tri\ufb02ing incidents.\nIt will perhaps be as well, at this point of his history as\nelsewhere, to allude to his habit of telling stories that it\nwould not be proper to repeat in the presence of women. It\nis useless for Mr. Lincoln\u2019s biographers to ignore this habit,\nfor it was notorious. The whole West, if not the whole\ncountry, is full of these stories; and there is no doubt at all\nthat he indulged in them with the same freedom that he did\nin those of a less exceptionable character. Good people are\nat a loss to account for this apparent love of impurity, in a\nman of such exalted aims, such deep truthfulness, such\nhigh aspirations. The matter is easily explained.\nThose who have heard these stories will readily admit\nthat they are the wittiest and most amusing of their kind,\nand, when they have admitted that, they have in their\nminds the only reason of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s indulgence in them.\n It was always the elements of wit and humor that\ncaptivated him. He was not an impure man in his life, or in\nhis imaginations. For impurity\u2019s sake, he never uttered an\nimpure word, or made an impure allusion, but, whenever\nhe found anything humorous, ludicrous or witty, he could\nnot resist the inclination to use it, whatever the incidents\nmight be with which it was associated. Anything that was\nmorally beautiful touched him to tears. He was equally\nsensitive to all that was heroic, beautiful, grand, sweet,\nludicrous and grotesque in human life. He wept as readily\nover a tale of heroic self-devotion, as he laughed over a\nhumorous story.\nIt is also to be said that the habit of telling these\nexceptionable stories was the habit of his profession, in his\nregion of country, at the time he was engaged in practice\nthere. He indulged in them no more than his brother\nlawyers, and he excelled them in his stories no more than\nhe did in everything else. It is to be said, further, that there\nis something in the practice of the law that makes these\nstories more tolerable in the legal profession, even when\nthe members of it are Christian men \u2014 men of pure morals\nand pure instincts \u2014 than in any other profession in the\nworld. The legal profession brings men into constant\nassociation with impurity, with the details or cases of\nshame, with all the smut and dirt that can be raked from\nthe haunts of vice, with all the particulars of prurient\ndalliance and bestial licentiousness. With this habitual \u2014\nthis professional \u2014 familiarity with impurity, it is not\nstrange that the sense of propriety in language becomes\n deadened; and none know better than lawyers that there is\nin their profession, in the older parts of the country as well\nas in the newer, great laxity of speech, touching subjects\nwhich they would blush to introduce \u2014 which would cost\nthem their self-respect and the respect of the community to\nintroduce \u2014 among women. Mr. Lincoln was not a sinner in\nthis thing above other men, equally pure and good in his\nprofession. It is not a habit to be justi\ufb01ed in any man. It is\nnot a habit to be tolerated in any man who indulges in it to\ngratify simply his love of that which is beastly. In Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s case, it is a habit to be explained and regretted.\nHis whole life had been spent with people without\nre\ufb01nement. His legal study and practice had rendered this\nclass of subjects familiar. It was the habit of his\nprofessional brethren to tell these objectionable stories,\nand, even if his pure sensibilities sometimes rebelled \u2014 for\nhe possessed and always maintained the profoundest\nrespect for women \u2014 the wit and humor they contained\novertempted him.\nOne of the most beautiful traits of Mr. Lincoln was his\nconsiderate regard for the poor and obscure relatives he\nhad left, plodding along in their humble way of life.\nWherever upon his circuit he found them, he always went\nto their dwellings, ate with them, and, when convenient,\nmade their houses his home. He never assumed in their\npresence the slightest superiority to them, in the facts and\nconditions of his life. He gave them money when they\nneeded and he possessed it. Countless times he was known\nto leave his companions at the village hotel, after a hard\n day\u2019s work in the court room, and spend the evening with\nthese old friends and companions of his humbler days. On\none occasion, when urged not to go, he replied, \u201cWhy,\naunt\u2019s heart would be broken if I should leave town without\ncalling upon her;\u201d yet he was obliged to walk several miles\nto make the call.\nA little fact in this connection will illustrate his ever-\npresent desire to deal honestly and justly with men. He had\nalways a partner in his professional life, and, when he went\nout upon the circuit, this partner was usually at home.\nWhile out, he frequently took up and disposed of cases that\nwere never entered at the o\ufb00ice. In these cases, after\nreceiving his fees, he divided the money in his pocket book,\nlabeling each sum (wrapped in a piece of paper,) that\nbelonged to his partner, stating his name, and the case on\nwhich it was received. He could not be content to keep an\naccount. He divided the money, so that if he, by any\ncasualty, should fail of an opportunity to pay it over, there\ncould be no dispute as to the exact amount that was his\npartner\u2019s due. This may seem trivial, nay, boyish, but it was\nlike Mr. Lincoln. But we must set aside the professional\nman for a while, to notice other a\ufb00airs which mingled in his\nlife.\n",
    "1838-1845": "   ha ter  III.\nTHE \u201cSANGAMON CHIEF,\u201d as Mr. Lincoln had been\npopularly named, was placed upon the legislative ticket\nagain in , and re-elected. At a special session of the\nprevious legislature, held during , Vandalia as the\ncapital of the state had been forsaken, and Spring\ufb01eld\nreceived the legislature and the archives and o\ufb00ices of the\nstate government. Mr. Lincoln was in the legislature, and,\nat the same time, at home. The fact reconciled him to\nholding an o\ufb00ice which he felt to be a disadvantage to his\nbusiness, for he could attend upon his duties at the State\nHouse, and, at the same time, have a care that his\nprofessional interests were not entirely sacri\ufb01ced. In the\nonly session held by the legislature of , no important\nbusiness \nof \ngeneral \ninterest \nwas \ntransacted. \nThe\ndemocratic preponderance in the state had been partially\nrestored and was still maintained, and although Mr. Lincoln\nwas again the \ufb01rst man on the whig side and the candidate\nfor speaker, for which o\ufb00ice he was supported by more\nthan the strength of his party, he was defeated as he had\nbeen in . This session \ufb01nished up Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nconnection with the legislature of the state, for, athough\nurged \nby \nthe \npeople \nto \nrepresent \nthem \nagain,\nconsiderations of a private nature made him peremptory in\nhis refusal to be again a candidate. It is recorded, however,\n that he was re-elected in , and that he resigned before\ntaking his seat. The election was made against his will, for\na larger political life was already dawning upon him.\nIt was about this time that a strange incident in his\nprivate life occurred \u2014 one, certainly, which was quite in\ndiscord with his principles and feelings. A sharp, sarcastic\npoem appeared in the Sangamon Journal, edited at that\ntime by Simeon Francis. The poem had an evident allusion\nto James Shields, a young lawyer of Spring\ufb01eld, and since a\nUnited States Senator from Illinois. General Shields was at\nthat time hot-blooded and impulsive, and, instead of\nlaughing o\ufb00 the matter, regarded it seriously, and\ndemanded of Mr. Francis the author\u2019s name. Mr. Francis\nknew at once what the demand meant, and sought to delay\nhis answer. He asked the young man for a day to consider\nwhether he should reveal the name of his contributor or\nnot. The request was granted, when Mr. Francis went to\nwork to ascertain how he could lift the responsibility of the\npublication from his own shoulders, as the writer of the\npoem was a lady. On inquiry among the lady\u2019s friends, he\nascertained that Mr. Lincoln was, at least, one of her\nadmirers, and that he possibly bore a tenderer relation to\nher. Accordingly he went to Mr. Lincoln, and told him that\nhe was in trouble, and explained to him the cause of his\ndi\ufb00iculty. It seemed certain that somebody would be\nobliged to \ufb01ght a duel with Mr. Shields, or be branded by\nhim as a coward; and Mr. Francis, though entirely\nresponsible for the publication of a lady\u2019s poem shrank, in a\nvery unworthy way, from the alternative.\n As soon as Mr. Lincoln comprehended the case, and saw\nwhat Mr. Francis expected of him, he told the editor that if\nMr. Shields should call again, and demand the author\u2019s\nname, to inform him that he, Lincoln, held himself\nresponsible for the poem. The result was just what was\nexpected, at least by Mr. Francis. Mr. Lincoln at once\nreceived a challenge and accepted it. There must have\nexisted in that part of the country, at that time, a state of\nfeeling on this subject which cannot now be comprehended\namong the people of the North. With a natural aversion to\nall violence and bloodshed, with a moral sense that shrank\nfrom the barbaric arbitrament of the duel, with his whole\nsoul at war with the policy which seeks to heal a wound of\nhonor by the commission of a crime, he walked with his\neyes wide open into this duel. It is possible that he\nimagined Mr. Shields did not mean a duel by his question,\nor that he would not \ufb01ght a duel with him; but he certainly\nknew that he made himself liable to a challenge, and\nintended to accept it if it came. Gallantry was, of course,\nthe moving power. The lady\u2019s name was to be protected,\nand the editor who had been imprudent enough to publish\nher poem relieved from all responsibility on her account.\nMr. Lincoln selected broad-swords as the weapons for\nthe encounter, and immediately took instruction in the\nexercise of that arm, of Dr. E.H. Merriman, a physician of\nSpring\ufb01eld. The place of meeting was Bloody Island, a\ndisputed or neutral territory on the Mississippi River, lying\nbetween Illinois and Missouri. The meeting took place\naccording \nto \nappointment, \nbut \nfriends \ninterfered,\n determined that on such foolish grounds no duel should be\nfought, and no blood shed. The parties were brought\ntogether, and a reconciliation easily e\ufb00ected. Mr. Lincoln\nfelt afterwards that he could have done, under the\ncircumstances, no less than he did. He stated to a friend,\nhowever, that he selected broad-swords because his arms\nwere long. He had not the slightest intention of injuring Mr.\nShields, and thought that the length of his arms would aid\nhim in defending his own person.\nThis incident does not seem to have been remembered\nagainst Mr. Lincoln, by any class of the community in which\nhe lived. It was certainly a boyish a\ufb00air, and was probably\nregarded and forgotten as such. Even the excitements of a\ngreat political campaign, like that which resulted in his\nelection to the presidency, did not call it from its slumbers,\nand the American people were spared a representation of\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s atrocities as a duelist.\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s law partnership with Mr. Stuart was\ndissolved in , when he immediately formed a business\nassociation with Judge S.T. Logan of Spring\ufb01eld, one of the\nablest and most learned lawyers in the state. He entered\nupon this new partnership with a determination to devote\nhis time more exclusively to business than he had done, but\nthe people would not permit him to do so. He was called\nupon from all quarters to engage in the exciting political\ncanvass of , and made many speeches.\nIn , having arrived at his thirty-third year, Mr.\nLincoln married Miss Mary Todd, a daughter of Hon.\nRobert S. Todd of Lexington, Kentucky. The marriage took\n place in Spring\ufb01eld, where the lady had for several years\nresided, on the fourth of November of the year mentioned.\nIt is probable that he married as early as the circumstances\nof his life permitted, for he had always loved the society of\nwomen, and possessed a nature that took profound delight\nin intimate female companionship. A letter written on the\neighteenth of May following his marriage, to J.F. Speed,\nEsq., of Louisville, Kentucky, an early and a life-long\npersonal friend, gives a pleasant glimpse of his domestic\narrangements at this time. \u201cWe are not keeping house,\u201d Mr.\nLincoln says in this letter, \u201cbut boarding at the Globe\nTavern, which is very well kept now by a widow lady of the\nname of Beck. Our rooms are the same Dr. Wallace\noccupied there, and boarding only costs four dollars a\nweek... I most heartily wish you and your Fanny will not fail\nto come. Just let us know the time, a week in advance, and\nwe will have a room prepared for you, and we\u2019ll all be\nmerry together for a while.\u201d He seems to have been in\nexcellent spirits, and to have been very hearty in the\nenjoyment of his new relation.\nThe private letters of Mr. Lincoln were charmingly\nnatural and sincere, and there can be no harm in giving a\npassage from one written during these early years, as an\nillustration. Mr. Lincoln has been charged with having no\nstrong personal attachments; but no one can read his\nprivate letters, written at any time during his life, without\nperceiving that his personal friendships were the sweetest\nsources of his happiness. To a particular friend, he wrote\nFebruary th, : \u201cYours of the sixteenth, announcing\n that Miss \u2014\u2014 and you \u2018are no longer twain but one \ufb02esh,\u2019\nreached me this morning. I have no way of telling you how\nmuch happiness I wish you both, though I believe you both\ncan conceive it. I feel somewhat jealous of both of you now,\nfor you will be so exclusively concerned for one another\nthat I shall be forgotten entirely. My acquaintance with\nMiss \u2014\u2014 (I call her thus lest you should think I am\nspeaking of your mother,) was too short for me to\nreasonably hope to long be remembered by her; and still I\nam sure I shall not forget her soon. Try if you cannot\nremind her of that debt she owes me, and be sure you do\nnot interfere to prevent her paying it.\n\u201cI regret to learn that you have resolved not to return to\nIllinois. I shall be very lonesome without you. How\nmiserably things seem to be arranged in this world! If we\nhave no friends we have no pleasure; and if we have them,\nwe are sure to lose them, and be doubly pained by the loss.\nI did hope she and you would make your home here, yet I\nown I have no right to insist. You owe obligations to her ten\nthousand times more sacred than any you can owe to\nothers, and in that light let them be respected and\nobserved. It is natural that she should desire to remain with\nher relations and friends. As to friends, she could not need\nthem anywhere; \u2014 she would have them in abundance\nhere. Give my kind regards to Mr. \u2014\u2014 and his family,\nparticularly to Miss E. Also to your mother, brothers and\nsisters. Ask little E. D \u2014 if she will ride to town with me if I\ncome there again. And, \ufb01nally, give \u2014\u2014 a double\n reciprocation of all the love she sent me. Write me often,\nand believe me, yours forever, LINCOLN.\u201d\nThe \nkind \nfeeling, \nthe \ndelicate \nplayfulness, \nthe\nconsiderate remembrance of all who were associated with\nthe recipient of the missive, and the hearty, outspoken\na\ufb00ection which this letter breathes, reveal a sound and true\nheart in the writer. It is true, indeed, that Mr. Lincoln had a\nfriendly feeling toward everybody; and it is just as true that\nhis personal friendships were as devoted and unsel\ufb01sh as\nthose of a man of more exclusive feelings and more\nabounding prejudices.\nMr. Lincoln seems to have been thinking about a seat in\nCongress at this time. On the th of March, , he\nwrote to his friend Speed: \u201cWe had a meeting of the whigs\nof the county here on last Monday, to appoint delegates to a\ndistrict convention, and Baker beat me, and got the\ndelegation instructed to go for him. The meeting, in spite of\nmy attempt to decline it, appointed me one of the\ndelegates, so that, in getting Baker the nomination, I shall\nbe \u2018\ufb01xed\u2019 a good deal like a fellow who is made groomsman\nto the man who has \u2018cut him out,\u2019 and is marrying his own\ndear gal.\u201d\nIn a subsequent letter, he writes: \u201cIn regard to the\nCongress matter here, you were right in supposing I would\nsupport the nominee. Neither Baker nor myself however,\nwill be the man, but Hardin.\u201d\nIt was Mr. Lincoln\u2019s rule and habit to \u201csupport the\nnominee.\u201d He was always a loyal party man. In the ordinary\nuse of the word, Mr. Lincoln was not, and never became, a\n reformer. He believed that a man, in order to e\ufb00ect\nanything, should work through organizations of men. In a\neulogy upon Henry Clay which he delivered in , occurs\nthe following passage: \u201cA free people, in times of peace and\nquiet, when pressed by no common danger, naturally divide\ninto parties. At such times, the man who is not of either\nparty, is not, cannot be, of any consequence. Mr. Clay,\ntherefore, was of a party.\u201d Whether his position was sound\nor otherwise, he believed it was, and always acted upon it.\nWith as true a love of freedom and progress as any man \u2014\nwith a regard for popular rights never surpassed by\nprofessional reformers \u2014 he was careful to go no faster,\nand no farther, than he could take his party with him, and\nno faster and no farther than was consistent with that\nparty\u2019s permanent success. He would endanger nothing by\nprecipitancy. His policy was to advance surely, even if he\nwas \nobliged \nto \nproceed \nslowly. \nThe \npolicy \nwhich\ndistinguished his presidential career was the policy of his\nlife. It was adopted early, and he always followed it.\nWith Mr. Lincoln\u2019s modest estimate of his own services,\nand with his friendly feelings toward all, it is not to be\nwondered at that he never made much money. It was not\npossible for him to regard his clients simply in the light of\nbusiness. An unfortunate man was a subject of his\nsympathy, no matter what his business relations to him\nmight be. A Mr. Cogdal, who related the incident to the\nwriter, met with a \ufb01nancial wreck in . He employed\nMr. Lincoln as his lawyer, and at the close of the business,\ngave him a note to cover the regular lawyer\u2019s fees. He was\n soon afterwards blown up by an accidental discharge of\npowder, and lost his hand. Meeting Mr. Lincoln some time\nafter the accident, on the steps of the State House, the kind\nlawyer asked him how he was getting along. \u201cBadly\nenough,\u201d replied Mr. Cogdal, \u201cI am both broken up in\nbusiness, and crippled.\u201d Then he added, \u201cI have been\nthinking about that note of yours.\u201d Mr. Lincoln, who had\nprobably known all about Mr. Cogdal\u2019s troubles, and had\nprepared himself for the meeting, took out his pocket-book,\nand saying with a laugh, \u201cwell, you needn\u2019t think any more\nabout it,\u201d handed him the note. Mr. Cogdal protesting, Mr.\nLincoln said \u201cif you had the money, I would not take it,\u201d and\nhurried away. At this same date, he was frankly writing\nabout his poverty to his friends. as a reason for not making\nthem a visit, and probably found it no easy task to take care\nof his family, even when board at the Globe Tavern was\n\u201conly four dollars a week.\u201d\nIn the active discharge of the duties or his profession, in\nthe enjoyments of his new domestic life, and in the\nintrigues of local politics, as betrayed in his letter to Mr.\nSpeed, the months passed away, and brought Mr. Lincoln to\nthe great political contest of . Henry Clay, his political\nidol was the candidate of the whig party for the presidency,\nand he went into the canvass with his whole heart. As a\ncandidate for presidential elector, he canvassed the state of\nIllinois, and afterwards went over into Indiana, and made a\nseries of speeches there. The result of this great campaign\nto \nMr. \nClay \nand \nto \nthe \nwhig \nparty \nwas \na \nsad\ndisappointment. Probably no defeat of a great party ever\n brought to its members so much personal sorrow as this.\nMr. Clay had the power of exciting an enthusiastic a\ufb00ection\nfor his person that few political men have enjoyed. The\nwomen of the country were as much interested in his\nelection as their brothers and husbands were, and wept at\nhis defeat as if he had been their best and most intimate\nfriend. Mr. Lincoln was among the heartiest of these\nmourners; but, while the event rendered his great political\nexemplar a hopeless man politically, the canvass itself had\nraised Mr. Lincoln to the proudest hight he had occupied.\nHe had greatly strengthened the whig organization in the\nstate, and had established his reputation as one of the most\npowerful political debaters in the country. His exposition of\nthe protective system of duties, which was the principal\nissue of the canvass, was elaborate and powerful. He had\nthoroughly mastered his subject, and his arguments are\nstill remembered for the copiousness of their facts, and the\ncloseness and soundness of their logic.\nMr. Clay\u2019s defeat was the more a matter or sorrow with\nMr. Lincoln because it was, in a measure, unexpected. No\npersonal defeat could have been more dispiriting to him\nthan this failure before the people of his political idol. He\nwas not only disappointed but disgusted. With his strong\nconvictions of the soundness of the principles of the whig\nparty, and his belief in the almost immeasurable superiority\nof Mr. Clay over Mr. Polk, he doubtless had the same\nmisgivings that have come to others, touching the capacity\nof the people for self-government, and realized the same\ndistrust of the value of honors which could be so unworthily\n bestowed. It was to him a popular decision in the cause of\npolitical iniquity and bad government. It was not strange,\ntherefore, in the \ufb01rst gush of his disappointment, that he\nmade a new resolution to let politics alone, and attend\nmore devotedly to the duties of his profession. But Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s ambition, and Mr. Lincoln\u2019s friends, more\npowerful than his ambition, were not likely to permit this\nresolution to have a permanent in\ufb02uence upon his career.\nSubsequently, Mr. Lincoln paid a personal visit to Mr.\nClay, and it is possible that he needed the in\ufb02uence of this\nvisit to restore a healthy tone to his feelings, and to teach\nhim that the person whom his imagination had transformed\ninto a demigod was only a man, possessing the full measure\nof weaknesses common to men. In , Mr. Lincoln\nlearned that Mr. Clay had agreed to deliver a speech at\nLexington, Kentucky, in favor of gradual emancipation. He\nhad never seen the great Kentuckian, and this event\nseemed to give him an excuse for breaking away from his\nbusiness, and satisfying his curiosity to look his demigod in\nthe face, and hear the music of his eloquence. He\naccordingly went to Lexington, and arrived there in time to\nattend the meeting.\nOn returning to his home from this visit, he did not\nattempt to disguise his disappointment. The speech itself\nwas written and read. It lacked entirely the spontaneity and\n\ufb01re which Mr. Lincoln had anticipated, and was not\neloquent at all. At the close of the meeting Mr. Lincoln\nsecured an introduction to the great orator, and as Mr. Clay\nknew what a friend to him Mr. Lincoln had been, he invited\n his admirer and partisan to Ashland. No invitation could\nhave delighted Mr. Lincoln more, but the result of his\nprivate interview with Mr. Clay was no more satisfactory\nthan that which followed the speech. Those who have\nknown both men, will not wonder at this, for two men could\nhardly be more unlike in their motives and manners than\nthe two thus brought together. One was a proud man; the\nother was a humble man. One was princely in his bearing;\nthe other was lowly. One was distant and digni\ufb01ed; the\nother was as simple and teachable as a child. One received\nthe deference of men as his due; the other received it with\nan uncomfortable sense of his unworthiness.\nA friend of Mr. Lincoln, who had a long conversation with\nhim after his return from Ashland, found that his old\nenthusiasm was gone. Mr. Lincoln said that though Mr. Clay\nwas most polished in his manners, and very hospitable, he\nbetrayed a consciousness of superiority that none could\nmistake. He felt that Mr. Clay did not regard him, or any\nother person in his presence, as, in any sense, on an\nequality with him. In short, he thought that Mr. Clay was\noverbearing and domineering, and that, while he was\napparently kind, it was in that magni\ufb01cent and patronizing\nway which made a sensitive man uncomfortable.\nIt is quite possible that Mr. Lincoln needed to experience\nthis disappointment, and to be taught this lesson. It was,\nperhaps, the only instance in his life in which he had given\nhis whole heart to a man without knowing him, or been\ncarried away by his imagination into an unbounded zeal on\nbehalf of a personal stranger. It made him more cautious in\n the bestowal of his love. He was, certainly, from that time\nforward, more careful to look on all sides of a man, and on\nall sides of a subject, before yielding to either his devotion,\nthan ever before. If he became slow in moving, it was\nbecause he saw more than his own side of every case and\nquestion, and recognized, in advance, such obstacles as\nwould be certain to impede his progress.\nMuch has been said of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s kindness, and many\nsuppose that he was not brave \u2014 that his patient and\nuniversal love of men was inconsistent with those sterner\nqualities which are necessary to make, not only a true hero,\nbut a true man. An incident occurred during the Clay\ncampaign which shows how ill-founded this estimate of Mr.\nLincoln is. On the occasion of a great mass convention at\nSpring\ufb01eld, U.F. Linder, Esq., now a resident of Chicago,\nand a man of rare eloquence, made a speech which seemed\nto rouse the enthusiasm of the assemblage to the highest\npitch. The speech was very o\ufb00ensive to some of the\ndemocrats who were present \u2014 who, indeed, proposed to\nmake a personal matter of it. Mr. Linder being called out\nagain, in the course of the meeting, was considered in\npersonal danger, if he should attempt to respond. At this\njuncture, Mr. Lincoln and Colonel Baker took their places\nby his side, and, when he \ufb01nished, conducted him to his\nhotel. The ru\ufb00ians knew both men, and prudently refrained\nfrom interfering with them. On a previous occasion, Mr.\nLincoln had protected the person of Colonel Baker himself.\nBaker was speaking in a court-house, which had once been\na store-house, and, on making some remarks that were\n o\ufb00ensive to certain political rowdies in the crowd, they\ncried: \u201ctake him o\ufb00 the stand.\u201d Immediate confusion\nensued, and there was an attempt to carry the demand into\nexecution. Directly over the speaker\u2019s head was an old\nscuttle, at which it appeared Mr. Lincoln had been listening\nto the speech. In an instant, Mr. Lincoln\u2019s feet came\nthrough the scuttle, followed by his tall and sinewy frame,\nand he was standing by Colonel Baker\u2019s side. He raised his\nhand, and the assembly subsided immediately into silence.\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln, \u201clet us not disgrace the age\nand country in which live. This is a land where freedom of\nspeech is guaranteed. Mr. Baker has a right to speak, and\nought to be permitted to do so. I am here to protect him,\nand no man shall take him from this stand if I can prevent\nit.\u201d The suddenness of his appearance, his perfect calmness\nand fairness, and the knowledge that he would do what he\nhad promised to do, quieted all disturbance, and the\nspeaker concluded his remarks without di\ufb00iculty.\nMr. Lincoln has already been spoken of as a strong party\nman, and his thorough devotion to his party, on some\noccasions, \nthough \nvery \nrarely, \nled \nhim \ninto \nhasty\nexpressions and hasty actions, quite out of harmony with\nhis usual self-poise and good nature. A scene occurred in\nthe room occupied by Mr. Lincoln and his particular friend,\nJudge Davis, at Paris, on one occasion, which illustrates\nthis. There was present, as a visitor, a young lawyer of the\nname of Constable, a gentleman of \ufb01ne abilities, and at\npresent a judge of the circuit court. Mr. Constable was a\nwhig, but had probably been disappointed in some of his\n political aspirations, and did not feel that the party had\ntreated him fairly. He was in the habit of speaking\ndisparagingly of the policy of the party in the treatment of\nits own friends, and particularly of its young men,\nespecially when he found whig leaders to listen to him. On\nthis occasion he charged the party with being \u201cold fogyish,\u201d\nand indi\ufb00erent to rising men, while the democratic party\nwas lauded for the contrast which it presented in this\nparticular. Mr. Lincoln felt the charge as keenly as if it had\nbeen a personal one. Indeed, his own experience disproved\nthe whole statement. Constable went on, and charged the\nwhig party with ingratitude and neglect in his own case.\nMr. Lincoln stood with his coat o\ufb00, shaving himself before\nhis glass. He had heard the charges without saying a word,\nbut when Mr. Constable alluded to himself as having been\nbadly treated, he turned \ufb01ercely upon him, and said, \u201cMr.\nConstable, I understand you perfectly, and have noticed for\nsome time back that you have been slowly and cautiously\npicking your way over to the democratic party.\u201d Both men\nwere angry, and it required the e\ufb00orts of all the others\npresent to keep them from \ufb01ghting. Mr. Lincoln seemed for\na time, as one of the spectators of the scene remarks, to be\n\u201cterribly willing.\u201d Such instances as this have been very\nrare in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s life, and the fact that he was\nsusceptible to the in\ufb02uence of such motives renders his\nnotorious equanimity of temper all the more creditable to\nhim. The matter was adjusted between him and Mr.\nConstable, and, not long afterwards, the latter justi\ufb01ed Mr.\n Lincoln\u2019s interpretation of his motives, and was numbered\namong the democrats.\n   ha ter  I.\nTHE LEGITIMATE FRUIT of the Kansas-Nebraska bill had\nalready begun to manifest itself in Kansas. Emigrants from\nthe eastern states and from the north-west began to pour\ninto the territory; and those who had intended that it\nshould become a slave state saw that their scheme was in\ndanger. Mr. Douglas may not have cared whether slavery\nwas \u201cvoted up or voted down\u201d in Kansas, but slaveholders\nthemselves showed a strong preference for voting it up,\nand not only for voting it up, but of backing up their votes\nby any requisite amount of violence. An organization in\nPlatte County, Missouri, declared its readiness, when called\nupon by the citizens of Kansas, to assist in removing any\nand all emigrants who go there under the auspices of any\nof the \u201cEmigrant Aid Societies;\u201d which societies, by the\nway, were supposed to be organizations operating in the\nfree state interest. This was in July, , the Kansas-\nNebraska bill having been passed during the previous May.\nOne B.F. Stringfellow was the secretary of the organization,\nand a fortnight later he introduced, at a meeting of the\nsociety, resolutions declaring in favor of extending slavery\ninto Kansas. Almon H. Reeder was appointed Governor, and\narrived in the territory during the following October. At two\nelections, held within the succeeding six months, the polls\nwere entirely controlled by ru\ufb00ians from the Missouri side\n of \nthe \nborder, \nand \nthose \ndisturbances \nwere \nfully\ninaugurated which illustrated the desperate desire of\nslavery to extend its territory and its power, the hypocrisy\nof Mr. Douglas and his friends in the declaration that the\npeople of the territory should be perfectly free to choose\nand form their institutions, and the shameful subserviency\nof the government at Washington to the interests of the\nbarbarous institution.\nThis much of the history of Kansas, in order to a perfect\nappreciation of a private letter of Mr. Lincoln to his\nKentucky friend, Mr. Speed:\nSpring\ufb01eld, August , .\n\u201cDear Speed: \u2014 You know what a poor correspondent I am.\nEver since I received your very agreeable letter of the\ntwenty-second of May, I have been intending to write you in\nanswer to it. You suggest that in political action now, you\nand I would di\ufb00er. You know I dislike slavery, and you fully\nadmit the abstract wrong of it. So far, there is no cause of\ndi\ufb00erence. But you say that sooner than yield your legal\nright to the slave, especially at the bidding of those who are\nnot themselves interested, you would see the Union\ndissolved. I am not aware that any one is bidding you yield\nthat right \u2014 very certainly I am not. I leave that matter\nentirely to yourself. I also acknowledge your rights and my\nobligations under the Constitution, in regard to your slaves.\nI confess I hate to see the poor creatures hunted down, and\ncaught and carried back to their stripes and unrequited\ntoil; but I bite my lip, and keep quiet. In , you and I\nhad together a tedious, low-water trip on a steamboat from\n Louisville to St. Louis. You may remember, as I well do, that\nfrom Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio, there were on\nboard ten or a dozen slaves, shackled together with irons.\nThat sight was a continual torment to me, and I see\nsomething like it every time I touch the Ohio, or any other\nslave border. It is not fair for you to assume that I have no\ninterest in a thing which has, and continually exercises, the\npower of making me miserable. You ought rather to\nappreciate how much the great body of the people of the\nNorth do crucify their feelings, in order to maintain their\nloyalty to the Constitution and the Union.\n\u201cI do oppose the extension of slavery, because my judgment\nand feelings so prompt me; and I am under no obligations\nto the contrary. It, for this, you and I must di\ufb00er, di\ufb00er we\nmust. You say if you were President you would send an\narmy, and hang the leaders of the Missouri outrages upon\nthe Kansas elections; still, if Kansas fairly votes herself a\nslave state, she must be admitted, or the Union must be\ndissolved. But how if she votes herself a slave state unfairly\n\u2014 that is, by the very means for which you would hang\nmen? Must she still be admitted, or the Union dissolved?\nThat will be the phase of the question when it \ufb01rst becomes\na practical one.\n\u201cIn your assumption that there may be a fair decision on\nthe slavery question in Kansas, I plainly see you and I\nwould di\ufb00er about the Nebraska law. I look upon that\nenactment not as a law, but as a violence, from the\nbeginning. It was conceived in violence, passed in violence,\n is maintained in violence, and is being executed in violence.\nI say it was conceived in violence, because the destruction\nof the Missouri Compromise under the Constitution was\nnothing less than violence. It was passed in violence,\nbecause it could not have passed at all but for the votes of\nmany members in violent disregard of the known will of\ntheir constituents. It is maintained in violence, because the\nelections since clearly demand its repeal, and the demand\nis openly disregarded.\n\u201cYou say men ought to be hung for the way they are\nexecuting that law; and I say the way it is being executed is\nquite as good as any of its antecedents. It is being executed\nin the precise way which was intended from the \ufb01rst, else,\nwhy does no Nebraska man express astonishment or\ncondemnation? Poor Reeder has been the only man who\nhas been silly enough to believe that anything like fairness\nwas ever intended, and he has been bravely undeceived.\n\u201cThat Kansas will form a slave constitution, and with it, will\nask to be admitted into the Union, I take to be an already\nsettled question, and so settled by the very means you so\npointedly condemn. By every principle of law ever held by\nany court, North or South, every negro taken to Kansas is\nfree; and in utter disregard of this \u2014 in the spirit of\nviolence merely \u2014 that beautiful legislature gravely passes\na law to hang men who shall venture to inform a negro of\nhis legal rights. This is the substance and real object of the\nlaw. If, like Haman, they should hang upon the gallows of\n their own building, I shall not be among the mourners for\ntheir fate.\n\u201cIn my humble sphere, I shall advocate the restoration of\nthe Missouri Compromise so long as Kansas remains a\nterritory; and when, by all these foul means it seeks to\ncome into the Union as a slave state, I shall oppose it. I am\nvery loth, in any case, to withhold my assent to the\nenjoyment of property acquired or located in good faith;\nbut I do not admit that good faith in taking a negro to\nKansas, to be held in slavery, is a possibility with any man.\nAny man who has sense enough to be the controller of his\nown property, has too much sense to misunderstand the\noutrageous character of the whole Nebraska business.\n\u201cBut I digress. In my opposition to the admission of Kansas,\nI shall have some company; but we may be beaten. If we\nare, I shall not, on that account, attempt to dissolve the\nUnion. I think it probable, however, that we shall be beaten.\nStanding as a unit among yourselves, you can, directly, and\nindirectly, bribe enough of our men to carry the day \u2014 as\nyou could on an open proposition to establish monarchy.\nGet hold of some man in the North whose position and\nability are such that he can make the support of your\nmeasure \u2014 whatever it may be \u2014 a democratic party\nnecessity, and the thing is done.\n\u201cApropos of this, let me tell you an anecdote. Douglas\nintroduced the Nebraska bill in January. In February,\nafterwards, there was a called session of the Illinois\n legislature. Of the one hundred members comprising the\ntwo branches of that body, about seventy were democrats.\nThe latter held a caucus in which the Nebraska bill was\ntalked of, if not formally discussed. It was thereby\ndiscovered that just three, and no more, were in favor of\nthe measure. In a day or two, Douglas\u2019 orders came on to\nhave resolutions passed, approving the bill, and they were\npassed by large majorities!!! The truth of this is vouched\nfor by a bolting democratic member. The masses, too,\ndemocratic as well as whig, were even more unanimous\nagainst it, but as soon as the party necessity of supporting\nit became apparent, the way the democracy began to see\nthe wisdom and justice of it was perfectly astonishing.\n\u201cYou say if Kansas fairly votes herself a free state, as a\nChristian you will rather rejoice at it. All decent\nslaveholders talk that way, and I do not doubt their candor.\nBut they never vote that way. Although, in a private letter\nor conversation you will express your preference that\nKansas shall be free, you would vote for no man for\nCongress who would say the same thing publicly. No such\nman could be elected, from any district, or any slave state.\nYou think Stringfellow \n Co. ought to be hung; and yet you\nwill vote for the exact type and representation of\nStringfellow. The slave-breeders and slave-traders are a\nsmall and detested class among you, and yet in politics they\ndictate the course of all or you, and are as completely your\nmasters as you are the masters of your own negroes.\n \u201cYou inquire where I now stand. That is a disputed point. I\nthink I am a whig: but others say there are no whigs, and\nthat I am an abolitionist. When I was in Washington, I voted\nfor the Wilmot Proviso as good as forty times, and I never\nheard of any attempt to unwhig me for that. I now do no\nmore than oppose the extension of slavery. I am not a\nKnow-Nothing \u2014 that is certain. How could I be? How can\nany one who abhors the oppression of the negroes be in\nfavor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in\ndegeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation,\nwe began by declaring that \u2018all men are created equal.\u2019 We\nnow practically read it \u2018all men are created equal except\nnegroes.\u2019 When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read,\n\u2018all men are created equal except negroes and foreigners\nand Catholics.\u2019 When it comes to that, I should prefer\nemigrating to some country where they make no pretense\nof loving liberty \u2014 to Russia for instance, where despotism\ncan be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.\n\u201cYour friend forever,\n\u201cA. Lincoln.\u201d\nThis letter, written with perfect freedom to an old\npersonal friend attached to the interests of slavery in a\nslave state, gives with wonderful clearness the state of the\nslavery question at the time, and Mr. Lincoln\u2019s own views\nand feelings. Events justi\ufb01ed the writer\u2019s judgment, and\nveri\ufb01ed his predictions. Mr. Lincoln still considered himself\na whig. The name was one he loved, and the old party\nassociations were very precious to him. But he was passing\nthrough the weaning process, and was realizing more and\n more, with the passage of every month, that there could no\nresuscitation of the dead or dying organization. The\ninterests of slavery had severed from it forever that portion\nthat had made it a powerful national party. It could not\nextend itself an inch south of Mason\u2019s and Dixon\u2019s line. The\nslavery question was the great question. Opposition to the\nextension and encroachments of slavery was sectional, and\nany party which exercised this opposition, however broad\nits views might be, was necessarily sectional. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nlogical mind soon discovered this, and accordingly we \ufb01nd\nhim, \nMay \nth, \n, \nattending \na \nconvention \nat\nBloomington, of those who were opposed to the democratic\nparty. Here, and with Mr. Lincoln\u2019s powerful assistance, the\nrepublican party of Illinois was organized, a platform\nadopted, a state ticket nominated, and delegates were\nappointed to the National Republican Convention in\nPhiladelphia, which was to be held on the seventeenth of\nthe following month.\nThere is no doubt that, from the date of this meeting, he\nfelt himself more a free man in politics than ever before.\nHis hatred of slavery had been constantly growing, and\nnow he was the member of a party whose avowed purpose\nit was to resist the extension of slavery, and to shut it up in\nthe territory where it held its only rights under the\nConstitution. The speech which he made on this occasion\nwas one of distinguished power and eloquence. Mr.\nScripps, in the little sketch of his life to which an allusion\nhas already been made in this volume, says: \u201cNever was an\naudience more competely electri\ufb01ed by human eloquence.\n Again and again during the progress of its delivery, they\nsprang to their feet and upon the benches, and testi\ufb01ed by\nlong continued shouts and the waving of hats, how deeply\nthe speaker had wrought upon their minds and hearts. It\nfused the mass of hitherto incongruous elements into\nperfect homogeneity, and from that day to the present they\nhave worked together in harmonious and fraternal Union.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln was now regarded, not only by the\nrepublicans of Illinois, but by all the western states, as\ntheir \ufb01rst man. Accordingly they presented his name to the\nnational convention as their candidate for the vice-\npresidency. On the informal ballot, he received one hundred\nand ten votes to two hundred and \ufb01fty-nine for Mr. Dayton.\nThis, of course, decided the matter against him, but the\nvote was a complimentary one, and was Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nformal introduction to the nation. Mr. Lincoln labored with\nhis accustomed zeal during the campaign for Fremont and\nDayton, the republican nominees, and had the pleasure, at\nthe end of the canvass, of \ufb01nding the state revolutionized.\nColonel William H. Bissell, the opposition candidate for\nGovernor, was elected by a notable majority, although there\nwere men enough who were not aware that the whig party\nwas dead to give the electoral vote to Mr. Buchanan,\nthrough their support of Mr. Fillmore.\nA little incident occurred during the campaign that\nillustrated Mr. Lincoln\u2019s readiness in turning a political\npoint. He was making a speech at Charleston, Coles\nCounty, when a voice called out, \u201cMr. Lincoln, is it true that\nyou entered this state barefoot, driving a yoke of oxen?\u201d\n Mr. Lincoln paused for full half a minute, as if considering\nwhether he should notice such cruel impertinence, and\nthen said that he thought he could prove the fact by at least\na dozen men in the crowd, any one of whom was more\nrespectable than his questioner. But the question seemed to\ninspire him, and he went on to show what free institutions\nhad done for himself; and to exhibit the evils of slavery to\nthe white man wherever it existed, and asked if it was not\nnatural that he should hate slavery, and agitate against it.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cwe will speak for freedom and against\nslavery, as long as the Constitution of our country\nguarantees free speech, until everywhere on this wide land,\nthe sun shall shine and the rain shall fall and the wind shall\nblow upon no man who goes forth to unrequited toil.\u201d\nFrom this time to the close of his life, he was almost\nentirely absorbed by political a\ufb00airs. He still took charge of\nimportant cases in court, and practiced his profession at\nintervals; but he was regarded as a political man, and had\nmany responsibilities thrown upon him by the new\norganization. \nDuring \nthe \nsummer \nsucceeding \nthe\npresidential canvass, and after Mr. Buchanan had taken his\nseat, Mr. Douglas was invited by the grand jury of the\nUnited States District Court for Southern Illinois, to deliver\na speech at Spring\ufb01eld when the court was in session. In\nthat speech, the senator showed the progress he had made\nin his departure from the doctrines of the fathers, by\nannouncing that the framers of the Declaration of\nIndependence, when they asserted that \u201call men are\ncreated equal,\u201d only meant to say that \u201cBritish subjects on\n this continent were equal to British subjects born and\nresiding in Great Britain.\u201d Mr. Lincoln was invited by a\nlarge number of citizens to reply to this speech, and did so.\nAfter showing in his own quiet and ingenious way the\nabsurdity of this assumption of Judge Douglas, telling his\nauditors that, as they were preparing to celebrate the\nFourth of July, and would read the Declaration, he would\nlike to have them read it in Judge Douglas\u2019 way, viz: \u201cWe\nhold these truths to be self-evident, that all British subjects\nwho were on this continent eighty-one years ago, were\ncreated equal to all British subjects born and then residing\nin Great Britain,\u201d \u2014 he said: \u201cAnd now I appeal to all \u2014 to\ndemocrats as well as others: are you really willing that the\nDeclaration shall thus be frittered away? \u2014 thus left no\nmore, at most, than an interesting memorial of the dead\npast? \u2014 thus shorn of its vitality and its practical value, and\nleft without the germ or even the suggestion of the\ninalienable rights of man in it?\u201d Then Mr. Lincoln added his\nopinion as to what the authors of the Declaration intended;\nand it has probably never been stated with a more catholic\nspirit, or in choicer terms:\n\u201cI think the authors of that notable instrument intended\nto include all men; but they did not intend to declare all\nmen equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all were\nequal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social\ncapacity. They de\ufb01ned with tolerable distinctness in what\nrespects they did consider all men equal \u2014 equal in certain\ninalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the\npursuit of happiness. This they said and this they meant.\n They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all\nwere then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet that they\nwere about to confer it upon them. In fact, they had no\npower to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare\nthe right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast\nas circumstances should permit. They meant to set up a\nstandard maxim for free society, which should be familiar to\nall and revered by all; constantly looked to, constantly\nlabored for, and, even though never perfectly attained,\nconstantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading\nand deepening its in\ufb02uence, and augmenting the happiness\nand value of life to all people of all colors everywhere.\u201d\nThe project of making Kansas a slave state was in full\nprogress. The event which Mr. Lincoln had so distinctly\nprophesied \u2014 the formation of a pro-slavery constitution by\nunfair means and alien agents \u2014 was in full view; and those\nwho were interested in it did their best to prepare the\nminds of the people for it. Political morality seemed at its\nlowest ebb. A whole party was bowing to the behests of\nslavery, and those who were opposed to the institution and\nthe power born of it had become stupe\ufb01ed in the presence\nof its bold assumptions and rapid advances. People had\nceased to be surprised at any of its claims, and any\nexhibition of its spirit and policy. If Mr. Buchanan had any\nconscientious scruples, they were easily overborne, and he\nlent himself to the schemes of the plotters. A pro-slavery\nlegislature was elected mainly by non-residents, at an\nelection in which the free state men, who numbered three-\nfourths of the entire population, refused to participate, on\n account \nof \nillegality. \nThis \nlegislature, \nmeeting \nat\nLecompton, passed an act providing for the election of a\nconvention to form a state constitution, preparatory to\nasking an admission into the Union. In the election of the\nconvention, the free state men took no part, on the ground\nthat the legislature which ordered it had no legal authority.\nAbout two thousand votes were cast, while the legal voters\nin the territory numbered more than ten thousand. The\nLecompton Convention framed, of course, a pro-slavery\nconstitution. It is not necessary to recount the means by\nwhich this constitution was subsequently overthrown, and\none prohibiting slavery substituted in its place. It is\nsu\ufb00icient for the present purpose to state that upon the\npromulgation of the constitution formed at Lecompton,\nRobert \nJ. \nWalker, \nthen \nGovernor \nof \nKansas, \nwent\nimmediately to Washington to remonstrate against its\nadoption by Congress, and that before he could reach the\ncapitol it had received the approval of the President.\nThese facts have place here to give the basis of the\npolitical relations between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Douglas; for\nthey were approaching their great struggle. The senatorial\nterm of Mr. Douglas was drawing to a close, and he wished\nto be indorsed by the people of Illinois, and returned to the\nSenate. The events of the previous year had shown him that\na great political revolution was in progress, and that his\nseat was actually in danger. He saw what was going on in\nKansas, and knew that the iniquities in progress there\nwould be laid at his door. It was he who, in a time of peace,\nhad opened the \ufb02ood-gates of agitation. It was he who had\n given to the slave-power what it had not asked for, but\ncould not consistently refuse. It was he who had\ngratuitously o\ufb00ered the slave-power the privilege of making\nterritory forever set apart to freedom its own, if it could. He\nhad divided his own party in his own state, and was losing\nhis con\ufb01dence as to his own political future. That he knew\njust what was coming in Kansas, and knew what the e\ufb00ect\nwould be upon himself, is evident in the speech he made at\nSpring\ufb01eld, from Mr. Lincoln\u2019s reply to which a passage\nhas already been quoted. In this he undertook to shift to\nthe shoulders of the republican party the burden he felt to\nbe pressing upon his own. Speaking of Kansas, he said:\n\u201cThe law under which her delegates are about to be elected\nis believed to be just and fair in all its objects and\nprovisions... If any portion of the inhabitants, acting under\nthe advice of political leaders in distant states, shall choose\nto absent themselves from the polls, and withhold their\nvotes with the view of leaving the free state democrats in\nthe minority, and thus securing a pro-slavery constitution in\nopposition to the wishes of a majority of the people living\nunder it, let the responsibility rest on those who, for\npartisan purposes, will sacri\ufb01ce the principles they profess\nto cherish and promote. Upon them and upon the political\nparty for whose bene\ufb01t and under the direction of whose\nleaders they act, let the blame be visited of fastening upon\nthe people of a new state institutions repugnant to their\nfeelings and in violation of their wishes.\u201d\nIn a subsequent passage of this same speech, he\nampli\ufb01es these points, and both passages show that he\n knew the nature of the constitution that would be framed,\nknew that the free state men would not vote at all because\nthey believed the movement was an illegal one, and knew\nthat he and his party would be held responsible for the\noutrage. It is further to be said that, by his words on this\noccasion, he fully committed himself in advance, to\nwhatever the Lecompton Convention might do. \u201cThe\npresent election law in Kansas is acknowledged to be fair\nand just,\u201d he says. \u201cKansas is about to speak for herself,\u201d\nhe declares. By these words alone, be was morally\ncommitted to whatever might be the conclusions of the\nconvention. This is to be remembered, for Mr. Douglas soon\nfound that he could not shift the burden of the Kansas\niniquity upon the opposition, and that his only hope of a re-\nelection to the senate depended upon his taking issue with\nthe administration on this very case, and becoming the\nchampion of the anti-Lecompton men.\n",
    "1846-1853": "   ha ter I .\nTHE POLITICAL BIOGRAPHERS of Mr. Lincoln have stated\nthat in  he was \u201cinduced to accept\u201d the nomination for\nCongress from the Sangamon district. It has already been\nseen that he had aspirations for this place; and it is quite as\nwell to adopt Mr. Lincoln\u2019s own frankness and directness,\nand say that the representatives of his wishes secured the\nnomination for him. As a party man, he had well earned any\nhonor in the power of his party to bestow. As a man and a\npolitician, his character was so sound and so truly noble\nthat his nomination and election to Congress would be\nquite as honorable to his district as to him.\nHaving received the nomination, Mr. Lincoln did after the\nmanner of Western nominees and \u201cstumped\u201d his district.\nHe had abundant material for discussion. During the winter\nof , Texas was admitted to the Union, and the war with\nMexico was commenced. The tari\ufb00 of , constructed in\naccordance with the policy of the whig party, had been\nrepealed. The country had a foreign war on its hands \u2014 a\nwar which the whigs believed to have been unnecessarily\nbegun, and unjusti\ufb01ably carried on. It had received into the\nUnion a new member in the interest of slavery. It had been\ngreatly disturbed in its industrial interests by the\nsubversion of the protective policy. The issues between the\ntwo parties then in the political \ufb01eld were positive and well\n de\ufb01ned. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s position on all the principal points at\nissue was that of the whig party, and the party had no\nreason to be ashamed of its western champion.\nThe eminent popularity of Mr. Lincoln in his own district\nwas shown by the majority he received over that which it\nhad given to Mr. Clay. Although he had made Mr. Clay\u2019s\ncause his own, and had advocated his election with an\nenthusiasm which no personal object could have excited in\nhim, he received in his district a majority of one thousand\n\ufb01ve hundred and eleven votes to the nine hundred and\nfourteen majority which the district had given Mr. Clay in\n. He undoubtedly was supported by more than the\nstrength of his party, for his majority was unprecedented in\nthe district, and has since had no parallel. It was not\nreached, on a much larger vote, by General Taylor in .\nThere is no question that this remarkable majority was the\nresult of the popular faith in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s earnestness,\nconscientiousness and integrity.\nHe took his seat in the thirtieth Congress, December th,\n, and was from the \ufb01rst entirely at home. He was no\nnovice in politics or legislation. To the latter he had served\na thorough apprenticeship in the Illinois legislature. To the\nstudy and discussion of the former, he had devoted perhaps\nthe severest e\ufb00orts of his life. He understood every phase\nof the great questions which agitated Congress and divided\nthe people. Unlike many politicians who engage in the\nharangues of a political canvass, he had made himself the\nmaster of the subjects he discussed. He had been a debater,\nand not a declaimer. He had entertained a deeper interest\n in questions of public concern than he had felt in his own\nelection; and he was at once recognized as the peer of his\nassociates \nin \nthe \nHouse. \nHe \nderived \nconsiderable\nprominence from the fact that he was the only whig\nmember from Illinois, a fact almost entirely due to his own\npresence and in\ufb02uence in the district which elected him.\nIt is noticeable here that Stephen A. Douglas took his\nseat in the Senate of the United States during this same\nsession. They met \ufb01rst as representatives in the Illinois\nlegislature. Mr. Douglas was the younger, the more adroit,\nthe swifter in a political race. He had had with him the\nlarge democratic majority of the state, and had moulded it\nto his purposes. He had taken a step \u2014 perhaps many steps\n\u2014 in advance of Mr. Lincoln; but it seemed destined that\nthe tallest man in the House and the shortest man in the\nSenate should keep in sight of each other, until the time\nshould come when they should stand out before their own\nstate and the country as the champions respectively of the\nantagonistic principles and policies which divided the\nAmerican people.\nIt is interesting, at the close of a great rebellion,\nundertaken on behalf of slavery, to look back to this\nCongress, and see how, in the interests and associations of\nthe old whig party, those men worked in harmony who have\nsince been, or who, if they had lived, would have been, so\nwidely separated in feeling and action. John Quincy Adams\nvoted on most questions with Robert Toombs; George\nAshmun, afterwards president of the convention that\nnominated Mr. Lincoln for the presidency, with Alexander\n H. Stephens, afterwards vice-president of the Southern\nConfederacy; Jacob Collamer with Thomas Butler King, and\nSamuel F. Vinton with Henry W. Hilliard. History must\nrecord that the Mexican war was undertaken in the interest\nof human slavery; yet, touching the questions arising out of\nthis war, and questions directly associated with or bearing\nupon it, these men of the old whig party acted together. The\nslaveholder then yielded to party what he has since denied\nto patriotism, and patriotism abandoned a party which held\nout to it a constant temptation to complicity with slavery.\nMr. Polk, at that time the President of the United States,\nwas evidently anxious to justify the war which he had\ncommenced against Mexico, and to vindicate his own action\nbefore the American people, if not before his own judgment\nand conscience. His messages to Congress were burdened\nwith this e\ufb00ort; and Mr. Lincoln had hardly become wonted\nto his seat when he made an unsuccessful e\ufb00ort to bring\nthe President to a statement of facts, upon which Congress\nand the country might either verify or falsify his broad and\ngeneral asseverations. On the twenty-second of December,\nhe introduced a series of resolutions which, had they been\nadopted, would have given the President an opportunity to\nfurnish the grounds of his allegations, and set himself right\nbefore the nation. These resolutions are remarkable for\ntheir de\ufb01nite statement of the points actually at issue\nbetween the administration and the whig party; but they\nfound no advocates among Mr. Polk\u2019s friends. Laid over\nunder the rule, they were not called up again by Mr.\nLincoln himself, but they formed the thesis of a speech\n delivered by him on the following twelfth of January, in\nwhich he fully expressed his views on the whole subject.\nThe opposition in this Congress were placed in a very\ndi\ufb00icult and perplexing position. They hated the war; they\nbelieved it to have been unnecessarily begun by the act of\nthe United States, and not by the act of Mexico; they were\naccused of being treacherous to the cause and honor of the\ncountry because they opposed the war in which the country\nwas engaged; they felt obliged to vote supplies to the army\nbecause it would have been inhuman to do otherwise, yet\nthis act was seized upon by the President to show that his\nposition touching the war was sustained by them; they felt\ncompelled to condemn the commander-in-chief of the\narmies, sitting in the White House, and to vote thanks to\nthe generals who had successfully executed his orders in\nthe \ufb01eld. Men picked their way through these di\ufb00iculties\naccording to the wisdom given to them. The opposition\nusually voted together, though there was more or less of\ndivision on minor points and matters of policy.\nMr. Hudson of Massachusetts introduced a resolution\nwhich covered essentially the question of abandoning the\nwar \u2014 of restoring everything to the old status. Mr. Lincoln\nvoted to lay this resolution on the table, and, when it came\nup for adoption, voted against it. The writer \ufb01nds no record\nof the reasons for these votes. Whatever they may have\nbeen, they seemed good to him; and he took pains a few\ndays afterward to show that they could not have grown out\nof any friendship to the war. Indeed, on the very day which\nsaw these votes recorded, he had an opportunity to vote\n that the war \u201cwas unnecessarily and unconstitutionally\nbegun by the President of the United States,\u201d in company\nwith nearly all the whig members of the House, southern no\nless than northern. The same men voted thanks to General\nTaylor for his brilliant achievements in the war.\nThe speech of Mr. Lincoln on the twelfth of January, in\ncommittee \nof \nthe \nwhole \nHouse, \nwas \nthoroughly\ncharacteristic of the author. Simple, direct, exact in its\ncomprehension of the points at issue, without a super\ufb02uous\nword or sentence, as closely logical as if it were the work of\na professor of dialectics, it was the equal if not the superior\nof any speech delivered during the session.\nMr. Lincoln spoke as follows:\n\u201cMr. Chairman: Some, if not all, of the gentlemen on the\nother side of the House, who have addressed the committee\nwithin the last two days, have spoken rather complainingly,\nif I have rightly understood them, of the vote given a week\nor ten days ago, declaring that the war with Mexico was\nunnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the\nPresident. I admit that such a vote should not be given in\nmere party wantonness, and that the one given is justly\ncensurable, if it have no other or better foundation. I am\none of those who joined in that vote; and did so under my\nbest impression of the truth of the case. How I got this\nimpression, and how it may possibly be removed, I will now\ntry to show. When the war began, it was my opinion that all\nthose who, because of knowing too little, or because of\nknowing too much, could not conscientiously approve the\nconduct of the President (in the beginning of it), should,\n nevertheless, as good citizens and patriots, remain silent on\nthat point, at least till the war should be ended. Some\nleading Democrats, including ex-President Van Buren, have\ntaken this same view, as I understand them; and I adhered\nto it, and acted upon it, until since I took my seat here; and\nI think I should still adhere to it, were it not that the\nPresident and his friends will not allow it to be so. Besides\nthe continual e\ufb00ort of the President to argue every silent\nvote given for supplies into an indorsement of the justice\nand wisdom of his conduct; besides that singularly candid\nparagraph in his late message, in which he tells us that\nCongress, with great unanimity (only two in the Senate and\nfourteen in the House dissenting) had declared that \u2018by the\nact of the Republic of Mexico a state of war exists between\nthat Government and the United States,\u2019 when the same\njournals that informed him of this, also informed him that,\nwhen that declaration stood disconnected from the\nquestion of supplies, sixty-seven in the House, and not\nfourteen, merely, voted against it; besides this open\nattempt to prove by telling the truth, what he could not\nprove by telling the whole truth, demanding of all who will\nnot submit to be misrepresented, in justice to themselves,\nto speak out; besides all this, one of my colleagues  Mr.\nRichardson], at a very early day in the session, brought in a\nset of resolutions, expressly indorsing the original justice of\nthe war on the part of the President. Upon these\nresolutions, when they shall be put on their passage, I shall\nbe compelled to vote; so that I can not be silent it I would.\nSeeing this, I went about preparing myself to give the vote\n understandingly, when it should come. I carefully examined\nthe President\u2019s messages, to ascertain what he himself had\nsaid and proved upon the point. The result of this\nexamination was to make the impression, that, taking for\ntrue all the President states as facts, he falls far short of\nproving his justi\ufb01cation; and that the President would have\ngone further with his proof; if it had not been for the small\nmatter that the truth would not permit him. Under the\nimpression thus made I gave the vote before mentioned. I\npropose now to give, concisely, the process of the\nexamination I made, and how I reached the conclusion I\ndid.\n\u201cThe President, in his \ufb01rst message of May, ,\ndeclares that the soil was ours on which hostilities were\ncommenced by Mexico; and he repeats that declaration,\nalmost in the same language, in each successive annual\nmessage \u2014 thus showing that he esteems that point a\nhighly essential one. In the importance of that point I\nentirely agree with the President. To my judgment, it is the\nvery point upon which he should be justi\ufb01ed or condemned.\nIn his message of December, , it seems to have\noccurred to him, as is certainly true, that title, ownership to\nsoil, or anything else, is not a simple fact, but is a\nconclusion following one or more simple facts; and that it\nwas incumbent upon him to present the facts from which\nhe concluded the soil was ours on which the \ufb01rst blood of\nthe war was shed.\n\u201cAccordingly, a little below the middle of page twelve, in\nthe message last referred to, he enters upon that task;\n forming an issue and introducing testimony, extending the\nwhole to a little below the middle of page fourteen. Now, I\npropose to try to show that the whole of this \u2014 issue and\nevidence \u2014 is, from beginning to end, the sheerest\ndeception. The issue, as he presents it, is in these words:\n\u2018But there are those who, conceding all this to be true,\nassume the ground that the true western boundary of Texas\nis the Nueces, instead of the Rio Grande; and that,\ntherefore, in marching our army to the east bank of the\nlater river, we passed the Texan line, and invaded the\nterritory of Mexico.\u2019 Now, this issue is made up of two\na\ufb00irmatives and no negative. The main deception of it is,\nthat it assumes as true that one river or the other is\nnecessarily the boundary, and cheats the super\ufb01cial thinker\nentirely out of the idea that possibly the boundary is\nsomewhere between the two, and not actually at either. A\nfurther deception is, that it will let in evidence which a true\nissue would exclude. A true issue, made by the President,\nwould be about as follows; \u2018I say the soil was ours on which\nthe \ufb01rst blood was shed; there are those who say it was\nnot.\u2019\n\u201cI now proceed to examine the President\u2019s evidence, as\napplicable to such an issue. When that evidence is\nanalyzed, it is all included in the following propositions:\n\u201c. That the Rio Grande was the western boundary of\nLouisiana, as we purchased it of France in .\n\u201c. That the Republic of Texas always claimed the Rio\nGrande as her western boundary.\n\u201c. That by various acts, she had claimed it on paper.\n \u201c. That Santa Anna, in his treaty with Texas, recognized\nthe Rio Grande as her boundary.\n\u201c. That Texas before, and the United States after,\nannexation, had exercised jurisdiction beyond the Nueces,\nbetween the two rivers.\n\u201c. That our Congress understood the boundary of Texas\nto extend beyond the Nueces.\n\u201cNow for each of these in its turn:\n\u201cHis \ufb01rst item is, that the Rio Grande was the western\nboundary of Louisiana, as we purchased it of France in\n; and, seeming to expect this to be disputed, he argues\nover the amount of neary a page to prove it true; at the\nend of which, he lets us know that, by the treaty of ,\nwe sold to Spain the whole country, from the Rio Grande\neastward to the Sabine. Now, admitting for the present,\nthat the Rio Grande was the boundary of Louisiana, what,\nunder heaven, had that to do with the present boundary\nbetween us and Mexico? How, Mr. Chairman, the line that\nonce divided your land from mine can still be the boundary\nbetween us after I have sold my land to you, is, to me,\nbeyond all comprehension. And how any man, with an\nhonest purpose only of proving the truth, could ever have\nthought of introducing such a fact to prove such an issue, is\nequally incomprehensible. The outrage upon common right,\nof seizing as our own what we have once sold, merely\nbecause it was ours before we sold it, is only equaled by the\noutrage on common sense of any attempt to justify it.\n\u201cThe President\u2019s next piece of evidence is, that \u2018The\nRepublic of Texas always claimed this river (Rio Grande) as\n her western boundary.\u2019 That is not true, in fact. Texas has\nclaimed it, but she has not always claimed it. There is, at\nleast, one distinguished exception. Her State Constitution\n\u2014 the public\u2019s most solemn and well-considered act \u2014 that\nwhich may, without impropriety, be called her last will and\ntestament, revoking all others \u2014 makes no such claim. But\nsuppose she had always claimed it. Has not Mexico always\nclaimed the contrary? So that there is but claim against\nclaim, leaving nothing proved until we get back of the\nclaims, and \ufb01nd which has the better foundation.\n\u201cThough not in order in which the President presents his\nevidence, I now consider that class of his statements, which\nare, in substance, nothing more than that Texas has by\nvarious acts of her Convention and Congress, claimed the\nRio Grande as her boundary \u2014 on paper. I mean here what\nhe says about the \ufb01xing of the Rio Grande as her boundary,\nin her old Constitution (not her State Constitution,) about\nforming congressional districts, counties, etc. Now, all this\nis but naked claim; and what I have already said about\nclaims is strictly applicable to this. If I should claim your\nland by word of mouth, that certainly would not make it\nmine; and if I were to claim it by a deed which I had made\nmyself, and with which you had nothing to do, the claim\nwould be quite the same in substance, or rather in utter\nnothingness.\n\u201cI next consider the President\u2019s statement that Santa\nAnna, in his treaty with Texas, recognized the Rio Grande\nas the western boundary of Texas. Besides the position so\noften taken that Santa Anna, while a prisoner of war \u2014 a\n captive \u2014 could not bind Mexico by a treaty, which I deem\nconclusive; besides this, I wish to say something in relation\nto this treaty, so called by the President, with Santa Anna.\nIf any man would like to be amused by a sight at that little\nthing, which the President calls by that big name, he can\nhave it by turning to Niles\u2019 Register, volume , page .\nAnd if any one should suppose that Niles\u2019 Register is a\ncurious repository of so mighty a document as a solemn\ntreaty between nations, I can only sat that I learned, to a\ntolerable degree of certainty, by inquiry at the State\nDepartment, that the President himself never saw it\nanywhere else. By the way, I believe I should not err if I\nwere to declare, that during the \ufb01rst ten years of the\nexistence of that document, it was never by anybody called\na treaty; that it was never so called till the President, in his\nextremity, attempted, by so calling it, to wring something\nfrom it in justi\ufb01cation of himself in connection with the\nMexican war. It has none of the distinguishing features of a\ntreaty. It does not call itself a treaty. Santa Anna does not\ntherein assume to bind Mexico; he assumes only to act as\nPresident, Commander-in-Chief of the Mexican army and\nnavy; stipulates that the then present hostilities should\ncease, and that he would not himself take up arms, nor\nin\ufb02uence the Mexican people to take up arms against\nTexas, during the existence of the war of independence. He\ndid not recognize the independence of Texas; he did not\nassume to put an end to the war, but clearly indicated his\nexpectation of its continuance; he did not say one word\nabout boundary, and most probably never thought of it. It is\n stipulated therein that the Mexican forces should evacuate\nthe territory of Texas, passing to the other side of the Rio\nGrande; and in another article it is stipulated, that to\nprevent collisions between the armies, the Texan army\nshould not approach nearer than within \ufb01ve leagues \u2014 of\nwhat is not said \u2014 but clearly, from the object stated, it is\nof the Rio Grande. Now, if this is a treaty recognizing the\nRio Grande as the boundary of Texas, it contains the\nsingular feature of stipulating that Texas shall not go within\n\ufb01ve leagues of her own boundary.\n\u201cNext comes the evidence of Texas before annexation,\nand the United States afterward, exercising jurisdiction\nbeyond the Nueces, and between the two rivers. This actual\nexercise of jurisdiction is the very class or quality of\nevidence we want. It is excellent so far as it goes; but does\nit go far enough? He tells us it went beyond the Nueces,\nbut he does not tell us it went to the Rio Grande. He tells us\njurisdiction was exercised between the two rivers, but he\ndoes not tell us it was exercised over all the territory\nbetween them. Some simple-minded people think it\npossible to cross one river and go beyond it, without going\nall the way to the next; that jurisdiction may be exercised\nbetween two rivers without covering all the country\nbetween them. I know a man, not very unlike myself who\nexercises jurisdiction over a piece of land between the\nWabash and the Mississippi; and yet so far is this from\nbeing all there is between those rivers, that it is just one\nhundred and \ufb01fty-two feet long by \ufb01fty wide, and no part of\nit much within a hundred miles of either. He has a neighbor\n between him and the Mississippi \u2014 that is, just across the\nstreet, in that direction \u2014 whom, I am sure, he could\nneither persuade nor force to give up his habitation; but\nwhich, nevertheless, he could certainly annex, if it were to\nbe done, by merely standing on his own side of the street\nand claiming it, or even sitting down and writing a deed for\nit.\n\u201cBut next, the President tells us, the Congress of the\nUnited States understood the State of Texas they admitted\ninto the Union to extend beyond the Nueces. Well, I\nsuppose they did \u2014 I certainly so understand it \u2014 but how\nfar beyond? That Congress did not understand it to extend\nclear to the Rio Grande, is quite certain by the fact of their\njoint \nresolution \nfor \nadmission \nexpressly \nleaving \nall\nquestions of boundary to future adjustment. And, it may be\nadded, that Texas herself is proved to have had the same\nunderstanding of it that our Congress had, by the fact of\nthe exact conformity of her new Constitution to those\nresolutions.\n\u201cI am now through the whole of the President\u2019s evidence;\nand it is a singular fact, that if any one should declare the\nPresident sent the army into the midst of a settlement of\nMexican people, who had never submitted, by consent or\nby force to the authority or Texas or of the United States,\nand that there, and thereby, the \ufb01rst blood of the war was\nshed, there is not one word in all the President has said\nwhich would either admit or deny the declaration. In this\nstrange omission chie\ufb02y consists the deception of the\nPresident\u2019s evidence \u2014 an omission which, it does seem to\n me, could scarcely have occurred but by design. My way of\nliving leads me to be about the courts of justice; and there I\nhave some times seen a good lawyer, struggling for his\nclient\u2019s neck, in a desperate case, employing every arti\ufb01ce\nto work round, befog, and cover up with many words some\nposition pressed upon him by the prosecution, which he\ndared not admit, and yet could not deny. Party bias may\nhelp to make it appear so; but, with all the allowance I can\nmake for such bias, it still does appear to me that just such,\nand from just such necessity, are the President\u2019s struggles\nin this case.\n\u201cSome \ntime \nafter \nmy \ncolleague \n(Mr. \nRichardson)\nintroduced the resolutions I have mentioned, I introduced a\npreamble, resolution, and interrogatories, intended to draw\nthe President out, if possible, on this hitherto untrodden\nground. To show their relevancy, I propose to state my\nunderstanding of the true rule for ascertaining the\nboundary between Texas and Mexico. It is, that wherever\nTexas was exercising jurisdiction was hers; and wherever\nMexico was exercising jurisdiction was hers; and that\nwhatever separated the actual exercise of jurisdiction of\nthe one from that of the other, was the true boundary\nbetween them. If, as is probably true, Texas was exercising\njurisdiction along the western bank of the Nueces, and\nMexico was exercising it along the eastern bank of the Rio\nGrande, then neither river was the boundary, but the\nuninhabited country between the two was. The extent of\nour territory in that region depended not on any treaty-\n\ufb01xed boundary (for no treaty had attempted it), but on\n revolution. Any people anywhere, being inclined and having\nthe power, have the right to rise up and shake o\ufb00 the\nexisting government, and form a new one that suits them\nbetter. This is a most valuable, a most sacred right \u2014 a\nright which, we hope and believe, is to liberate the world.\nNor is this right con\ufb01ned to cases in which the whole\npeople of an existing government may choose to exercise it.\nAny portion of such people that can may revolutionize, and\nmake their own so much of the territory as they inhabit.\nMore than this, a majority of any portion of such people\nmay revolutionize, putting down a minority, intermingled\nwith, or near about them, who may oppose their\nmovements. Such minority was precisely the case of the\nTories of our own revolution. It is a quality of revolutions\nnot to go by old lines, or old laws; but to break up both, and\nmake new ones. As to the country now in question, we\nbought it of France in , and sold it to Spain in ,\naccording to the President\u2019s statement. After this, all\nMexico, including Texas, revolutionized against Spain; and\nstill later, Texas revolutionized against Mexico. In my view,\njust so far as she carried her revolution, by obtaining the\nactual, willing or unwilling submission of the people, so far\nthe country was hers, and no further.\n\u201cNow, sir, for the purpose of obtaining the very best\nevidence as to whether Texas had actually carried her\nrevolution to the place where the hostilities of the present\nwar \ncommenced, \nlet \nthe \nPresident \nanswer \nthe\ninterrogatories I proposed, as before mentioned, or some\nother similar ones. Let him answer fully, fairly and candidly.\n Let him answer with facts, and not with arguments. Let him\nremember \nhe \nsits \nwhere \nWashington \nsat; \nand, \nso\nremembering, let him answer as Washington would answer.\nAs a nation should not, and the Almighty will not, be\nevaded, so let him attempt no evasion, no equivocation.\nAnd if, so answering, he can show that the soil was ours\nwhere the \ufb01rst blood of the War was shed \u2014 that it was not\nwithin an inhabited country, or, if within such, that the\ninhabitants had submitted themselves to the civil authority\nof Texas, or of the United States, and that the same is true\nof the site of Fort Brown \u2014 then I am with him for his\njusti\ufb01cation. In that case, I shall be most happy to reverse\nthe vote I gave the other day. I have a sel\ufb01sh motive for\ndesiring that the President may do this; I expect to give\nsome votes, in connection with the war, which, without his\nso doing, will be of doubtful propriety, in my own judgment,\nbut which will be free from the doubt, if he does so. But if\nhe can not or will not do this \u2014 if, on any pretense, or no\npretense, he shall refuse or omit it \u2014 then I shall be fully\nconvinced, of what I more than suspect already, that he is\ndeeply conscious of being in the wrong; that be feels the\nblood of this war, like the blood of Abel, is crying to heaven\nagainst him; that he ordered General Taylor into the midst\nof a peaceful Mexican settlement, purposely to bring on a\nwar; that originally having some strong motive \u2014 what I\nwill not stop now to give my opinion concerning \u2014 to\ninvolve the two countries in a war, and trusting to escape\nscrutiny by \ufb01xing the public gaze upon the exceeding\nbrightness of military glory \u2014 that attractive rainbow that\n rises in showers of blood \u2014 that serpent\u2019s eye that charms\nto destroy \u2014 he plunged into it, and has swept on and on,\ntill, disappointed in his calculation of the ease with which\nMexico might be subdued, he now \ufb01nds himself he knows\nnot where. How like the half insane mumbling of a fever\ndream is the whole war part of the late message! At one\ntime telling us that Mexico has nothing whatever we can\nget but territory; at another, showing us how we can\nsupport the war by levying contributions on Mexico. At one\ntime urging the national honor, the security of the future,\nthe prevention of foreign interference, and even the good of\nMexico herself, as among the objects of the war; at another,\ntelling us that, \u2018to reject indemnity by refusing to accept a\ncession of territory, would be to abandon all out just\ndemands, and to wage the war, bearing all its expenses,\nwithout a purpose or de\ufb01nite object.\u2019 So, then, the national\nhonor, security of the future, and everything but territorial\nindemnity, may be considered the no purposes and\ninde\ufb01nite objects of the war! But having it now settled that\nterritorial indemnity is the only object, we are urged to\nseize, by legislation here, all that he was content to take a\nfew months ago, and the whole province of Lower\nCalifornia to boot, and to still carry on the war \u2014 to take all\nwe are \ufb01ghting for, and still \ufb01ght on. Again, the President is\nresolved, under all circumstances, to have full territorial\nindemnity for the expenses of the war; but he forgets to tell\nus how we are to get the excess after those expenses shall\nhave surpassed the value of the whole of the Mexican\nterritory. So, again, he insists that the separate national\n existence of Mexico shall be maintained; but he does not\ntell us how this can be done after we shall have taken all\nher territory. Lest the questions I here suggest be\nconsidered speculative merely, let me be indulged a\nmoment in trying to show they are not.\n\u201cThe war has gone on some twenty months, for the\nexpenses of which, together with an inconsiderable old\nscore, the President now claims about one half of the\nMexican territory, and that by far the better half, so far as\nconcerns our ability to make anything out of it. It is\ncomparatively uninhabited; so that we could establish land\no\ufb00ices in it, and raise some money in that way. But the\nother half is already inhabited, as I understand it, tolerably\ndensely for the nature of the country; and all its lands, or\nall that are valuable, already appropriated as private\nproperty. How, then, are we to make anything out of these\nlands with this incumbrance on them, or how remove the\nincumbrance? I suppose no one will say we should kill the\npeople, or drive them out, or make slaves of them, or even\ncon\ufb01scate their property? How, then, can we make much\nout of this part of the territory? If the prosecution of the\nwar has, in expenses, already equaled the better half of the\ncountry, how long its future prosecution will be in equaling\nthe less valuable half is not a speculative but a practical\nquestion, pressing closely upon us; and yet is is a question\nwhich the President seems never to have thought of.\n\u201cAs to the mode of terminating the war and securing\npeace, the President is equally wandering and inde\ufb01nite.\nFirst, it is to be done by a more vigorous prosecution of the\n war in the vital parts of the enemy\u2019s country; and, after\napparently talking himself tired on this point, the President\ndrops down into a half despairing tone, and tells us, that\n\u2018with a people distracted and divided by contending\nfactions, and a government subject to constant changes, by\nsuccessive revolutions, the continued success of our arms\nmay fail to obtain a satisfactory peace.\u2019 Then he suggests\nthe propriety of wheedling the Mexican people to desert\nthe counsels of their own leaders, and, trusting in our\nprotection, to set up a government from which we can\nsecure a satisfactory peace, telling us that \u2018 this may\nbecome the only mode of obtaining such a peace.\u2019 But soon\nhe falls into doubt of this too, and then drops back on to the\nalready \nhalf-abandoned \nground \nof \n\u2018more \nvigorous\nprosecution.\u2019 All this shows that the President is in no wise\nsatis\ufb01ed with his own positions. First, he takes up one, and,\nin attempting to argue us into it, he argues himself out of\nit; then seizes another, and goes through the same process;\nand then, confused at being able to think of nothing new, he\nsnatches up the old one again, which he has some time\nbefore cast o\ufb00. His mind, tasked beyond its power, is\nrunning hither and thither, like some tortured creature on a\nburning surface, \ufb01nding no position on which it can settle\ndown and be at ease.\n\u201cAgain, it is a singular omission in this message, that it\nnowhere intimates when the President expects the war to\nterminate. At its beginning, General Scott was, by this\nsame President, driven into disfavor, if not disgrace, for\nintimating that peace could not be conquered in less than\n three or four months. But now at the end of about twenty\nmonths, during which time our arms have given us the\nmost splendid successes \u2014 every department, and every\npart, land and water, o\ufb00icers and privates, regulars and\nvolunteers, doing all that men could do, and hundreds of\nthings which it had ever before been thought that men\ncould not do; after all this, this same President gives us a\nlong message without showing us that, as to the end, he\nhas himself even an imaginary conception. As I have before\nsaid, he knows not where he is. He is a bewildered,\nconfounded, and miserably-perplexed man. God grant he\nmay be able to show that there is not something about his\nconscience more painful than all his mental perplexity.\u201d\nWith this speech on record, it is strange that the genuine\nliterary abilities of the man were so long and so\npersistently ignored by literary people. There were men\nwho voted for him for the presidency more than twelve\nyears \nafterwards \n\u2014 \ntwelve \nyears \nof \nculture \nand\ndevelopment to him \u2014 who were surprised to \ufb01nd his\nmessages grammatically constructed, and who suspected\nthe intervention of a secretary whenever any touch of\nelegance appeared in his writings.\nMr. Lincoln had a position on the Committee on Post-\no\ufb00ices and Post-roads, and, from the knowledge in his\npossession, felt called upon a few days previous to the\nspeech on the war to expose a di\ufb00iculty between the\nPostmaster-general and a transportation company, anxious\nto get the \u201cGreat Southern Mail\u201d contract, and to get a\nbetter contract than the department had o\ufb00ered. The\n matter had excited some interest in Congress, and Mr.\nLincoln showed a faithful study of the facts of the case in\nhis speech and his freedom from any party feeling in the\nmatter, by supporting the position of the Post-master-\ngeneral.\nOn the st of June, , the National Whig Convention\nmet at Philadelphia to nominate a candidate for the\npresidency, and Mr. Lincoln was among its members. Mr.\nPolk, by his war with Mexico, had been engaged, much\nagainst his inclinations, in manufacturing available if not\nable candidates for his own place, two of whom afterwards\nachieved it. General Taylor had become a hero. The\nbrilliancy of his victories and the modesty of his dispatches\nhad awakened in his behalf the enthusiastic admiration of\nthe American people, without distinction of party. He was\nclaimed by the whigs as a member of that party, and\nregarded by them as the one man in the Union by whose\npopularity they might hope to win the power they coveted.\nThe majority would doubtless have preferred Mr. Clay, but\nMr. Clay had been their candidate, and had been beaten.\nMr. Lincoln would have been glad to support Mr. Clay, it is\nnot doubted, but he shared in the feeling of the majority\nconcerning his \u201cavailability.\u201d It is possible that his visit to\nMr. Clay, and its unsatisfactory results, already alluded to,\nhad somewhat blunted his devotion and subdued his\nenthusiasm on behalf of the great chieftain. Certain it is\nthat he was among those who believed that General Taylor\nand not Mr. Clay should be the nominee of his party.\n Congress had continued its session into the summer,\neither for purposes of business, or with the design to\ncontrol the nominating conventions, and do something to\ndirect the campaign; and when the nominations were made\nit did according to its custom, and immediately commenced\nthe campaign in a series of speeches. About two months\nafter General Taylor was nominated, (July twenty-seventh,)\nMr. Lincoln secured the \ufb02oor, and made a speech\nconcerning the points at issue between the two parties, and\nthe merits of the respective candidates, General Cass\nhaving received the nomination of the democratic party. It\nwas a telling, trenchant talk, rather than a speech \u2014 more\nlike one of his stump orations in Illinois than like his\nprevious e\ufb00orts in the House. As a campaign harangue,\ntouching the salient features of the principal questions in\ndebate, and revealing the weak points of one candidate and\nthe strong points of the other, it could not have been\nimproved. Considered as a part of the business which he\nwas sent to Washington to perform, it was execrable. He\ndid what others did, and what his partisan supporters\nexpected him to do; but his own sense of propriety must\nhave suggested to him, or ought to have suggested to him if\nit did not, the indecency of the practice of president-making\nin Congress.\nIn the light of subsequent events, the speech contains\nsome passages that are very curious and suggestive. In\nrevealing the position and policy of General Taylor in ,\nhe was unconsciously marking out his own in  and\n. General Taylor, in a letter to Mr. Allison, had said,\n \u201cupon the subject of the tari\ufb00, the currency, the\nimprovement of our great highways, rivers, lakes and\nharbors, the will of the people, as expressed through their\nrepresentatives in Congress, ought to be respected and\ncarried out by the executive.\u201d Mr. Lincoln, in remarking\nupon this, said: \u201cThe people say to General Taylor, \u2018if you\nare elected, shall we have a national bank?\u2019 He answers,\n\u2018Your will, gentlemen, not mine.\u2019 \u201cWhat about the tari\ufb00?\u2019\n\u2018Say yourselves.\u2019 \u2018Shall our rivers and harbors be\nimproved?\u2019 \u2018Just as you please. If you desire a bank, an\nalteration of the tari\ufb00; internal improvements, any or all, I\nwill not hinder you; if you do not desire them, I will not\nattempt to force them on you. Send up your members of\nCongress \nfrom \nthe \nvarious \ndistricts, \nwith \nopinions\naccording to your own, and if they are for these measures,\nor any of them, I shall have nothing to oppose; if they are\nnot for them, I shall not, by any appliances whatever,\nattempt to dragoon them into their adoption.\u2019\u201d From this\npoint Mr. Lincoln went on to show in what respect a\npresident is a representative of the people. He said: \u201cIn a\ncertain \nsense, \nand \nto \na \ncertain \nextent, \nhe \nis \na\nrepresentative of the people. He is elected by them as\nCongress is. But can he, in the nature of things, know the\nwants of the people as well as three hundred other men\ncoming from all the various localities of the nation? If so,\nwhere is the propriety of having a Congress?\u201d\nThere is much in this exposition of General Taylor\u2019s\nposition to remind us of that upon which the speaker\n himself subsequently stood, when invested with the powers\nof the chief magistracy.\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s dissection of General Cass\u2019 position upon\nthe \nquestions \nof \nthe \ncanvass, \nwas \ne\ufb00ected \nwith\ncharacteristic neatness and thoroughness. Alluding to the\nsubject of internal improvements Mr. Lincoln said, \u201cMy\ninternal improvement colleague (Mr. Wentworth) stated on\nthis \ufb02oor the other day that he was satis\ufb01ed Cass was for\nimprovements because that he had voted for all the bills\nthat he (Wentworth) had. So far, so good. But Mr. Polk\nvetoed some of these very bills; the Baltimore Convention\npassed a set of resolutions among other things approving\nthese vetoes, and Cass declares in his letter accepting the\nnomination that he has carefully read these resolutions,\nand that he adheres to them as \ufb01rmly as he approves them\ncordially. In other words, General Cass voted for the bills,\nand thinks the President did right to veto them; and his\nfriends here are amiable enough to consider him as being\none side or the other, just as one or the other may\ncorrespond with their own respective inclinations. My\ncolleague admits that the platform declares against the\nconstitutionality of a general system of improvements, and\nthat General Cass indorses the platform, but he still thinks\nGeneral Cass is in favor of some sort of improvements.\nWell, what are they? As he is against general objects, those\nhe is for must be particular and local. Now this is taking\nthe subject precisely by the wrong end. Particularity \u2014\nexpending the money of the whole people for an object\nwhich will bene\ufb01t a portion of them \u2014 is the greatest real\n objection to improvements, and has been so held by\nGeneral Jackson, Mr. Polk, and all others, I believe, till\nnow.\u201d Certainly this was a very logical exposition of General\nCass on internal improvements; and the charge of double\ndealing or gross inconsistency which it involved was\nunanswerable.\nMr. Lincoln tried his powers of ridicule on General Cass\non this occasion. One of his palpable hits has already been\nquoted in connection with the history of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nparticipation in the Black Hawk war, in which he draws a\nparallel between his own bloodless experiences and those\nof the democratic candidate. Quoting extracts to show how\nGeneral Cass had vacillated in his action on the Wilmot\nProviso, he added, \u201cThese extracts show that in \nGeneral Cass was for the Proviso at once, that in March,\n, he was still for it, but not just then; and that in\nDecember he was against it altogether. This is a true index\nto the whole man. When the question was raised in ,\nhe was in a blustering hurry to take ground for it, ...but\nsoon he began to see glimpses of the great democratic ox-\ngad waving in his face, and to hear indistinctly, a voice\nsaying, \u2018back! back, sir! back a little!\u2019 He shakes his head,\nand bats his eyes, and blunders back to his position of\nMarch, ; but still the gad waves, and the voice grows\nmore distinct and sharper still\u2014 \u2018back, sir! back, I say!\nfurther back!\u2019 and back he goes to the position of\nDecember, ; at which the gad is still, and the voice\nsoothingly says\u2014 \u2018so! stand still at that!\u2019\u201d The homely\n illustration, culled from his early experiences, was certainly\nforcible, if not elegant.\nIn this political canvass, the whigs found themselves\nnearly as much perplexed in the treatment of the Mexican\nwar as they had been in Congress. They had selected as\ntheir candidate a man whose reputation had been made by\nthe successful prosecution of a war which they had\nopposed. They were charged, of course, with inconsistency\nby their opponents, and were placed in the awkward\nposition of being obliged to draw nice distinctions. It is\npossible that they deserved the embarrassment from which\nthey su\ufb00ered. General Taylor had, beyond dispute, been\nnominated because be was a military hero, and not because\nhe had any natural or acquired \ufb01tness for the presidency.\nThe war had made him; and the whigs had seized upon this\nproduct of the war as an instrument by which they might\nacquire power. Mr. Lincoln aluded to this in his speech,\nbut showed that while the whigs had believed the war to be\nunnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun, they had voted\nsupplies, and sent their men. \u201cThrough su\ufb00ering and\ndeath,\u201d said he, \u201cby disease and in battle, they have\nendured, and fought, and fallen with you. Clay and Webster\neach gave a son, never to be returned. From the state of my\nown residence, besides other worthy but less known whig\nnames, we lent Marshall, Morrison, Baker and Hardin; they\nall fought, and one fell, and in the fall of that one we lost\nour best whig man. Nor were the whigs few in numbers, or\nlaggard in the day of danger. In that fearful, bloody,\nbreathless struggle at Buena Vista, when each man\u2019s hard\n task was to beat back \ufb01ve foes, or die himself, of the \ufb01ve\nhigh o\ufb00icers who perished, four were whigs.\u201d With an\nallusion to the distinction between the cause of the\nPresident in beginning the war, and the cause of the\ncountry after it was begun, Mr. Lincoln closed his speech.\nDuring the time these presidential discussions were\ngoing \non \nin \nCongress, \nMr. \nLincoln \nwas \nin \nclose\ncommunication with the whig leaders in Illinois, laying out\nthe work of the canvass, and trying to convert the active\nmen of the party to his own ideas of sound policy in the\nconduct of the campaign. Indeed, he began this work\nbefore General Taylor was nominated, under the evident\nconviction that he would be the candidate, and the strong\ndesire that he should be. As early in the year as February\ntwentieth, he wrote a letter to U.F. Linder, a prominent\nwhig orator of Illinois, on this subject. It betrays the\nperplexity to which more than one allusion has been made,\nof the whigs at the time. Mr. Lincoln says, in this letter, \u201cIn\nlaw, it is good policy to never plead what you need not, lest\nyou oblige yourself to prove what you cannot. Re\ufb02ect on\nthis well before you proceed. The application I mean to\nmake of this rule is that you should simply go for General\nTaylor, because you can take some democrats and lose no\nwhigs; but if you go also for Mr. Polk, on the origin and\nmode of prosecuting the war, you will still take some\ndemocrats, but you will lose more whigs, so that, in the\nsum of the operation, you will be loser. This is, at least, my\nopinion; and if you will look around, I doubt if you do not\ndiscover such to be the fact among your own neighbors.\n Further than this: by justifying Mr. Polk\u2019s mode of\nprosecuting the war, you put yourself in opposition to\nGeneral Taylor himself, for we all know he has declared for,\nand, in fact, originated, the defensive line policy.\u201d\nIn this letter, Mr. Lincoln talks like a politician (and he\nwas one of the most acute that the country ever produced,)\nto a politician. It looks as if he were handling grave\nquestions of state with reference only to party ends; but the\nletter does not represent him wholly. In a subsequent note\nto the same friend, in answer to the question whether \u201cit\nwould not be just as easy to elect General Taylor without\nopposing the war, as by opposing it,\u201d he replies: \u201cthe\nlocofocos here will not let the whigs be silent, ...so that\nthey are compelled to speak, and their only option is\nwhether they will, when they speak, tell the truth; or tell a\nfoul, villainous and bloody falsehood.\u201d In this declaration,\nthe politician sinks, and the man rises, and seems to be\nwhat he really is \u2014 honest and conscientious.\nOn the fourteenth day of August, the \ufb01rst session of the\nThirtieth Congress came to a close, and the members went\nhome to continue and complete the campaign which they\nhad inaugurated at Washington. The session had been one\nof strong excitements, particular interest attaching to every\nimportant debate in consequence of its bearing upon the\nquestion of the presidency. Mr. Lincoln had discharged his\nduties well \u2014 ably and conscientiously, at least. He found to\nhis regret that he had not entirely pleased his constituents\nin his course on the questions connected with the war. It is\nprobable that he could have secured a renomination had he\n himself been Willing to risk the result. That a man with his\ndesire for public life would willingly retire from Congress at\nthe end of a single term of service is not probable; and\nwhile it has been said that he peremptorily refused to be\nagain considered a candidate, on account of his desire to\nengage more exclusively in the duties of his profession, it is\nnot credible that this was his only motive. Indeed, there is\nevidence that he sought another o\ufb00ice, in consequence of\nthe fact that his professional business had su\ufb00ered so\nseverely by his absence that he would have been glad to\nquit it altogether. He was in no hurry to return to it,\ncertainly, for at the close of the session, he visited New\nEngland, and made a number of very e\ufb00ective campaign\nspeeches, and then went home, and devoted his time to the\ncanvass for the election of General Taylor until he had the\nsatisfaction of witnessing the triumph of his candidate, and\nthe national success of the party to whose fortunes he had\nbeen so long and so warmly devoted.\nIn his own district, Mr. Lincoln helped to give General\nTaylor a majority nearly equal to that by which he had been\nelected to Congress. The general result of the election\nbrought to him great satisfaction. It justi\ufb01ed his own\njudgment \ntouching \nthe \ncandidate\u2019s \navailability, \nand\npromised a return to the policy which he believed essential\nto the welfare of the country. But little time was left\nbetween the close of the canvass and the commencement of\nthe second session, so that Mr. Lincoln had no more than\nsu\ufb00icient space for the transaction of his personal business\n at home, before he was obliged to take his departure again\nfor Washington.\nThe second session of this Congress was comparatively a\nquiet one. Several months had elapsed since the treaty of\nGuadalupe Hidalgo had rati\ufb01ed peace between the United\nStates \nand \nMexico, \nthe \npresidential \ncampaign \nhad\ntranspired, and the national political caldron had ceased to\nboil. Mr. Lincoln carried into this session the anti-slavery\nrecord of an anti-slavery whig. He had voted forty-two\ntimes for the Wilmot Proviso, had stood \ufb01rmly by John\nQuincy Adams and Joshua R. Giddings on the right of\npetition, and was recognized as a man who would do as\nmuch in opposition to slavery as his constitutional\nobligations would permit him to do. Early in the session,\nMr. Gott of New York introduced a resolution instructing\nthe Committee on the District of Columbia to report a bill\nprohibiting the slave trade in the District. The language of\nthe preamble upon which the resolution was based was\nvery strong, and doubtless seemed to Mr. Lincoln\nunnecessarily o\ufb00ensive; and we \ufb01nd him voting with the\npro-slavery men of the House to lay it on the table, and\nsubsequently voting against its adoption. He had probably\nbeen maturing a measure which he intended should cover\nthe same ground, in another way, and on the sixteenth of\nJanuary he introduced a substitute for this resolution,\nwhich had been carried along under a motion to reconsider.\nIt provided that no person not within the District, and no\nperson thereafter born within the District, should be held\nto slavery within the District; or held to slavery without its\n limits, while it provided that those holding slaves in the\nslave states might bring them in and take them out again,\nwhen visiting the District on public business. It also\nprovided for the emancipation of all the slaves legally held\nwithin the District, at the will of their masters, who could\nclaim their full value at the hands of the government, and\nthat the act itself should be subject to the approval of the\nvoters of the District. The bill had also a provision, \u201cthat\nthe municipal authorities of Washington and Georgetown,\nwithin their respective jurisdictional limits,\u201d should be\n\u201cempowered and required to provide active and e\ufb00icient\nmeans to arrest and deliver up to their owners all fugitive\nslaves escaping into said District.\u201d\nIf any evidence were needed to establish the fact that Mr.\nLincoln regarded slaves as property under the Constitution,\nthis bill would seem to furnish all that is desired. If he did\nnot so regard them, this bill convicts him of friendliness\nrather than enmity to slavery. If he did not so regard them,\nhis whole record relating to slavery was a record of\nduplicity. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s character as an anti-slavery man\ncan have no consistency on any basis except that of his \ufb01rm\nbelief that slaves were recognized as property under the\nConstitution of the United States; and those who impute to\nhim the opposite opinion, or action based upon the opposite\nopinion, in\ufb02ict a wrong upon his memory. He recognized\nslaves as property not only in Congress, but on the stump\nand even in his business. He was once employed by General\nMatteson of Bourbon County, Kentucky, who had brought\n\ufb01ve or six negroes into Coles County, Illinois, and worked\n them on a farm for two or three years, to get them out or\nthe hands of the civil authorities, which had interfered to\nkeep him from taking them back to Kentucky. Judge Wilson\nand Judge Treat, both of the Supreme Court, sat on the\ncase, and decided against the claim of the slaveholder, as\npresented by Mr. Lincoln. It is remembered that he made a\nvery poor plea, and exercised a good deal of research in\npresenting the authorities for and against, and that all his\nsympathies were on the side of the slaves, but such a man\nas Mr. Lincoln would never have consented to act on this\ncase if he had not believed that slaves were recognized as\nproperty by the Constitution. It is true that in a speech\ndelivered afterwards, during the famous Douglas campaign,\nhe denied the statement made by the Supreme Court in the\nDred Scott decision, that \u201cthe right of property in a slave is\ndistinctly and expressly a\ufb00irmed in the Constitution;\u201d but\nthere was to him, and there is in fact, a great di\ufb00erence\nbetween a distinct and express a\ufb00irmation, and a real\nthough it may be only a tacit recognition of property in a\nslave. Slavery was to him legally right and morally wrong.\nHe was equally loyal to the Constitution and loving to his\nkind; and when the time came which gave him the privilege\nof striking o\ufb00 the fetters of the slave, in order to preserve\nthe country and its Constitution, he did it, and counted the\nact the crowning one of his life.\nMr. Lincoln did not bring his bill forward without\nconsultation. Mr. Seaton, of the National Intelligencer, is\nunderstood to have been most in his con\ufb01dence; and Mr.\nLincoln said, on presenting his bill to the House, that he\n was authorized to say that, of about \ufb01fteen of the leading\ncitizens of the District to whom the proposition had been\nsubmitted, there Was not one who did not give it his\napproval. A substitute for the bill was moved, and \ufb01nally\nthe whole subject was given up, and left to take its place\namong the un\ufb01nished business of the Congress. The reason\nfor this is reported to have been Mr. Seaton\u2019s withdrawal\nfrom the support of the plan; and Mr. Seaton\u2019s withdrawal\nfrom the support of the plan is said to have been owing to\nthe visits and expostulations of members of Congress from\nthe slave states. Mr. Lincoln could hope to do nothing\nwithout the approval of the voters of the District, and to\nsecure this approval he must secure the support of the\nNational Intelligencer. That taken from his scheme, he took\nno further interest in pursuing it.\nMr. Lincoln had other occasions, during the session, to\nrecord his votes against slavery, in his own moderate way\n\u2014 always moved by his humanity and his love of that which\nwas morally right, and withheld and controlled by his\nobligations to the Constitution and the law, as he\napprehended those obligations.\nThe fourth of March brought his Congressional career to\na close. While he had maintained a most respectable\nposition in the House, there is no reason to believe that he\nmade any great impression upon legislation, or upon the\nmind of the country. His highest honors were to be won in\nanother \ufb01eld, for which his two years in the House were in\npart a preparation. After his return to Spring\ufb01eld, he found\nhis practice dissipated. He saw that he should be obliged to\n begin again. Business, for the time, had taken new\nchannels, as it never fails to do in like cases. The charms of\nthe old life in Washington came back to him, and he was\nready to take an o\ufb00ice. He had a fancy that he would like to\nbe Commissioner of the General Land O\ufb00ice, and Mr.\nDefrees, now the superintendent of public printing at\nWashington, and then the editor of the Indiana State\nJournal, wrote an extended article, urging his appointment,\nand published it in that newspaper. The e\ufb00ort miscarried,\nvery much to Mr. Lincoln\u2019s and the country\u2019s advantage;\nand Mr. Butter\ufb01eld of Illinois secured the coveted place.\nThe unsuccessful application for this appointment was\nsubsequently a theme of much merriment between Mr.\nLincoln and his friends.\n   ha ter  .\nON RETURNING TO his home, Mr. Lincoln entered upon the\nduties of his profession, and devoted himself to them\nthrough a series of years, less disturbed by diversions into\nstate and national politics than he had been during any\nprevious period of his business life. It was to him a time of\nrest, of reading, of social happiness and of professional\nprosperity. He was already a father, and took an almost\nunbounded pleasure in his children. Their sweet young\nnatures were to him a perpetual source of delight. He was\nnever impatient with their petulance and restlessness,\nloved always to be with them, and took them into his heart\nwith a fondness which was unspeakable. It was a fondness\nso tender and profound as to blind him to their\nimperfections, and to expel from him every particle of\nsternness in his management of them. It must be said that\nhe had very little of what is called parental government.\nThe most that he could say to any little rebel in his\nhousehold was, \u201cyou break my heart, when you act like\nthis;\u201d and the loving eyes and a\ufb00ectionate voice and\nsincere expression of pain were usually enough to bring the\nculprit to his senses and his obedience. A young man bred\nin Spring\ufb01eld speaks of a vision that has clung to his\nmemory very vividly, of Mr. Lincoln as he appeared in those\ndays. His way to school led by the lawyer\u2019s door. On almost\n any fair summer morning, he could \ufb01nd Mr. Lincoln on the\nsidewalk, in front of his house, drawing a child backward\nand forward, in a child\u2019s gig. Without hat or coat, and\nwearing a pair of rough shoes, his hands behind him\nholding to the tongue of the gig, and his tall form bent\nforward to accommodate himself to the service, he paced\nup and down the walk, forgetful of everything around him,\nand intent only on some subject that absorbed his mind.\nThe young man says he remembers wondering, in his\nboyish way, how so rough and plain a man should happen to\nlive in so respectable a house.\nThe habit of mental absorption \u2014 absent-mindedness, as\nit is called \u2014 was common with him always, but particularly\nduring the formative periods of his life. The New Salem\npeople, it will be remembered, thought him crazy, because\nhe passed his best friends in the street without seeing\nthem. At the table, in his own family, he often sat down\nwithout knowing or realizing where he was, and ate his\nfood mechanically. When he \u201ccame to himself,\u201d it was a\ntrick with him to break the silence by the quotation of some\nverse of poetry from a favorite author. It relieved the\nawkwardness of \u201cthe situation,\u201d served as a blind to the\nthoughts \nwhich \nhad \npossessed \nhim, \nand \nstarted\nconversation in a channel that led as far as possible from\nthe subject that he had set aside.\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s lack of early advantages and the limited\ncharacter of his education were constant subjects of regret\nwith him. His intercourse with members of Congress and\nwith the cultivated society of Washington had, without\n doubt, made him feel his de\ufb01ciencies more keenly than\never before. There is no doubt that his successes were a\nconstant surprise to him. He felt that his acquisitions were\nvery humble, and that the estimate which the public placed\nupon him was, in some respects, a blind and mistaken one.\nIt was at this period that be undertook to improve himself\nsomewhat by attention to mathematics, and actually\nmastered the \ufb01rst six books of Euclid. In speaking of this\nnew acquisition to a friend, he said that, in debates, he had\nfrequently heard the word \u201cdemonstration\u201d used, and he\ndetermined to ascertain for himself what it meant. After his\nmastery of geometry, he had no further uncertainty on the\nsubject.\nAllusion has been made to Mr. Lincoln\u2019s mechanical\ngenius. That he had enough of this to make him a good\nmechanic, there is no doubt. With such rude tools as were\nat his command he had made cabins and \ufb02at-boats; and\nafter his mind had become absorbed in public and\nprofessional a\ufb00airs he often recurred to his mechanical\ndreams for amusement. One of his dreams took form, and\nhe endeavored to make a practical matter of it. He had had\nexperience in the early navigation of the Western rivers.\nOne of the most serious hinderances to this navigation was\nlow water, and the lodgment of the various craft on the\nshifting shoals and bars with which these rivers abound. He\nundertook to contrive an apparatus which, folded to the\nhull of a boat like a bellows, might be in\ufb02ated on occasion,\nand, by its levity, lift it over any obstruction upon which it\nmight rest. On this contrivance, illustrated by a model\n whittled out by himself, and now preserved in the patent\no\ufb00ice at Washington, he secured letters patent; but it is\ncertain that the navigation of the Western rivers was not\nrevolutionized by it.\nMr. Lincoln never made his profession lucrative to\nhimself. It was very di\ufb00icult for him to charge a heavy fee\nto anybody, and still more di\ufb00icult for him to charge his\nfriends anything at all for professional services. To a poor\nclient, he was quite as apt to give money as to take it from\nhim. He never encouraged the spirit of litigation. Henry\nMcHenry, one of his old clients, says that he went to Mr.\nLincoln with a case to prosecute, and that Mr. Lincoln\nrefused to have anything to do with it, because he was not\nstrictly in the right. \u201cYou can give the other party a great\ndeal of trouble,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cand perhaps beat him,\nbut you had better let the suit alone.\u201d Mr. Lincoln had on\nhand a case for this same gentleman for three years, and\ntook it through three courts to the Supreme Court, and\ncharged him for his services only seventy-\ufb01ve dollars. His\nwants were not large. He had no expensive vices, took no\ndelight in \ufb01ne clothing, and had no strong desire to\naccumulate money. Indeed, after all his years of practice,\nwhich closed only with his election to the presidency, he\nhad accumulated, as the sum total of all his gold and goods,\nonly the estimated value of sixteen thousand dollars.\nSome incidents illustrating his practice, and the motives\nwhich controlled him in it, may with propriety be stated\nhere, although they are not all of them associated with this\nperiod of his life. An old woman of seventy-\ufb01ve years, the\n widow of a revolutionary pensioner, came tottering into his\no\ufb00ice one day, and, taking a seat, told him that a certain\npension agent had charged her the exorbitant fee of two\nhundred dollars for collecting her claim. Mr. Lincoln was\nsatis\ufb01ed by her representations that she had been\nswindled, and \ufb01nding that she was not a resident or the\ntown, and that she was poor, gave her money, and set about\nthe work of procuring restitution. He immediately entered\nsuit against the agent to recover a portion of his ill-gotten\nmoney. The suit was entirely successful, and Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\naddress to the jury before which the case was tried is\nremembered to have been peculiarly touching in its\nallusions to the poverty of the widow, and the patriotism of\nthe husband she had sacri\ufb01ced to secure the nation\u2019s\nindependence. He had the grati\ufb01cation of paying back to\nher a hundred dollars, and sending her home rejoicing. One\nafternoon an old negro woman came into the o\ufb00ice of\nLincoln \n Herndon, and told the story of her trouble, to\nwhich both lawyers listened. It appeared that she and her\no\ufb00spring were born slaves in Kentucky, and that her owner,\none Hinkle, had brought the whole family into Illinois, and\ngiven them their freedom. Her son had gone down the\nMississippi as a waiter or deck hand, on a steamboat.\nArriving at New Orleans, he had imprudently gone ashore,\nand had been snatched up by the police, in accordance with\nthe law then in force concerning free negroes from other\nstates, and thrown into con\ufb01nement. Subsequently he was\nbrought out and tried. Of course he was \ufb01ned, and, the boat\nhaving left, he was sold, or was in immediate danger of\n being sold, to pay his \ufb01ne and the expenses. Mr. Lincoln\nwas very much moved, and requested Mr. Herndon to go\nover to the State House, and inquire of Governor Bissell if\nthere was not something that he could do to obtain\npossession of the negro. Mr. Herndon made the inquiry, and\nreturned with the report that the Governor regretted to say\nthat he had no legal or constitutional right to do anything\nin the premises. Mr. Lincoln rose to his feet in great\nexcitement, and exclaimed, \u201cBy the Almighty, I\u2019ll have that\nnegro back soon, or I\u2019ll have a twenty years\u2019 agitation in\nIllinois, until the Governor does have a legal and\nconstitutional right to do something in the premises.\u201d He\nwas saved from the latter alternative \u2014 at least in the\ndirect form which he proposed. The lawyers sent money to\na New Orleans correspondent \u2014 money of their own \u2014 who\nprocured the negro, and returned him to his mother.\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s early athletic struggle with Jack Armstrong,\nthe representative man of the \u201cClary\u2019s Grove Boys,\u201d will be\nremembered. From the moment of this struggle, which Jack\nagreed to call \u201ca drawn battle,\u201d in consequence of his own\nfoul play, they became strong friends. Jack would \ufb01ght for\nMr. Lincoln at any time, and would never bear him spoken\nagainst. Indeed, there were times when young Lincoln\nmade Jack\u2019s cabin his home, and here Mrs. Armstrong, a\nmost womanly person, learned to respect the rising man.\nThere was no service to which she did not make her guest\nabundantly welcome, and he never ceased to feel the\ntenderest gratitude for her kindness. At length, her\nhusband died, and she became dependent upon her sons.\n The oldest of these, while in attendance upon a camp-\nmeeting, found himself involved in a melee, which resulted\nin the death of a young man; and young Armstrong was\ncharged by one of his associates with striking the fatal\nblow. He was arrested, examined, and imprisoned to await\nhis trial. The public mind was in a blaze of excitement, and\ninterested parties fed the \ufb02ame. Mr. Lincoln knew nothing\nof the merits of this case, that is certain. He only knew that\nhis old friend Mrs. Armstrong was in sore trouble; and he\nsat down at once, and volunteered by letter to defend her\nson. His \ufb01rst act was to procure the postponement and a\nchange of the place of the trial. There was too much fever\nin the minds of the immediate public to permit of fair\ntreatment. When the trial came on, the case looked very\nhopeless to all but Mr. Lincoln, who had assured himself\nthat the young man was not guilty. The evidence on behalf\nof the state being all in, and looking like a solid and\nconsistent mass of testimony against the prisoner, Mr.\nLincoln undertook the task of analyzing and destroying it,\nwhich he did in a manner that surprised every one. The\nprincipal witness testi\ufb01ed that \u201cby the aid of the brightly\nshining moon, he saw the prisoner in\ufb02ict the death blow\nwith a slung shot.\u201d Mr. Lincoln proved by the almanac that\nthere was no moon shining at the time. The mass of\ntestimony against the prisoner melted away, until \u201cnot\nguilty\u201d was the verdict of every man present in the crowded\ncourt-room. There is, of course, no record of the plea made\non this occasion, but it is remembered as one in which Mr.\nLincoln made an appeal to the sympathies of the jury which\n quite surpassed his usual e\ufb00orts of the kind, and melted all\nto tears. The jury were out but half an hour, when they\nreturned with their verdict of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d The widow\nfainted in the arms of her son, who divided his attention\nbetween his services to her and his thanks to his deliverer.\nAnd thus the kind woman who cared for the poor young\nman, and showed herself a mother to him in his need,\nreceived the life of a son, saved from a cruel conspiracy, as\nher reward, from the hand of her grateful bene\ufb01ciary.\nThe lawyers of Spring\ufb01eld, particularly those who had\npolitical aspirations, were afraid to undertake the defense\nof anyone who had been engaged in helping o\ufb00 fugitive\nslaves. It was a very unpopular business in those days and\nin that locaity; and few felt that they could a\ufb00ord to\nengage in it. One who needed such aid went to Edward D.\nBaker, and was refused defense distinctly and frankly, on\nthe ground that, as a political man, he could not a\ufb00ord it.\nThe man applied to an ardent anti-slavery friend for advice.\nHe spoke of Mr. Lincoln, and said, \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of an\nunpopular case. When I go for a lawyer to defend an\narrested fugitive slave, other lawyers will refuse me, but if\nMr. Lincoln is at home, he will always take my case.\u201d\nA sheep-grower sold a number of sheep at a stipulated\naverage price. When he delivered the animals, he delivered\nmany lambs, or sheep too young to come fairly within the\nterms of the contract. He was sued for damages by the\ninjured party, and Mr. Lincoln was his attorney. At the trial,\nthe facts as to the character of the sheep delivered were\nproved, and several witnesses testi\ufb01ed as to the usage by\n which all under a certain age were regarded as lambs, and\nof inferior value. Mr. Lincoln, on comprehending the facts,\nat once changed his line of e\ufb00ort, and con\ufb01ned himself to\nascertaining the real number of inferior sheep delivered.\nOn addressing the jury, he said that from the facts proved\nthey must give a verdict against his client, and he only\nasked their scrutiny as to the actual damage su\ufb00ered.\nIn another case, Mr. Lincoln was conducting a suit\nagainst a railroad company. Judgment having been given in\nhis favor, and the court being about to allow the amount\nclaimed by him, deducting a proved and allowed o\ufb00set, he\nrose and stated that his opponents had not proved all that\nwas justly due them in o\ufb00set; and proceeded to state and\nallow a further sum against his client, which the court\nallowed in its judgment. His desire for the establishment of\nexact justice always overcame his own sel\ufb01sh love of\nvictory, as well as his partiality for his clients\u2019 feelings and\ninterests.\nThese \nincidents \nsu\ufb00iciently \nillustrate \nthe \nhumane\nfeelings and thorough honesty which Mr. Lincoln carried\ninto the practice of his profession, and, as allusion has\nalready been made to the high estimate placed by the\npeople upon his ability as a lawyer, it will be proper to\nrecord here the high opinion of his professional merits\nentertained by the most eminent representatives of the bar\nof Illinois. His death in  was, in accordance with\nusage, made the subject of notice by the various courts of\nthe state. The Supreme Court in session at Ottawa,\nreceived a series of resolutions from the bar, which were\n placed upon its records. Ex-Judge Caton, in presenting\nthem, said, \u201cHe (Mr. Lincoln) understood the relations of\nthings, and hence his deductions were rarely wrong, from\nany given state of facts. So he applied the principles of law\nto the transactions of men with great clearness and\nprecision. He was a close reasoner. He reasoned by\nanalogy, and enforced his views by apt illustration. His\nmode \nof \nspeaking \nwas \ngenerally \nof \na \nplain \nand\nunimpassioned character, and yet, he was the author of\nsome of the most beautiful and eloquent passages in our\nlanguage, which, if collected, would form a valuable\ncontribution to American literature. The most punctilious\nhonor ever marked his professional and private life.\u201d\nJudge Breese, in responding to the resolutions and the\nremarks of Judge Caton, was still more outspoken in his\nhigh opinion of Mr. Lincoln, as a lawyer. \u201cFor my single\nself,\u201d he said, \u201cI have for a quarter of a century regarded\nMr. Lincoln as the \ufb01nest lawyer I ever knew, and of a\nprofessional bearing so high-toned and honorable as justly,\nand without derogating from the claims of others, entitling\nhim to be presented to the profession as a model well\nworthy of the closest imitation.\u201d Judge Thomas Drummond\nof Chicago, representing the bar of that city, said, \u201cI have\nno hesitation in saying that he was one of the ablest\nlawyers I have ever known.\u201d In addition, he said, \u201cno\nintelligent man who ever watched Mr. Lincoln through a\nhard-contested case at the bar, questioned his great\nability.\u201d Judge Drummond\u2019s picture of Mr. Lincoln at the\n bar, and his mode of speech and action is so graphic and so\njust that it deserves to be quoted:\n\u201cWith a voice by no means pleasant, and, indeed, when\nexcited, in its shrill tones, sometimes almost disagreeable;\nwithout any of the personal graces of the orator; without\nmuch in the outward man indicating superiority of intellect;\nwithout great quickness of perception \u2014 still, his mind was\nso vigorous, his comprehension so exact and clear, and his\njudgment so sure, that he easily mastered the intricacies of\nhis profession, and became one of the ablest reasoners and\nmost impressive speakers at our bar. With a probity of\ncharacter known to all, with an intuitive insight into the\nhuman heart, with a clearness of statement which was\nitself an argument, with uncommon power and felicity of\nillustration, \u2014 often, it is true, of a plain and homely kind,\n\u2014 and with that sincerity and earnestness of manner which\ncarried conviction, he was, perhaps, one of the most\nsuccessful jury lawyers we have ever had in the state. He\nalways tried a case fairly and honestly. He never\nintentionally misrepresented the evidence of a witness or\nthe argument of an opponent. He met both squarely, and, if\nhe could not explain the one or answer the other,\nsubstantially admitted it. He never misstated the law\naccording to his own intelligent view of it.\u201d\nThese tributes to the professional excellence of Mr.\nLincoln, by those best quali\ufb01ed to judge it, is all the more\nsigni\ufb01cant from the fact that it was rendered by those who,\nthroughout his whole career, were opposed to him\npolitically \u2014 by democrats and conservatives. Judge David\n Davis, of Bloomington, Illinois, a strong personal friend of\nMr. Lincoln , in responding to resolutions presented by the\nbar of Indianapolis, said that \u201cin all the elements that\nconstitute the great lawyer, he (Mr. Lincoln) had few\nequals. He was great both at Nisi Prius and before an\nappellate tribunal. He seized the strong points of a case,\nand presented them with clearness and great compactness.\nA vein of humor never deserted him, and he was always\nable to chain the attention of court and jury when the cause\nwas the most uninteresting, by the appropriateness of his\nanecdotes.\u201d\nIt was during this period of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s life that he was\ncalled upon to pronounce a . The death of this eminent\nstatesman occurred in , and the citizens of Spring\ufb01eld\nthought of no man so competent to do his memory justice\nas he who had through so many years been devoted to his\ninterests and his political principles. The eulogy was\npronounced in the State House, and was listened to by a\nlarge audience. The discourse, as it was printed in the city\nnewspapers of the day, was by no means a remarkable one.\nIt is remembered as a very dull one at its delivery, and was\nso regarded by Mr. Lincoln himself, who complained that he\nlacked the imagination necessary for a performance of that\ncharacter. It is possible that the e\ufb00ect upon his mind of the\nold visit to Ashland was not entirely obliterated; for Mr.\nLincoln was quite accustomed to \ufb01nd expression for any\nadmiration that was really within him. The closing words of\nthe eulogy, though hortatory in form, were prophetic in\nfact, and, in the light of subsequent events, have a touching\n interest. \u201cSuch a man,\u201d said he, \u201cthe times have demanded,\nand such in the Providence of God was given us. But he is\ngone. Let us strive to deserve, as far as mortals may, the\ncontinued care of Divine Providence, trusting that in future\nnational emergencies he will not fail to provide us the\ninstruments of safety and security.\u201d That Divine Providence\nwhich he so con\ufb01dently trusted then, trusted him as the\ninstrument for executing its own designs, in the greatest of\nnational emergencies.\nIt is not to be supposed that during these years of quiet\nprofessional Mr. Lincoln was entirely indi\ufb00erent to the\ncourse of political a\ufb00airs. Great national events were in\nprogress, which must have impressed him profoundly. The\nslave states, conscious that power was departing from\nthem, were desperate in their e\ufb00orts and fruitful in their\nexpedients to retain it. On the th of September, , the\nfree state of California was admitted to the Union. There\nwas a double bitterness in this measure to those interested\nin the perpetuation of the in\ufb02uence of slavery in national\na\ufb00airs. The state was formed from territory on which the\nSouth had hoped to extend the area of their institution \u2014\nwhich had been won from Mexico for that special purpose;\nand there was no slave state in readiness to be admitted\nwith \nit, \nin \naccordance \nwith \nsouthern \npolicy \nand\ncongressional usage. As an o\ufb00set to this accession to the\npower of the free states, a series of concessions were\nexacted of them which excited great discontent among the\npeople. The compromise measures of , as they were\ncalled, did not satisfy either section. The South did not see\n in them the security they desired, and the North felt itself\nhumiliated and wronged by them. Yet there was among the\npeople of both sections a strong desire for peace. They had\nbecome weary with agitation, and readily fell in with the\naction of the two national conventions, which, in ,\naccepted these measures as a \ufb01nal settlement of the points\nof di\ufb00erence between the two sections of the country. It is\neasy, in looking back, to see how wretched a basis these\nmeasures furnished for peace between freedom and\nslavery; but the best men and the most patriotic men of the\ntime found nothing better.\nHow far Mr. Lincoln shared in the desire that these\nmeasures should be the \ufb01nal settlement of the slavery\nquestion in the country, or believed it possible that they\ncould be, is not known. Although he consented to stand on\nthe Scott electoral ticket in , he does not seem to have\ngone into the canvass with his characteristic earnestness.\nHis party had committed him, in advance, to silence on the\nsubject of slavery; and it was quite possible that he was\nwilling to see how much could be done towards sti\ufb02ing\nwhat seemed to be a fruitless agitation. He made but few\nspeeches, and these few made little impression. The defeat\nof General Scott and the election of General Pierce was in\naccordance with the popular expectation. Mr. Lincoln had\nnot been diverted from his professional pursuits by the\ncampaign, and for two years thereafter he found nothing in\npolitics to call him from his business.\nIn , a new political era opened. Events occurred of\nimmeasurable in\ufb02uence upon the country; and an agitation\n of the slavery question was begun which was destined not\nto \ncease \nuntil \nslavery \nitself \nshould \nbe \ndestroyed.\nDisregarding the pledges of peace and harmony, the party\nin the interest of slavery e\ufb00ected in Congress the\nabrogation of the Missouri Compromise of  \u2014 a\ncompromise which was intended to shut slavery forever out\nof the north-west; and a bill organizing the territories of\nKansas and Nebraska was enacted, which left them free to\nchoose whether they would have slavery as an institution or\nnot. The intention, without doubt, was to force slavery upon\nthose territories \u2014 to make it impossible for them ever to\nbecome free states \u2014 as the subsequent exhibitions of\n\u201cborder ru\ufb00ianism\u201d in Kansas su\ufb00iciently testi\ufb01ed. This\ngreat political iniquity aroused Mr. Lincoln as he had never\nbefore been aroused. It was at this time that he fully\ncomprehended the fact that there was to be no peace on\nthe slavery question until either freedom or slavery should\ntriumph. He knew slavery to be wrong. He had always\nknown and felt it to be so. He knew that he regarded the\ninstitution as the fathers of the republic had regarded it;\nbut a new doctrine had been put forward. Slavery was\nright. Slavery was entitled to equal consideration with\nfreedom. Slavery claimed the privilege of going wherever,\ninto the national domain, it might choose to go. Slavery\nclaimed \nnational \nprotection \neverywhere. \nInstead \nof\nremaining contentedly within the territory it occupied\nunder the protection of the Constitution, it sought to extend\nitself inde\ufb01nitely \u2014 to nationalize itself.\n Judge Douglas of Illinois was the responsible author of\nwhat was called the Kansas-Nebraska bill \u2014 a bill which he\nbased upon what he was pleased to denominate as \u201cpopular\nsovereignty\u201d \u2014 the right of the people of a territory to\nchoose their own institutions; and between Judge Douglas\nand Mr. Lincoln was destined to be fought \u201cthe battle of the\ngiants\u201d on the questions that grew out of this great political\ncrime. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s indignation was an index to the\npopular feeling all over the North. The men who, in good\nfaith, had acquiesced in the compromise measures, though\nwith great reluctance and only for the sake of peace \u2014 who\nhad compelled themselves to silence by biting their lips \u2014\nwho had been forced into silence by their love of the Union\nwhose existence the slave power had threatened \u2014 saw\nthat they had been over-reached and foully wronged.\nMr. Douglas, on his return to his constituents, was met\nby a storm of indignation, so that when he \ufb01rst undertook\nto speak in vindication of himself he was not permitted to\ndo so. He found that he had committed a great political\nblunder, even if he failed to comprehend the fact that he\nhad been guilty of a criminal breach of faith. The \ufb01rst\nexhibitions of popular rage naturally passed away, so that\nthe city which refused to hear him speak, now honors his\ndust as that of a great and powerful and famous man; but\nthe city and the state have discarded his political\nprinciples; and the party which once honored him with so\nmuch con\ufb01dence, remembers with regret \u2014 possibly with\nbitterness \u2014 that he was mainly responsible for its\noverthrow. Mr. Douglas, without doubt, foresaw what was\n coming, as the result of his political misdeeds, but he tried\nto avert the popular judgment. He spoke in various places\nin the state, but with little e\ufb00ect. Congress had adjourned\nearly in August. His attempt to speak in Chicago was made\non the \ufb01rst of September, and early in October, on the\noccasion of the State Fair, he found himself at Spring\ufb01eld.\nThe Fair had brought together a large number of\nrepresentative men, from all parts of the state, many of\nwhom had come for the purposes of political reunion and\nconsultation. There was a great deal of political speaking,\nbut the chief interest of the occasion centered in a\ndiscussion between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Douglas. It had\nbeen many years since these two men had found\nthemselves pitted against each other in debate, and during\nnearly all these years, Mr. Douglas had been in public life.\nHe was a man known to the whole nation. He was the\nrecognized leader of his party in Illinois, notwithstanding\nthe fact that his course had driven many from his support.\nHis experience in debate, his easy audacity and assurance,\nhis great ability, his strong will, his unconquerable\nambition, and his untiring industry, made him a most\nformidable antagonist. To say that his unlimited self-\ncon\ufb01dence, which not unfrequently made him arrogant and\noverbearing \u2014 at least, in appearance \u2014 assisted him in\nthe work which he had before him, would be to insult the\nindependent common sense of the people he addressed. Mr.\nDouglas entered into an exposition and defense of his\nprinciples and policy with the bearing of a man who had\nalready conquered. His long and uninterrupted success had\n made him restive under inquisition, impatient of dispute,\nand de\ufb01ant of opposition.\nOn the day following the speech of Mr. Douglas, Mr.\nLincoln, who had listened to him, replied, and Mr. Douglas\nwas among his auditors. The speech delivered on this\noccasion was one of the most powerful and eloquent e\ufb00orts\nof his life. Mr. Lincoln began by saying that he wished to\npresent nothing to the people but the truth, to which they\nwere certainly entitled, and that, if Judge Douglas should\ndetect him in saying anything untrue, he (Judge Douglas)\nwould correct him. Mr. Douglas took license from this\nremark to interrupt him constantly, with the most\nunimportant questions, and in such a way as to show Mr.\nLincoln that his only motive was to break him down. Finally,\nthe speaker lost his patience, and said, \u201cGentlemen, I\ncannot a\ufb00ord to spend my time in quibbles. I take the\nresponsibility of asserting the truth myself, relieving Judge\nDouglas from the necessity of his impertinent corrections.\u201d\nFrom \nthis \npoint, \nhe \nwas \npermitted \nto \nproceed\nuninterruptedly, until a speech occupying three hours and\nten minutes was concluded. No report of this speech was\nmade, and no judgment can be formed of it, except such as\ncan be made up from the cotemporary newspaper accounts,\nthe recollections of those who heard it, and its e\ufb00ect upon\nthe politics of the state. The enthusiasm of the party press\nwas unbounded, and was manifestly genuine. The Kansas-\nNebraska bill was the subject of debate; and his exposure\nof \nits \nfallacies \nand \niniquities \nwas \ndeclared \nto \nbe\noverwhelming. His whole heart was in his words. The\n Spring\ufb01eld Journal, in describing the speech and the\noccasion, says: \u201cHe quivered with feeling and emotion. The\nwhole house was as still as death. He attacked the bill with\nunusual warmth and energy, and all felt that a man of\nstrength was its enemy, and that he intended to blast it if\nhe could by strong and manly e\ufb00orts. He was most\nsuccessful; and the house approved the glorious triumph of\ntruth by loud and long-continued huzzas. Women waved\ntheir white handkerchiefs in token of woman\u2019s silent but\nheartfelt consent... Mr. Lincoln exhibited Douglas in all the\nattitudes he could be placed in in a friendly debate. He\nexhibited the bill in all its aspects, to show its humbuggery\nand falsehoods, and when thus torn to rags, cut into slips,\nheld up to the gaze of the vast crowd, a kind of scorn was\nvisible upon the face of the crowd and upon the lips of the\nmost eloquent speaker.\u201d The editor, in concluding his\naccount, says: \u201cAt the conclusion of the speech, every man\nfelt that it was unanswerable \u2014 that no human power could\noverthrow it, or trample it under foot. The long and\nrepeated applause evinced the feelings of the crowd, and\ngave token of universal assent to Lincoln\u2019s whole\nargument; and every mind present did homage to the man\nwho took captive the heart, and broke like a sun over the\nunderstanding.\u201d\nThe account of this speech in the Chicago Press and\nTribune was not less enthusiastic in its praise, than the\njournal just quoted: After stating that, within the limit of a\nnewspaper article, it would be impossible to give an idea of\nthe strength of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s argument, and that it was by\n far the ablest e\ufb00ort of the campaign, he quotes the\nfollowing passage directly from the speech, as remarkable\nin its power upon the audience: \u201cMy distinguished friend\nsays it is an insult to the emigrants to Kansas and Nebraska\nto suppose they are not able to govern themselves. We\nmust not slur over an argument of this kind because it\nhappens to tickle the ear. It must be met and answered. I\nadmit that the emigrant to Kansas and Nebraska is\ncompetent to govern himself, but (the speaker rising to his\nfull hight,) I deny his right to govern any other person\nwithout that person\u2019s consent.\u201d That touched the very\nmarrow of the matter, and revealed the whole di\ufb00erence\nbetween him and Douglas. The crowd understood it. They\nsaw through the iniquity of \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d and the\nKansas-Nebraska bill, and the applause which followed\nshowed \ntheir \nappreciation \nof \nthe \nclearness \nand\nthoroughness with which the speaker had exposed it.\nWhen Mr. Lincoln concluded his speech, Mr. Douglas\nhastily took the stand, and said that he had been abused,\n\u201cthough in a perfectly courteous manner.\u201d He spoke until\nthe adjournment Of the meeting for supper, but touched\nonly slightly upon the great questions which Mr. Lincoln\nhad handled with so much power. That he felt his e\ufb00ort to\nbe a failure, is evident from subsequent events soon to be\nrecounted. Before closing, he insisted on his right to\nresume his speech in the evening, but when evening came\nhe did not resume, and did not choose to resume. The\nspeech was never concluded.\n The next meeting between the two party champions took\nplace at Peoria, though not by pre-arrangement. Mr.\nLincoln followed Mr. Douglas to Peoria, and challenged him\nthere, as he had done at Spring\ufb01eld. At Peoria, Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s triumph was even more marked than at\nSpring\ufb01eld, for his antagonist had lost something of his\nassurance. He was a wounded and weakened man, indeed.\nHe had become conscious that he was not invulnerable. He\nhad been a witness of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s power over the people;\nand it is quite possible that his faith in his own position had\nbeen shaken. It was noticed at Peoria that his manner was\nmuch modi\ufb01ed, and that he betrayed a lack of con\ufb01dence in\nhimself, not at all usual with him. Here, as at Spring\ufb01eld,\nMr. Lincoln occupied more than three hours in the delivery\nof his speech, and it came down upon Mr. Douglas so\ncrushingly that the doughty debater did not even undertake\nto reply to it.\nIt is to be remembered that Mr. Lincoln, in his political\nspeeches, resorted to none of the tricks common among\nwhat are called stump speakers. He was thoroughly in\nearnest and always closely argumentative. If he told\nstories, it was not to amuse a crowd, but to illustrate a\npoint. The real questions at issue engaged his entire\nattention, and he never undertook to raise a false issue or\nto dodge a real one. Indeed, he seemed incapable of the\ntricks so often resorted to for the discom\ufb01ture of an\nopponent. Fortunately, the Peoria speech was reported, and\nwe have an opportunity of forming an intelligent judgment\nof its character and its power. One passage will su\ufb00ice to\n illustrate both. Mr. Douglas had urged that the people of\nIllinois had no interest in the question of slavery in the\nterritories \u2014 that it concerned only the people of the\nterritories. This was in accordance with his own feeling,\nwhen he declared that he did not care whether slavery was\n\u201cvoted up or voted down\u201d in Kansas. Mr. Lincoln opposed\nthis on the broad ground of humanity and the terms of the\ndeclaration of independence; but to bring the matter more\ndirectly home, and to show that the people of Illinois had a\npractical interest in the question of slavery in the\nterritories, he said:\n\u201cBy the Constitution, each state has two senators \u2014 each\nhas a number of representatives in proportion to the\nnumber of its people, and each has a number of\npresidential electors, equal to the whole number of its\nrepresentatives and senators together. But in ascertaining\nthe number of the people for the purpose, \ufb01ve slaves are\ncounted as being equal to three whites. The slaves do not\nvote; they are only counted, and so used as to swell the\nin\ufb02uence of the white people\u2019s votes. The practical e\ufb00ect of\nthis is more aptly shown by a comparison of the states of\nSouth Carolina and Maine. South Carolina has six\nrepresentatives and so has Maine; South Carolina has eight\npresidential electors and so has Maine. This is precise\nequality so far; and of course they are equal in senators,\neach having two. Thus, in the control of the government,\nthey are equals precisely. But how are they in the number\nof their white people? Maine has ,, while South\nCarolina has ,. Maine has twice as many as South\n Carolina, and , over. Thus each white man in South\nCarolina is more than the double of any man in Maine. This\nis all because South Carolina, besides her free people, has\n, slaves. The South Carolinian has precisely the\nsame advantage over the white man in every other free\nstate as well as in Maine. He is more than the double of any\none of us. The same advantage, but not to the same extent,\nis held by all the citizens of the slave states over those of\nthe free; and it is an absolute truth, without an exception,\nthat there is no voter in any slave state but who has more\nlegal power in the government than any voter in any free\nstate. There is no instance of exact equality; and the\ndisadvantage is against us the whole chapter through. This\nprinciple, in the aggregate, gives the slave states in the\npresent Congress twenty additional representatives \u2014\nbeing seven more than the whole majority by which they\npassed the Nebraska bill.\n\u201cNow all this is manifestly unfair; yet I do not mention it\nto complain of it, in so far as it is already settled. It is in the\nConstitution, and I do not for that cause, or any other\ncause, propose to destroy, or alter, or disregard the\nConstitution. I stand to it fairly, fully and \ufb01rmly. But when I\nam told that I must leave it altogether to other people to\nsay whether new partners are to be bred up and brought\ninto the \ufb01rm, on the same degrading terms against me, I\nrespectfully demur. I insist that whether I shall be a whole\nman or only the half of one in comparison with others is a\nquestion in which I am somewhat concerned; and one\nwhich no other man can have a sacred right of deciding for\n me. If I am wrong in this \u2014 if it really be a sacred right of\nself-government in the man who shall go to Nebraska to\ndecide whether he will be the equal of me or the double of\nme, then, after he shall have exercised that right, and\nthereby shall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of\na man than I already am, I should like for some gentleman\ndeeply skilled in the mystery of \u2018sacred rights,\u2019 to provide\nhimself with a microscope, and peep about and \ufb01nd out it\nhe can what has become of my \u2018sacred rights.\u2019 They will\nsurely be too small for detection by the naked eye.\n\u201cFinally, I insist that if there is anything that it is the duty\nof the whole people to never intrust to any hands but their\nown, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of their\nown liberties and institutions. And if they shall think, as I\ndo, that the extension of slavery endangers them more than\nany or all other causes, how recreant to themselves if they\nsubmit the question, and with it, the fate of their country, to\na mere handful of men bent only on temporary self-\ninterest!\u201d\nMr. Douglas might well excuse himself from any attempt\nto answer this argument, or escape from its inevitable\nlogic, for it was unanswerable.\nIt was naturally the wish of Mr. Lincoln to continue these\ndiscussions in other parts of the state. He felt that a\nrevolution of public opinion was in progress \u2014 that parties\nwere breaking up, and that he had his opponent at a\ndisadvantage. But Mr. Douglas had had enough for this\ntime. He wished to withdraw his forces before they were\ndestroyed. He had had a heavy skirmish, and been worsted.\n He shrank from a continuance of the \ufb01ght. The great and\ndecisive battle was to come.\nAt the close of the debate, the two combatants held a\nconference, the result of which has been variously\nreported. One authority states that Mr. Douglas sent for Mr.\nLincoln, and told him that if he would speak no more during\nthe campaign, he (Douglas) would go home and remain\nsilent during the same period, and that this arrangement\nwas agreed upon and its terms ful\ufb01lled. That there was a\nconference on the subject sought by Mr. Douglas, there is\nno doubt; and there is no doubt that Mr. Lincoln promised\nnot to challenge him again to debate during the canvass,\nbut abundant evidence exists that Mr. Lincoln did not leave\nthe \ufb01eld at all, but spoke in various parts of the state.\nOwing very materially to Mr. Lincoln\u2019s e\ufb00orts, a political\nrevolution swept the state. The old stronghold of the\ndemocratic party fell before the onslaughts made upon it,\nand, for the \ufb01rst time since the democratic party was\norganized, the legislature of Illinois was in the hands of the\nopposition. Politics were in a transitional, not to say chaotic\nstate. The opposition was made up of whigs, Americans,\nand anti-Nebraska democrats. Among the men elected was\nMr. Lincoln himself, who had been put in nomination while\nabsent, by his friends in the county. As has already been\nstated, he resigned before taking his seat. His election was\ne\ufb00ected without consultation with him, and entirely against\nhis wishes.\nThe excitement attending the election of this legislature\ndid not die out with the election, for the new body had the\n responsibility of electing a United States senator. The old\nwhigs elected had not relinquished the hope that, by some\nmeans, their party, which had in reality been broken up by\nthe southern whigs in Congress going over to the\ndemocrats on the vote for the repeal of the Missouri\nCompromise, would again be united, while the anti-\nNebraska democrats declined to go over to the whigs,\nsupposing that, by clinging together, they could force the\nregular democracy of the state to come upon their ground.\nHere were two strongly antagonistic interests that were in\nsome way to be harmonized, in order to beat the nominee\nof the great body of the democrats who still acknowledged\nthe lead of Judge Douglas. The anti-Nebraska democrats\nrefused to go into a nominating caucus with the whigs, and\nthree candidates were placed in the \ufb01eld. Mr. Lincoln was\nthe nominee of the whigs, Lyman Trumbull of the anti-\nNebraska democrats, and General James Shields of the\ndemocrats of the Douglas school. After a number of\nundecisive ballots in the legislature, the democrats having\ndropped their candidate and adopted Governor Joel A.\nMatteson \u2014 a gentleman who had not committed himself to\neither side of the great question \u2014 it became possible for\nthe supporters of Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Trumbull to elect one\nof those gentlemen, by a union of their forces. That Mr.\nLincoln was ambitious for the honors of this high o\ufb00ice\nthere is no question, but he had seen Governor Matteson\ncome within three votes of an election, and perceived that\nthere was actual danger of his triumph. At this juncture, he\nbegged his friends to leave him, and go for Mr. Trumbull.\n They yielded to his urgent entreaties, though it is said that\nstrong men among them actually wept when they\nconsented to do so. The consequence was the election of\nMr. Trumbull, to the great astonishment of the democrats,\nwho did not believe it possible for the opposition to unite.\nTheir triumph was due simply to the magnanimity of Mr.\nLincoln and his devotion to principle. He had no reproaches\nfor those anti-Nebraska democrats who had refused to go\nfor him, although his arguments had done more than those\nof any other man to give them their power, and he cared far\nmore for the triumph of political truth and honor than for\nhis own elevation. Mr. Lincoln never had reason to regret\nhis self-sacri\ufb01ce, for, upon the organization of the\nrepublican \nparty, \nall \nthe \nopposition \nparties \nfound\nthemselves together, and Mr. Lincoln became their\nforemost man.\n",
    "1854-1861": "   ha ter  II.\nONE OF THE most remarkable passages in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nhistory was his contest with Senator Douglas, in , for\nthe seat in the United States Senate which was soon to be\nvacated by the expiration of the term for which the latter\nwas elected. Frequent allusion has been made to this\nalready; but before proceeding to its description something\nfurther should be said of Mr. Douglas himself.\nMr. Douglas was but little more than twenty years of age\nwhen, in , he entered Illinois. He was poor \u2014\npenniless, indeed. The \ufb01rst money he earned in the state\nwas as the clerk of an auction sale. His next essay was in\nteaching school. He began to practice law during the\nsecond year, and at the age of twenty-two was elected\nAttorney General of the state. He resigned this o\ufb00ice in\n, and was elected a member of the legislature. It was\nhere that he and Abraham Lincoln met for the \ufb01rst time. In\n, before he was twenty-\ufb01ve years old, he received the\ndemocratic nomination for Congress, and was only beaten\nby a majority of \ufb01ve votes. In , he was appointed\nsecretary of the state of Illinois, and in  he was elected\nto Congress, and re-elected in  and . Before he\ntook his seat under the last election, he was elected to the\nUnited States Senate; and his second term of service in this\n august body was about expiring at the present point of this\nhistory.\nThe career of Mr. Douglas had been one of almost\nuninterrupted political success. He was the recognized\nleader of the democratic party of Illinois, and had been\nknown and felt as a positive power in national legislation.\nHe had very decided opinions upon all the great questions\npassed upon by Congress, and, though not unfrequently at\nvariance with the administrations he had himself assisted\nto place in power, his in\ufb02uence was great in whatever\ndirection he might choose to exert it. He accomplished\nmuch in establishing and nourishing the prosperity of\nIllinois. No man did so much as Mr. Douglas for securing\nthose magni\ufb01cent grants of land which contributed to the\ndevelopment of his adopted state. To the material interests\nof Illinois, and the preservation of the power of the\ndemocratic party in that state, he was thoroughly devoted;\nand that party honored him with its entire con\ufb01dence and\nalmost unquestioning support. He was their \ufb01rst man; and\nthey bestowed upon him, during his life, more honor than\nthey ever gave to any other man living on their territory.\nMr. Lincoln had watched this man, with admiration for\nhis tact and respect for his power with the people. He had\nseen him winning the highest honors in their gift, and, if he\ndid not envy him, it was not because he was not ambitious.\nIt was because nothing so mean as envy could have place in\nhim. That he regarded Mr. Douglas as an unscrupulous man\nin the use of means for securing his ambitious ends, there\nis no doubt; and although he would have refused honor and\n o\ufb00ice on the terms on which Mr. Douglas received them, he\nwas much impressed by the dignities with which the\nSenator was invested, and felt that the power he held was a\nprecious, aye, a priceless, possession.\nFrom the original manuscript of one of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nspeeches, these words are transferred to this biography:\n\u201cTwenty-two years ago, Judge Douglas and I \ufb01rst became\nacquainted. We were both young then \u2014 he a tri\ufb02e younger\nthan I. Even then we were both ambitious, \u2014 I, perhaps,\nquite as much so as he. With me, the race of ambition has\nbeen a failure \u2014 a \ufb02at failure; with him, it has been one of\nsplendid success. His name \ufb01lls the nation, and is not\nunknown even in foreign lands. I a\ufb00ect no contempt for the\nhigh eminence he has reached. So reached that the\noppressed of my species might have shared with me in the\nelevation, I would rather stand on that eminence than wear\nthe richest crown that ever pressed a monarch\u2019s brow.\u201d\nThis extract touches the points of similarity between the\ntwo men, and their points of di\ufb00erence. Mr. Lincoln was far\nfrom insensible to the honors of Mr. Douglas\u2019 position; but\nhe would not have them at the price Mr. Douglas had paid\nfor them. The oppressed of his species had not shared with\nMr. Douglas in his elevation. The slave had had none of his\nconsideration; and he was in league with the slave\u2019s\noppressor. It would not have been pleasant to Mr. Lincoln\nto wear the honors of Mr. Douglas, if, with them, he had\nbeen obliged to carry the responsibility of extending or\ngiving latitude and lease to an institution which made\nchattels of men. Mr. Douglas looked upon slavery either\n with indi\ufb00erence or approval. He had publicly said that he\ndid not care whether slavery was \u201cvoted up or voted down\u201d\nin the territories. Mr. Lincoln regarded slavery as a great\nmoral, social and political wrong. Here was the vital\ndi\ufb00erence between the two, recognized as such by Mr.\nLincoln himself.\nAfter the adoption of the Lecompton Constitution in\nKansas, Mr. Douglas having foreseen its character, and\nhaving virtually committed himself to it in advance \u2014\nhaving, indeed, undertaken to make the republican party\nmorally responsible for its existence and adoption, a\nchange seems to have come over his opinions. Before he\ndeparted for Washington, to attend the session of  and\n, it was whispered that he was about to break with the\nadministration on the Lecompton business. It is always\npleasant to give men credit for the best motives; and those\nunder which he acted may have been the best. To oppose\nthat constitution was certainly not inconsistent with his pet\ndoctrine \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d when taken by itself, for\nnothing was more easily demonstrable than the fact that\nthat constitution was not the act and deed of the people of\nKansas \u2014 that it was in no sense an expression of their will.\nWhile this is true, it is proper to remember that Mr.\nDouglas was shrewd enough to see that he could not carry\nthe burden of the Lecompton Constitution through the\ncanvass for the senatorial prize, then imminent. The\noutrage was too \ufb02agrant to be ignored, and the facts too\nnotorious to be disputed. He was also shrewd enough to\nsee that his opposition to the Lecompton fraud would take\n from the republican party some of its best capital, and\ngreatly distract the opposition in their e\ufb00orts to defeat him.\nDuring that session of Congress Mr. Douglas fought a\ngallant and manly \ufb01ght against the administration on the\nLecompton question, and, on that question, voted and\nlabored with the republicans. It was a bold step. Without\nMr. Douglas, it is easy to see that the Lecompton\nConstitution would have been impossible. He voluntarily\nthrew open the territory to this outrage. Then he tried to\nkill his own legitimate child. He forsook the men whom he\nhad led into the great iniquity. The republicans were\ngrateful for his aid, and were naturally drawn to him in\nsympathy because, for his e\ufb00orts on behalf of justice in\nKansas, he had incurred the enmity of Mr. Buchanan, who\nwas regarded as a most willing tool in the hands of the\nslave power.\nThe democratic state convention of Illinois assembled on\nthe st of April, , and endorsed Mr. Douglas in his\nposition as an anti-Lecompton man. They placed a state\nticket in the \ufb01eld, and engineered the canvass with such\nskill and vigor that the administration, through its o\ufb00ice-\nholders, could make no headway against them. The power\nof Mr. Douglas over the politicians and masses in his own\nstate, was never better illustrated than during this\ncampaign, \nwhen \nall \nthe \npatronage \nof \nthe \nfederal\ngovernment could do nothing to defeat him. Before the\nclose of the session, Mr. Douglas went home to look after\nhis interests, and to prepare for the great campaign of his\nlife.\n A large number of republicans in the eastern states who\nhad not known Mr. Douglas at home, and who had\nwitnessed his bold and gallant \ufb01ght with the administration\nand the slave-power in the senate, expressed the wish that\ntheir friends in Illinois might \ufb01nd it in the line of their duty\nto aid in returning him to the senate. The republicans of\nIllinois, however, felt that they knew the man better, and\nthat their duty did not lie in that direction at all. They\nurged that Mr. Douglas did not agree with them in a single\npoint of doctrine \u2014 that he had di\ufb00ered with the\nadministration merely on a question of fact, whether the\nLecompton Constitution was the act and deed of the people\nof Kansas. They averred that he adhered to the outrageous\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case \u2014\nthat a negro cannot sue in a United States court, and that\nCongress cannot prohibit slavery in the territories \u2014 and\nthat they dared not trust Mr. Douglas. To this it was replied\nthat Mr. Douglas was coming over to the republican party\nas fast as he could carry his followers with him, and that\nhis extraordinary hold upon the masses of the democratic\nparty at the North would enable him to bring to the\nrepublican ranks a reinforcement which would prove\nirresistible at the approaching presidential election. The\nrejoinder of the Illinois republicans was that the probability\nof any sincere change of faith in Mr. Douglas was too\nremote and uncertain to warrant them in abandoning an\norganization which had been formed to advance a great\nand just cause, and Which, once dissolved, could not be re-\nformed in time to render e\ufb00icient service in the election of\n . Quite a controversy grew out of the di\ufb00erences\nbetween the Illinois republicans and their eastern advisers,\nand no small degree of bitterness was engendered. The\nparty in Illinois was nearly a unit in its views, but the\ncontroversy had undoubtedly the in\ufb02uence to loosen the\nhold of the organization upon some of its members. The\ne\ufb00ect was temporary, however, for the issues of the\ncampaign \nwere \nso \nthoroughly \ndiscussed, \nand \nthe\ndiscussions themselves were so generally listened to, or\nread in the journals of the day, that it is doubtful whether\nMr. Douglas gained any appreciable advantage from the\ncontroversy, or the sympathy of republicans in other states.\nThe republican state convention met at Spring\ufb01eld on\nthe sixteenth of June, nearly two months after the\nassembling of the democratic convention. Aside from the\nsenatorial question, there was but little interest in the\nproceedings. For state o\ufb00icers, only a treasurer and a\nsuperintendent of public instruction were to be nominated,\nand, besides these o\ufb00icers, only the members of a\nlegislature were to be elected. Nearly six hundred\ndelegates were present in the convention, and they, with\ntheir alternates, completed a round thousand of earnest\nmen, gathered from all parts of the state. The \ufb01fth\nresolution adopted on this occasion covers the grand issue\nmade with Judge Douglas.\n\u201cThat while we deprecate all interference on the part of\npolitical organizations with the judiciary, if such action is\nlimited to its appropriate sphere, yet we cannot refrain\nfrom expressing our condemnation of the principles and\n tendencies of the extra-judicial opinions of a majority of the\nJudges of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the\nmatter of Dred Scott, wherein the political heresy is put\nforth that the federal constitution extends slavery into all\nthe territories of the Republic, and so maintains it that\nneither Congress nor the people through the territorial\nlegislature can by law abolish it. We hold that Congress\npossesses sovereign power over the territories, and has the\nright to govern and control them whilst they remain in a\nterritorial condition, and that it is the duty of the general\ngovernment to protect the territories from the curse of\nslavery, and to preserve the public domain for the\noccupation of free men and free labor; and we declare that\nno power on earth can carry and maintain slavery in the\nstates against the will of their people and the provisions of\ntheir constitutions and laws; and we fully indorse the\nrecent decision of the Supreme Court of our own state,\nwhich declares that property in persons is repugnant to the\nConstitution and laws of Illinois, and that all persons within\nits jurisdiction are presumed to be free, and that slavery,\nwhere it exists, is a municipal regulation, without any\nextra-territorial operation.\u201d\nIf there were men in the convention who had at \ufb01rst been\na\ufb00ected by the representations of the republicans in the\neastern states, the action of the democratic convention\nwhich met in April had restored their determination to\nstand by their party and its candidates. That convention\nhad denounced the republicans, had indorsed the old\ndemocratic platform of the party adopted at Cincinnati in\n national convention, and, while it approved the course of\nSenator Douglas, failed to say one word in condemnation of\nthe course and principles, or, rather, lack of principles, of\nMr. Buchanan and his administration. The republican\nconvention had hardly assembled before it was discovered\nthat there was entire unanimity for Mr. Lincoln, as their\nnominee in opposition to Mr. Douglas. When a banner from\nChicago was borne into the convention, inscribed with the\nwords\u2014 \u201cCook County for Abraham Lincoln\u201d \u2014 the whole\nconvention rose to its feet, and gave three cheers for the\ncandidate whom it was proposed to place in the \ufb01eld in\nopposition to the champion of \u201cpopular sovereignty.\u201d That\nthe convention was embarrassed and doubtful as to results,\nthere is no question. Mr. Douglas had the sympathy of\nmany republicans abroad, he had attacked a hated\nadministration with great vigor and persistence, he had the\nenmity of that administration, and, in the state, he had the\nadvantage of an unjust apportionment of legislative\ndistricts, by which not less than ninety-three thousand\npeople were virtually disfranchised. Though it was not\naccording to the wish of many of the members of the\nconvention to make a formal nomination for the senate, yet,\nas Mr. Douglas had already declared that it was the\nintention to use Mr. Lincoln\u2019s name during the canvass, and\nto adopt another name in the legislature, the following\nresolution was brought forward, and unanimously adopted:\n\u201cThat Hon. Abraham Lincoln is our \ufb01rst and only choice\nfor United States Senator, to \ufb01ll the vacancy about to be\ncreated by the expiration of Mr. Douglas\u2019 term of o\ufb00ice.\u201d\n The anxiety of the convention to see and hear their\nchosen man and champion was intense; and frequent calls\nwere made for him during the day. That Mr. Lincoln\nexpected the nomination, and had prepared himself for it,\nis evident. It was announced at length that he would\naddress the members of the convention at the State House\nin the evening. During the day, he was busy in giving the\n\ufb01nishing touches to his speech, which had been prepared\nwith unusual care, every sentence having been carefully\nweighed. He had put into it what he believed to be the real\nissues of the campaign, and had laid out in it the ground\nupon which he proposed to stand, and \ufb01ght his battles.\nBefore going to the hall, he entered his law o\ufb00ice, where\nMr. Herndon, his partner, was sitting, and turned the key\nagainst all intrusion. Taking out his manuscript, he read to\nMr. Herndon the \ufb01rst paragraph of his speech, and asked\nhim for his opinion of it. Mr. Herndon replied that it was all\ntrue, but he doubted whether it was good policy to give it\nutterance at that time. \u201cThat makes no di\ufb00erence,\u201d\nresponded Mr. Lincoln. \u201cIt is the truth, and the nation is\nentitled to it.\u201d Then, alluding to a quotation which he had\nmade from the Bible\u2014 \u201cA house divided against itself\ncannot stand,\u201d he said that he wished to give an illustration\nfamiliar to all, \u201cthat he who reads may run.\u201d \u201cThe\nproposition is true,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln, \u201cand has been true\nfor six thousand years, and I will deliver it as it is written.\u201d\nAt eight o\u2019clock, the hall of the House of Representatives\nwas \ufb01lled to its utmost capacity, and when Mr. Lincoln\nappeared he was received with the most tumultuous\n applause. The speech which he made on that occasion is so\nfull of meaning, so fraught with prophecy, so keen in its\nanalysis, so irresistible in its logic, so profoundly intelligent\nconcerning the politics of the time, and, withal, so\ncondensed in the expression of every part, that no proper\nidea can be given of it through any description or\nabbreviation. It must be given entire.\nMr. Lincoln said:\n\u201cIf We could \ufb01rst know where we are, and whither we are\ntending. we could better judge what to do, and how to do it.\nWe are now far into the \ufb01fth year, since a policy was\ninitiated with the avowed object and con\ufb01dent promise of\nputting an end to slavery agitation. Under the operation of\nthat policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has\nconstantly augmented. In my opinion, it will not cease, until\na crisis shall have been reached and passed. \u2018A house\ndivided \nagainst \nitself \ncannot \nstand.\u2019 \nI \nbelieve \nthis\ngovernment cannot endure permanently half slave and half\nfree. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved \u2014 I do not\nexpect the house to fall \u2014 but I do expect it will cease to be\ndivided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either\nthe opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it,\nand place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief\nthat it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or its\nadvocates will push it forward, till it shall become alike\nlawful in all the states, old as well as new \u2014 North as well\nas South.\n\u201cHave we no tendency to the latter condition?\n \u201cLet any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now\nalmost complete legal combination-piece of machinery, so\nto speak \u2014 compounded of the Nebraska doctrine, and the\nDred Scott decision. Let him consider not only what work\nthe machinery is adapted to do, and how well adapted; but\nalso, let him study the history of its construction, and trace,\nif he can, or rather fail, if he can, to trace the evidences of\ndesign, and concert of action among its chief architects,\nfrom the beginning.\n\u201cThe new year of  found slavery excluded from more\nthan half the states by State Constitutions, and from most\nof the national territory by Congressional prohibition. Four\ndays later, commenced the struggle which ended in\nrepealing that Congressional prohibition. This opened all\nthe national territory to slavery, and was the \ufb01rst point\ngained.\n\u201cBut, \nso \nfar, \nCongress \nonly \nhad \nacted; \nand \nan\nindorsement by the people, real or apparent, was\nindispensable, to save the point already gained, and give\nchance for more.\n\u201cThis necessity had not been overlooked; but had been\nprovided for, as well as might be, in the notable argument\nof \u2018squatter sovereignty,\u2019 otherwise called \u2018sacred right of\nself-government,\u2019 which latter phrase, though expressive of\nthe only rightful basis of any government, was so perverted\nin this attempted use of it as to amount to just this: That if\nany one man choose to enslave another, no third man shall\nbe allowed to object. That argument was incorporated into\nthe Nebraska bill itself, in the language which follows: \u2018It\n being the true intent and meaning of this act not to\nlegislate slavery into any territory or state, nor to exclude it\ntherefrom; but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to\nform and regulate their domestic institutions in their own\nway, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\u2019\nThen opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of\n\u2018squatter \nsovereignty,\u2019 \nand \n\u2018sacred \nright \nof \nself-\ngovernment.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 said opposition members, \u2018let us amend\nthe bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the\nterritory may exclude slavery.\u2019 \u2018Not we,\u2019 said the friends of\nthe measure; and down they voted the amendment.\n\u201cWhile the Nebraska bill was passing through Congress,\na law case involving the question of a negro\u2019s freedom, by\nreason of his owner having voluntarily taken him \ufb01rst into a\nfree state and then into a territory covered by the\nCongressional prohibition, and held him as a slave for a\nlong time in each, was passing through the United States\nCircuit Court for the District of Missouri; and both\nNebraska bill and lawsuit Were brought to a decision in the\nsame month of May, . The negro\u2019s name was \u2018Dred\nScott,\u2019 which name now designates the decision \ufb01nally\nmade in the case. Before the then next presidential\nelection, the law case came to, and was argued in the\nSupreme Court of the United States: but the decision of it\nwas deferred until after the election. Still, before the\nelection. Senator Trumbull, on the \ufb02oor of the Senate,\nrequested the leading advocate of the Nebraska bill to state\nhis opinion whether the people of a territory can\n constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits; and the\nlatter answers, \u201cThat is a question for the Supreme Court.\u2019\n\u201cThe election came. Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the\nindorsement, such as it was, secured. That was the second\npoint gained. The indorsement, however, fell short of a\nclear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand\nvotes, and so, perhaps. was not overwhelmingly reliable\nand satisfactory. The outgoing President, in his last annual\nmessage, as impressively as possible echoed back upon the\npeople the weight and authority of the indorsement. The\nSupreme Court met again; did not announce their decision,\nbut ordered a re-argument. The presidential inauguration\ncame, and still no decision of the court; but the incoming\npresident in his inaugural address fervently exhorted the\npeople to abide by the forthcoming decision, whatever it\nmight be. Then, in a few days, came the decision.\n\u201cThe reputed author of the Nebraska bill \ufb01nds an early\noccasion to make a speech at this capital indorsing the\nDred Scott decision, and vehemently denouncing all\nopposition to it. The new president, too, seizes the early\noccasion of the Silliman letter to indorse and strongly\nconstrue that decision, and to express his astonishment\nthat any di\ufb00erent view had ever been entertained!\n\u201cAt length a squabble springs up between the president\nand the author of the Nebraska bill, on the mere question\nof fact, whether the Lecompton Constitution was or was\nnot, in any just sense, made by the people of Kansas; and in\nthat quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a fair\nvote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery\n be voted down or voted up. I do not understand his\ndeclaration that he cares not whether slavery be voted\ndown or voted up to be intended by him other than as an\napt de\ufb01nition of the policy he would impress upon the\npublic mind \u2014 the principle for which he declares he has\nsu\ufb00ered so much, and is ready to su\ufb00er to the end. And\nwell may he cling to that principle. If he has any parental\nfeeling, well may he cling to it. That principle is the only\nshred left of his original Nebraska doctrine. Under the\nDred Scott decision squatter sovereignty squatted out of\nexistence, tumbled down like temporary sca\ufb00olding \u2014 like\nthe mould at the foundry, served through one blast and fell\nback into loose sand \u2014 helped to carry an election, and\nthen was kicked to the winds. His late joint struggle with\nthe republicans, against the Lecompton Constitution,\ninvolves nothing of the original Nebraska doctrine. That\nstruggle was made on a point \u2014 the right of a people to\nmake their own constitution \u2014 upon which he and the\nrepublicans have never di\ufb00ered.\n\u201cThe several points of the Dred Scott decision, in\nconnection with Senator Douglas\u2019 \u2018care not\u2019 policy,\nconstitute the piece of machinery, in its present state of\nadvancement. This was the third point gained. The working\npoints of that machinery are:\n\u201cFirst, That no negro slave, imported as such from Africa,\nand no descendant of such slave, can ever be a citizen of\nany state, in the sense of that term as used in the\nConstitution of the United States. This point is made in\norder to deprive the negro, in every possible event, of the\n bene\ufb01t of that provision of the United States Constitution,\nwhich declares that \u2018The citizens of each state shall be\nentitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the\nseveral states.\u2019\n\u201cSecondly, That \u2018subject to the Constitution of the United\nStates,\u2019 neither Congress nor a territorial legislature can\nexclude slavery from any United States territory. This point\nis made in order that individual men may \ufb01ll up the\nterritories with slaves, without danger of losing them as\nproperty, and thus to enhance the chances of permanency\nto the institution through all the future.\n\u201cThirdly, That whether the holding a negro in actual\nslavery in a free state, makes him free, as against the\nholder, the United States courts will not decide, but will\nleave to be decided by the courts of any slave state the\nnegro may be forced into by the master. This point is made,\nnot to be pressed immediately; but, if acquiesced in for\nawhile, and apparently indorsed by the people at an\nelection, then to sustain the logical conclusion that what\nDred Scott\u2019s master might lawfully do with Dred Scott, in\nthe free state of Illinois, every other master may lawfully do\nwith any other one, or one thousand slaves, in Illinois, or in\nany other free state.\n\u201cAuxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it,\nthe Nebraska doctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate\nand mould public opinion, at least northern public opinion,\nnot to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up. This\nshows exactly where we now are; and partially, also,\nwhither we are tending.\n \u201cIt will throw additional light on the latter, to go back,\nand run the mind over the string of historical facts already\nstated. Several things will now appear less dark and\nmysterious than they did when they were transpiring. The\npeople were to be left \u2018perfectly free,\u2019 \u2018subject only to the\nConstitution.\u2019 What the Constitution had to do with it,\noutsiders could not then see. Plainly enough now, it was an\nexactly \ufb01tted niche, for the Dred Scott decision to\nafterward come in, and declare the perfect freedom of the\npeople to be just no freedom at all. Why was the\namendment, expressly declaring the right of the people,\nvoted down? Plainly enough now: the adoption of it would\nhave spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision. Why\nwas the court decision held up? Why even a senator\u2019s\nindividual opinion withheld, till after the presidential\nelection? Plainly enough now: the speaking out then would\nhave damaged the perfectly free argument upon which the\nelection was to be carried. Why the out-going president\u2019s\nfelicitation on the indorsement? Why the delay of a re-\nargument? \nWhy \nthe \nincoming \npresident\u2019s \nadvance\nexhortation in favor of the decision? These things look like\nthe cautious patting and petting of a spirited horse\npreparatory to mounting him, when it is dreaded that he\nmay give the rider a fall. And why the hasty after-\nindorsement of the decision by the president and others?\n\u201cWe cannot absolutely know that all these exact\nadaptations are the result of preconcert. But when we see a\nlot of framed timbers, di\ufb00erent portions of which we know\nhave been gotten out at di\ufb00erent times and places and by\n di\ufb00erent workmen \u2014 Stephen, Franklin, Roger and James,\nfor instance \u2014 and when we see these timbers joined\ntogether, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or\na mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly \ufb01tting, and all\nthe lengths and proportions of the di\ufb00erent pieces exactly\nadapted to their respective places, and not a piece too\nmany or too few \u2014 not omitting even sca\ufb00olding \u2014 or, if a\nsingle piece be lacking, we see the place in the frame\nexactly \ufb01tted and prepared yet to bring such piece in \u2014 in\nsuch a case, we \ufb01nd it impossible not to believe that\nStephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood\none another from the beginning, and all worked upon a\ncommon plan or draft drawn up before the \ufb01rst blow was\nstruck.\n\u201cIt should not be overlooked that, by the Nebraska bill,\nthe people of a state as well as territory, were to be left\n\u2018perfectly free,\u2019 \u2018subject only to the Constitution.\u2019 Why\nmention a state? They were legislating for territories, and\nnot for or about states. Certainly the people of a state are\nand ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United\nStates; but why is mention of this lugged into this merely\nterritorial law? Why are the people of a territory and the\npeople of a state therein lumped together, and their\nrelation to the Constitution therein treated as being\nprecisely the same? While the opinion of the court, by Chief\nJustice Taney, in the Dred Scott case, and the separate\nopinions of all the concurring judges, expressly declare that\nthe Constitution of the United States neither permits\nCongress nor a territorial legislature to exclude slavery\n from any United States territory, they all omit to declare\nwhether or not the same Constitution permits a state, or\nthe people of a state, to exclude it. Possibly, this is a mere\nomission; but who can be quite sure, if McLean or Curtis\nhad sought to get into the opinion a declaration of\nunlimited power in the people of a state to exclude slavery\nfrom their limits, just as Chase and Mace sought to get\nsuch declaration, in behalf of the people of a territory, into\nthe Nebraska bill; \u2014 I ask, who can be quite sure that it\nwould not have been voted down in the one case as it had\nbeen in the other? The nearest approach to the point of\ndeclaring the power of a state over slavery, is made by\nJudge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, using the\nprecise idea, and almost the language, too, of the Nebraska\nact. On one occasion, his exact language is, \u2018except in cases\nwhere the power is restrained by the Constitution of the\nUnited States, the law of the state is supreme over the\nsubject of slavery within its jurisdiction.\u2019 In what cases the\npower of the states is so restrained by the United States\nConstitution, is left an open question, precisely as the same\nquestion as to the restraint on the power of the territories\nwas left open in the Nebraska act. Put this and that\ntogether, and we have another nice little niche, which we\nmay, ere long, see \ufb01lled with another Supreme Court\ndecision, declaring that the Constitution of the United\nStates does not permit a state to exclude slavery from its\nlimits. And this may especially be expected if the doctrine\nof \u2018care not whether slavery be voted down or voted up,\u2019\n shall gain upon the public mind su\ufb00iciently to give promise\nthat such a decision can be maintained when made.\n\u201cSuch a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being\nalike lawful in all the states. Welcome, or unwelcome, such\ndecision is probably coming, and will soon be upon us,\nunless the power of the present political dynasty shall be\nmet and overthrown. We shall lie down pleasantly dreaming\nthat the people of Missouri are on the verge of making their\nstate free, and we shall awake to the reality instead, that\nthe Supreme Court has made Illinois a slave state. To meet\nand overthrow the power of that dynasty, is the work now\nbefore all those who would prevent that consummation.\nThat is what we have to do. How can we best do it?\n\u201cThere are those who denounce us openly to their own\nfriends, and yet whisper us softly that Senator Douglas is\nthe aptest instrument there is with which to e\ufb00ect that\nobject. They wish us to infer all, from the fact that he now\nhas a little quarrel with the present head of the dynasty;\nand that he has regularly voted with us on a single point,\nupon which he and we have never di\ufb00ered. They remind us\nthat he is a great man, and that the largest of us are very\nsmall ones. Let this be granted. But \u2018a living dog is better\nthan a dead lion.\u2019 Judge Douglas, if not a dead lion, for this\nwork, is at least a caged and toothless one. How can he\noppose the advances of slavery? He don\u2019t care anything\nabout it. His avowed mission is impressing the public heart\nto care nothing about it. A leading Douglas democratic\nnewspaper thinks Douglas\u2019 superior talent will be needed\nto resist the revival of the African slave trade. Does\n Douglas \nbelieve \nan \ne\ufb00ort \nto \nrevive \nthat \ntrade \nis\napproaching? He has not said so. Does he really think so?\nBut if it is, how can he resist it? For years he has labored to\nprove it a sacred right of white men to take negro slaves\ninto the new territories. Can he possibly show that it is less\na sacred right to buy them where they can be bought\ncheapest? And unquestionably they can be bought cheaper\nin Africa than in Virginia. He has done all in his power to\nreduce the whole question of slavery to one of a mere right\nof property; and as such, how can he oppose the foreign\nslave trade \u2014 how can he refuse that trade in that\n\u2018property\u2019 shall be \u2018perfectly free\u2019 \u2014 unless he does it as a\nprotection to the home production? And as the home\nproducers will probably not ask the protection, he will be\nwholly without a ground of opposition.\n\u201cSenator Douglas holds, we know, that a man may\nrightfully be wiser to-day than he was yesterday \u2014 that he\nmay rightfully change when he \ufb01nds himself wrong. But\ncan we, for that reason, run ahead, and infer that he will\nmake any particular change of which he himself has given\nno intimation? Can we safely base our action upon any such\nvague inference? Now, as ever, I wish not to misrepresent\nJudge Douglas\u2019 position, question his motives, or do aught\nthat can be personally o\ufb00ensive to him. Whenever, if ever,\nhe and we can come together on principle so that our cause\nmay have assistance from his great ability, I hope to have\ninterposed no adventitious obstacle. But clearly, he is not\nnow with us \u2014 he does not pretend to be \u2014 he does not\npromise ever to be.\n \u201cOur cause, then, must be intrusted to, and conducted\nby, its own undoubted friends \u2014 those whose hands are\nfree, whose hearts are in the work \u2014 who do care for the\nresult. Two years ago the Republicans of the nation\nmustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong. We did\nthis under the single impulse of resistance to a common\ndanger, with every external circumstance against us. Of\nstrange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we\ngathered from the four winds, and formed and fought the\nbattle through, under the constant hot ire of a disciplined,\nproud and pampered enemy. Did we brave all then, to falter\nnow? \u2014 now, when that same enemy is wavering,\ndissevered and belligerent? The result is not doubtful. We\nshall not fail \u2014 if we stand \ufb01rm, we shall not fail. Wise\ncounsels may accelerate, or mistakes delay it, but, sooner\nor later, the victory is sure to come.\u201d\nThe members of the convention carried away with them\nsomething to think about. There had been in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nspeech no appeals to their partisan prejudices, no tricks to\ncatch applause. He had appeared before them as an\nearnest, patriotic man, intent only on discussing, in the\ngravest an most candid manner, the most interesting and\nmomentous political questions.\nOn the ninth of July, Mr. Douglas made a speech in\nChicago. The reception he received was a magni\ufb01cent one\n\u2014 one which might well have \ufb01lled him with the\ngrati\ufb01cation which he did not attempt to conceal \u2014 which,\nindeed, he took repeated occasion to express. In this\nspeech he alluded to his e\ufb00orts to crush the Lecompton\n fraud, and claimed that the republicans who had fought by\nhis side had indorsed his popular sovereignty doctrine \u2014\nthe right of the people of a territory to form their own\ninstitutions.\nHe then took up the action of the republican convention\nat Spring\ufb01eld, and spoke at length of Mr. Lincoln and his\nspeech. Of Mr. Lincoln, he said: \u201cI take great pleasure in\nsaying that I have known, personally and intimately, for\nabout a quarter of a century, the worthy gentleman who has\nbeen nominated for my place, and I will say that I regard\nhim as a kind, amiable and intelligent gentleman, a good\ncitizen and an honorable opponent; and whatever issue I\nmay have with him will be of principle and not of\npersonalities.\u201d He then read from the opening paragraph of\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s speech the words: \u201cA house divided against\nitself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot\nendure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect\nthe Union to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall,\nbut I do expect it to cease to be divided. It will become all\none thing or all the other.\u201d The unfairness of his comments\nupon this simple statement of a conviction may be gathered\nfrom the construction which he put upon it in the words\u2014\n\u201cMr. Lincoln advocates boldly and clearly a war of sections,\na war of the North against the South, of the free states\nagainst the slave states, a war of extermination, to be\ncontinued relentlessly, until the one or the other shall be\nsubdued, and all the states shall either become free or\nbecome slave.\u201d\n Mr. Lincoln foresaw the approaching struggle between\nfreedom and slavery and its inevitable result. He did not\nbelieve a dissolution of the Union possible, but he knew\nthat freedom and slavery were irreconcilable enemies. He\nknew that slavery must die, or become national. He saw the\ndetermination of its friends to make it national, and he\nbelieved that this attempt would succeed, or that, failing of\nsuccess, it would end in the universal abolition of slavery.\nEvents have entirely justi\ufb01ed his most philosophical view of\nthe subject.\nThe next point that Mr. Douglas endeavored to make was\nas illegitimate as his previous one, viz: that Mr. Lincoln\ndesired to reduce the states to a dead uniformity of\ninterests and institutions, contrary to the theory and policy\nof the fathers of the republic. In order to do this, he was of\ncourse obliged to ignore the fact that Mr. Lincoln had\nalluded to but one institution, and that, in its nature\nantagonistic with the principles of the Declaration of\nIndependence, and to recognize slavery as having the same\nlegitimate basis with the other institutions of the country.\nHaving construed Mr. Lincoln\u2019s position unfairly, he\nlogically drove to the unjust conclusion that when the\nuniformity should be attained which Mr. Lincoln desired,\nthe government would have \u201cconverted these thirty-two\nsovereign, independent states, into one consolidated\nempire, \nwith \nthe \nuniformity \nof \ndisposition \nreigning\ntriumphant throughout the length and breadth of the land.\u201d\nHe next took up Mr. Lincoln\u2019s criticism of the Dred Scott\ndecision, and, by his treatment of it, fully vindicated the\n action of the Illinois republicans in their refusal to support\nhim in accordance with the wishes of their eastern friends.\nNo republican could consistently support a man who\nsupported that iniquitous and barbarous decision. If it is\nsaid that his course on this question would have been\nchanged by their support, the case is still worse, for no man\nwhose course could be changed by such considerations\nwould be worthy of the support of any party. \u201cI am opposed\nto this doctrine of Mr. Lincoln,\u201d said Mr. Douglas, \u201cby which\nhe proposes to take an appeal from the decision of the\nSupreme Court of the United States upon this high\nconstitutional question, to a republican caucus sitting in\nthe country... I respect the decisions of that august\ntribunal; I shall always bow in deference to them... I will\nsustain the judicial tribunals and constituted authorities, in\nall matters within the pale of their jurisdiction, as de\ufb01ned\nby the Constitution.\u201d Mr. Douglas did not see \ufb01t to allude in\nthis speech to Mr. Lincoln\u2019s charge that the Dred Scott\ndecision was a part of that building framed so cunningly by\n\u201cStephen, Franklin, Roger and James,\u201d in which was to be\nconserved the power of making slavery universal.\nMr. Douglas went farther than simply to indorse the Dred\nScott decision, and to declare his intention to sustain it. \u201cI\nam equally free,\u201d said he, \u201cto say that the reason assigned\nby Mr. Lincoln for resisting the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the Dred Scott case does not, in itself, meet my\napprobation... He says it is wrong, because it deprives the\nnegro of the bene\ufb01t of that clause of the Constitution which\nsays that the citizens of one state shall enjoy all the\n privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several\nstates; in other words, he thinks it wrong because it\ndeprives the negro of the privileges, immunities and rights\nof citizenship which pertain, according to that decision,\nonly to the white man. I am free to say to you that, in my\nopinion, this government of ours is founded on the white\nbasis. It was made for the white man, for the bene\ufb01t of the\nwhite man, to be administered by white men, in such\nmanner as they should determine. It is also true that a\nnegro, an indian, or any other man of inferior race to a\nwhite man should be permitted to enjoy, and humanity\nrequires that he should have, all the rights, privileges and\nimmunities which he is capable of exercising, consistent\nwith the safety of society.\u201d What these rights should be,\nwas only legitimately to be determined by the states\nthemselves, in Mr. Douglas\u2019 opinion. Illinois had decided for\nherself what the black man\u2019s rights were in Illinois, and\nNew York and Maine had decided for themselves. By\ninference, Kentucky had a right to say her negroes should\nbe slaves, Illinois that her negroes should not vote, New\nYork that her negroes might vote when quali\ufb01ed by\nproperty, and Maine that the negro was equal at the polls\nto the white man.\nThese were the main points that Mr. Douglas made in his\nChicago speech. Mr. Lincoln sat near him, on the platform,\nand heard the whole of it. Here, as elsewhere during the\ncampaign which succeeded, he manifested his wonderful\ngood nature under misrepresentation. There were incidents\nof this campaign which no man cast in the common mould\n could have passed through without yielding to the severest\npassions of indignation and anger. He was belied, abused,\nmisrepresented; but he never betrayed a moment\u2019s\nirritation. That he smarted with a sense of wrong, there is\nabundant evidence; but he was never moved to a single act\nof resentment.\nMr. Lincoln had taken the speech all in, and, on the\nfollowing evening, it was announced that he would reply to\nit. The greeting which he received when he took the stand\nwas quite as enthusiastic as that which Mr. Douglas had\nmet on the previous evening. He was introduced to the\naudience by Mr. C.L. Wilson of Chicago, and when he came\nforward, there was such a storm of long-continued\napplause that he was obliged to extend his hand in\ndeprecation, before he could secure the silence necessary\nfor proceeding. After disposing of some minor matters, he\ntook up the points of Mr. Douglas\u2019 speech and treated them\nfully. Touching the comments upon his own declaration\u2014 \u201ca\nhouse divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this\ngovernment cannot endure permanently half slave and half\nfree,\u201d \nc., he said:\n\u201cI am not, in the \ufb01rst place, unaware that this\nGovernment has endured eighty-two years, half slave and\nhalf free. I know that. I am tolerably well acquainted with\nthe history of the country, and I know that it has endured\neighty-two years, half slave and half free. I believe \u2014 and\nthat is what I meant to allude to there \u2014 I believe it has\nendured, \nbecause \nduring \nall \nthat \ntime, \nuntil \nthe\nintroduction of the Nebraska bill, the public mind did rest\n all the time in the belief that slavery was in course of\nultimate extinction. That was what gave us the rest that we\nhad through that period of eighty-two years; at least, so I\nbelieve. I have always hated slavery, I think, as much as any\nabolitionist \u2014 I have been an old line whig \u2014 I have always\nhated it, but I have always been quiet about it until this\nnew era of the introduction of the Nebraska bill began. I\nalways believed that everybody was against it, and that it\nwas in course of ultimate extinction.\n\u201cThe adoption of the Constitution and its attendant\nhistory led the people to believe so; and such was the belief\nof the framers of the Constitution itself, else why did those\nold men, about the time of the adoption of the Constitution,\ndecree that slavery should not go into the new territory,\nwhere it had not already gone? Why declare that within\ntwenty years the African slave trade, by which slaves are\nsupplied, might be cut o\ufb00 by Congress? Why were all these\nacts? I might enumerate more of these acts \u2014 but enough.\nWhat were they but a clear indication that the framers of\nthe Constitution intended and expected the ultimate\nextinction of that institution? And now, when I say, as I said\nin my speech that Judge Douglas has quoted from \u2014 when I\nsay that I think the opponents of slavery will resist the\nfarther spread of it, and place it where the public mind\nshall rest with the belief that it is in course of ultimate\nextinction, I only mean to say that they will place it where\nthe founders of this Government originally placed it.\n\u201cI have said a hundred times, and I have now no\ninclination to take it back, that I believe there is no right,\n and ought to be no inclination in the people of the free\nstates to enter into the slave states, and interfere with the\nquestion of slavery at all. I have said that always; Judge\nDouglas has heard me say it \u2014 if not quite a hundred times,\nat least as good as a hundred times; and when it is said that\nI am in favor of interfering with slavery where it exists, I\nknow it is unwarranted by anything I have ever intended,\nand, as I believe, by anything I have ever said. If, by any\nmeans, I have ever used language which could fairly be so\nconstrued (as, however, I believe I never have), I now\ncorrect it.\u201d\nThe next point touched upon was Judge Douglas\u2019 charge\nthat Mr. Lincoln was in favor of reducing the institutions of\nall the states to uniformity:\n\u201cNow in relation to his inference that I am in favor of a\ngeneral consolidation of all the local institutions of the\nvarious states. I will attend to that for a little while, and try\nto inquire, if I can, how on earth it could be that any man\ncould draw such an inference from anything I said. I have\nsaid, very many times, in Judge Douglas\u2019 hearing, that no\nman believed more than I in the principle of self-\ngovernment; that it lies at the bottom of all my ideas of just\ngovernment, from beginning to end. I have denied that his\nuse of that term applies properly. But for the thing itself, I\ndeny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in his\ndevotion to the principle, whatever he may have done in\ne\ufb00iciency in advocating it. I think that I have laid it in your\nhearing \u2014 that I believe each individual is naturally entitled\nto do as he pleases with himself and the fruit of his labor, so\n far as it in no wise interferes with any other man\u2019s rights \u2014\nthat each community, as a state, has a right to do exactly as\nit pleases with all the concerns within that state that\ninterferes with the right of no other state, and that the\ngeneral government, upon principle, has no right to\ninterfere with anything other than that general class of\nthings that does concern the whole. I have said that at all\ntimes. I have said as illustrations, that I do not believe in\nthe right of Illinois to interfere with the cranberry laws of\nIndiana, the oyster laws of Virginia, or the liquor laws of\nMaine. I have said these things over aud over again, and I\nrepeat them here as my sentiments.\n\u201cHow is it, then, that Judge Douglas infers, because I\nhope to see slavery put where the public mind shall rest in\nthe belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, that\nI am in favor of Illinois going over and interfering with the\ncranberry laws of Indiana? What can authorize him to draw\nany such inference? I suppose there might be one thing\nthat at least enabled him to draw such an inference that\nwould not be true with me or many others, that is, because\nhe looks upon all this matter of slavery as an exceedingly\nlittle thing \u2014 this matter of keeping one-sixth of the\npopulation of the whole nation in a state of oppression and\ntyranny unequaled in the world. He looks upon it as being\nan exceedingly little thing \u2014 only equal to the question of\nthe cranberry laws of Indiana \u2014 as something having no\nmoral question in it \u2014 as something on a par with the\nquestion of whether a man shall pasture his land with\ncattle, or plant it with tobacco \u2014 so little and so small a\n thing, that he concludes, if I could desire that if anything\nshould be done to bring about the ultimate extinction of\nthat little thing, I must be in favor of bringing about an\namalgamation of all the other little things in the Union.\nNow, it so happens \u2014 and there, I presume, is the\nfoundation of this mistake \u2014 that the Judge thinks thus;\nand it so happens that there is a vast portion of the\nAmerican people that do not look upon that matter as being\nthis very little thing. They look upon it as a vast moral evil;\nthey can prove it such by the writings of those who gave us\nthe blessings of liberty which we enjoy, and that they so\nlooked upon it, not as an evil merely con\ufb01ning itself to the\nstates where it is situated; and while we agree that, by the\nConstitution we assented to, in the states where it exists we\nhave no right to interfere with it, because it is in the\nConstitution; we are by both duty and inclination to stick by\nthat Constitution, in all its letter and spirit, from beginning\nto end.\n\u201cSo much then as to my disposition \u2014 my wish \u2014 to have\nall the state legislatures blotted out, and to have one\nconsolidated government, and a uniformity of domestic\nregulations in all the states by which I suppose it is meant,\nif we raise corn here, we must make sugar-cane grow here\ntoo, and we must make those which grow North grow in the\nSouth. All this I suppose he understands I am in favor of\ndoing. Now, so much for all this nonsense \u2014 for I must call\nit so. The Judge can have no issue with me on a question of\nestablishing uniformity in the domestic regulations of the\nstates.\u201d\n Concerning the Dred Scott decision he said:\n\u201cI have expressed heretofore, and I now repeat, my\nopposition to the Dred Scott decision, but I should be\nallowed to state the nature of that opposition, and I ask\nyour indulgence while I do so. What is fairly implied by the\nterm Judge Douglas has used, \u2018resistance to the decision?\u2019 I\ndo not resist it. If I wanted to take Dred Scott from his\nmaster, I would be interfering with property, and that\nterrible di\ufb00iculty that Judge Douglas speaks of, of\ninterfering with property would arise. But I am doing no\nsuch thing as that, but all that I am doing is refusing to\nobey it as a political rule. If I were in Congress, and a vote\nshould come up on a question whether slavery should be\nprohibited in a new territory, in spite of the Dred Scott\ndecision, I would vote that it should.\n\u201cThat is what I would do. Judge Douglas said last night,\nthat before the decision he might advance his opinion, and\nit might be contrary to the decision when it was made; but\nafter it was made he would abide by it until it was reversed.\nJust so! We let this property abide by the decision, but we\nwill try to reverse that decision. We will try to put it where\nJudge Douglas would not object, for he says he will obey it\nuntil it is reversed. Somebody has to reverse that decision,\nsince it is made, and we mean to reverse it, and we mean to\ndo it peaceably.\n\u201cWhat are the uses of decisions of courts? They have two\nuses. As rules of property they have two uses. First \u2014 they\ndecide upon the question before the court. They decide in\nthis case that Dred Scott is a slave. Nobody resists that.\n Not only that, but they say to everybody else, that persons\nstanding just as Dred Scott stands, is as he is. That is, they\nsay that when a question comes up upon another person, it\nwill be so decided again, unless the court decides in\nanother way, unless the court overrules its decision. Well,\nwe mean to do what we can to have the court decide the\nother way. That is one thing we mean to try to do.\n\u201cThe sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this\ndecision, is a degree of sacredness that has never been\nbefore thrown around any other decision. I have never\nheard of such a thing. Why, decisions apparently contrary\nto that decision, or that good lawyers thought were\ncontrary to that decision, have been made by that very\ncourt before. It is the \ufb01rst of its kind; it is an astonisher in\nlegal history. It is a new wonder of the world. It is based\nupon falsehood in the main as to the facts \u2014 allegations of\nfacts upon which it stands are not facts at all in many\ninstances \u2014 and no decision made on any question \u2014 the\n\ufb01rst instance of a decision made under so many\nunfavorable circumstances \u2014 thus placed, has ever been\nheld by the profession as law, and it has always needed\ncon\ufb01rmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled law.\nBut Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must take this\nextraordinary decision, made under these extraordinary\ncircumstances, and give their vote in Congress in\naccordance with it, yield to it and obey it in every possible\nsense. Circumstances alter cases. Do not gentlemen here\nremember the case of that same Supreme Court, some\ntwenty-\ufb01ve or thirty years ago, deciding that a national\n bank was constitutional? I ask, if somebody does not\nremember that a national bank was declared to be\nconstitutional? \nSuch \nis \nthe \ntruth, \nwhether \nit \nbe\nremembered or not. The bank charter ran out, and a re-\ncharter was granted by Congress. That re-charter was laid\nbefore General Jackson. It was urged upon him, when he\ndenied the constitutionality of the bank that the Supreme\nCourt had decided was constitutional; and General Jackson\nthen said that the Supreme Court had no right to lay down\na rule to govern a co-ordinate branch of the Government,\nthe members of which had sworn to support the\nConstitution \u2014 that each member had sworn to support\nthat Constitution as he understood it. I will venture here to\nsay, that I have heard Judge Douglas say that he approved\nof General Jackson for that act. What has now become of all\nhis tirade about \u2018resistance to the Supreme Court?\u2019\u201d\nThere were some passages in this speech which\nillustrated Mr. Lincoln\u2019s readiness in \u201cputting things\u201d to the\ncommon apprehension. After having said that the much\nvaunted \u201cpopular sovereignty\u201d which Mr. Douglas had put\nforth as his own invention was something which, when\nproperly de\ufb01ned, the republicans had always accepted and\nacted upon, and that it came, not from Judge Douglas, but\nfrom the Declaration of Independence, which states that\ngovernments derive their just powers \u201cfrom the consent of\nthe governed,\u201d he alluded to the defeat of the Lecompton\nConstitution in Congress. He said that the republicans took\nground against the Lecompton Constitution long before\nJudge Douglas did, and that he held in his hand a speech in\n which he urged the same reason against Douglas the year\nbefore that he (Douglas) was urging now. He went on:\n\u201cA little more, now, as to this matter of popular\nsovereignty \nand \nthe \nLecompton \nConstitution. \nThe\nLecompton Constitution, as the Judge tells us, was\ndefeated. The defeat of it was a good thing, or it was not.\nHe thinks the defeat of it was a good thing, and so do I, and\nwe agree in that. Who defeated it?\n\u201cA voice\u2014 \u2018Judge Douglas.\u2019\n\u201cMr. Lincoln \u2014 Yes, he furnished himself and, if you\nsuppose he furnished the other democrats that went with\nhim, he furnished three votes, while the republicans\nfurnished twenty. That is what he did to defeat it. In the\nHouse of Representatives he and his friends furnished\nsome twenty votes and the republicans ninety odd. Now\nwho was it that did the work?\n\u201cA voice\u2014 \u2018Douglas.\u2019\n\u201cMr. Lincoln \u2014 Why, yes, Douglas did it. To be sure he\ndid. Let us, however, put that proposition another way. The\nrepublicans could not have done it without Judge Douglas.\nCould he have done it without them? Which could have\ncome the nearest to doing it without the other?\u201d\nThe following point was so neatly made that it drew from\nthe house three hearty cheers:\n\u201cWe were often \u2014 more than once at least \u2014 in the\ncourse of Judge Douglas\u2019 speech last night, reminded that\nthis government was made for white men \u2014 that he\nbelieved it was made for white men. Well, that is putting it\ninto a shape in which no one wants to deny it; but the Judge\n then goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are\nnot warranted. I protest, now and forever, against that\ncounterfeit logic which presumes that because I do not\nwant a negro woman for a slave, I do necessarily want her\nfor a wife. My understanding is that I need not have her for\neither, but, as God made us separate, we can leave one\nanother alone, and do one another much good thereby.\nThere are white men enough to marry all the white women,\nand enough black men to marry all the black women, and in\nGod\u2019s name let them be so married. The Judge regales us\nwith the terrible enormities that take place by the mixture\nof races; that the inferior race bears the superior down.\nWhy, Judge, if we do not let them get together in the\nterritories they won\u2019t mix there.\u201d\nAnd thus was opened the grand senatorial campaign of\n. Mr. Douglas had not been present at Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nspeech, a fact which Mr. Lincoln regretted, and he soon\ntook measures to secure his attendance. In the meantime,\nthe campaign went on. Mr. Douglas spoke a week later at\nBloomington, making much, as usual, of his doctrine of\npopular sovereignty, and of his rebellion against the\nadministration on the Lecompton question. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\noriginal \nSpring\ufb01eld \nspeech \ncame \nin \nfor \ncomment,\nparticularly the two points which he criticised at Chicago.\nMr. Lincoln was present on this occasion also, determined\nto \ufb01nd out the exact ground of his antagonist, that he might\nbe able to meet him in the struggle which he had\ndetermined upon. On the day following his Bloomington\nspeech, Mr. Douglas spoke at Spring\ufb01eld, as did also Mr.\n Lincoln, though not at the same meeting. Mr. Lincoln, in\nopening his speech, alluded to the disadvantages which the\nrepublicans of the state labored under in the unjust\napportionment of the legislative districts, and particularly\nin the disparity that existed between the reputation and\nprospects of the senatorial candidates of the two parties.\nAll the anxious politicians of the party of Mr. Douglas had\nbeen looking upon him as certain, at no distant day, to be\nthe President of the United States. \u201cThey have seen,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cin his round, jolly, fruitful face, post-o\ufb00ices, land-\no\ufb00ices, marshalships and cabinet appointments, charge-\nships and foreign missions, bursting and sprouting out, in\nwonderful luxuriance, ready to be laid hold of by their\ngreedy hands. And as they have been gazing upon this\nattractive picture so long, they cannot, in the little\ndistraction that has taken place in the party, bring\nthemselves to give up the charming hope; but with greedier\nanxiety they rush about him, sustain him, and give him\nmarches, triumphal entries and receptions, beyond what,\neven in the days of his highest prosperity, they could have\nbrought about in his favor. On the contrary, nobody has\never expected me to be president. In my poor, lean, lank\nface nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were\nsprouting out.\u201d The main body of the speech was devoted to\nthe questions at issue between him and Judge Douglas, and\ndoes not contain matter of special interest beyond what he\nhad previously uttered upon the same points. He closed by\nreiterating the charge made in his speech of June\nseventeenth that Mr. Douglas was a party to the conspiracy\n for deceiving the people with the idea that the settlers of a\nterritory could exclude slavery from their limits if they\nshould choose to do so, and, at the same time, rendering it\nimpossible for them to do so through the standing veto of\nthe Dred Scott decision. The charge was a grave one, but\nMr. Douglas had ignored it. Since it was made, he had not\nalluded to it at all. \u201cOn his own tacit admission,\u201d said Mr.\nLincoln, \u201cI renew the charge.\u201d\n   ha ter  III.\nMR. LINCOLN WANTED closer work than Mr. Douglas had\ngiven him. He desired to address the same audiences with\nhis antagonist, and to show to those whom he addressed\nthe fallacy of his reasoning and the groundlessness of his\ncharges. Accordingly, on the twenty-fourth of July, he\ndispatched the following note: \u2014\n\u201cHon. B. A. Douglas \u2014 My Dear Sir: Will it be agreeable\nto you to make an arrangement for you and myself to divide\ntime, and address the same audiences the present canvass?\nMr. Judd, who will hand you this, is authorized to receive\nyour answer; and, if agreeable to you, to enter into the\nterms of such arrangement.\n\u201cYour obedient servant, A. Lincoln.\u201d\nTo this Mr. Douglas replied, stating that recent events\nhad interposed di\ufb00iculties in the way of such an\narrangement. In connection with the State Central\nCommittee at Spring\ufb01eld, he had made a series of\nappointments extending over nearly the whole period that\nremained before the election, and the people of the various\nlocalities had been noti\ufb01ed of the times and places of the\nmeetings. The candidates for Congress, the legislature and\nother o\ufb00ices would desire to speak at these meetings, and\nthus all the time would be occupied. Then he proceeded to\ngive, as a further reason for his refusal, that it was\n intended to bring out another candidate for United States\nsenator, to divide the democratic vote for the bene\ufb01t of Mr.\nLincoln, and that he (the third candidate) would also claim\na chance in the joint debates, so that he (said third\ncandidate) and Mr. Lincoln would have the opening and\nclosing speech in every instance. While, therefore, he\ndeclined the general invitation, he declared himself ready\nto make an arrangement for seven joint debates in the\ncongressional districts respectively where they had not\nalready spoken, and at the following places, viz: Freeport,\nOttawa, \nGalesburg, \nQuincy, \nAlton, \nJonesboro \nand\nCharleston. This letter was published in the Chicago Times,\nand read there by Mr. Lincoln before he received the\nautograph by mail.\nTo this letter Mr. Lincoln responded, denying, of course,\nthe foolish charge of intended unfairness in bringing in a\nthird candidate to divide the time to the disadvantage of\nMr. Douglas, and agreeing to speak in the seven places\nmentioned. There is other matter in these letters which\nthoroughly discovers the characteristics of the two writers,\nbut it must be left behind.\nMr. Douglas replied to this second letter of Mr. Lincoln,\ndesignating the time and places of the debate as they\nfollow:\nOttawa, LaSalle County, August st, ; Freeport,\nStephenson County, August th; Jonesboro, Union County,\nSeptember th; Charleston, Coles County, September\nth; Galesburg, Knox County, October th; Quincy, Adams\n County, October th; Alton, Madison County, October\nth.\nThe terms proposed in this letter and accepted in a\nsubsequent note by Mr. Lincoln, were, that at Ottawa, Mr.\nDouglas should speak an hour, then Mr. Lincoln an hour\nand a half; Mr. Douglas having the closing speech of half an\nhour. At the next place, Mr. Lincoln should open and close\nin the same way, and so on, alternately, to the conclusion of\nthe arrangement.\nAs about three weeks intervened between the date of this\nagreement for joint debates and the \ufb01rst appointment, both\nparties engaged zealously in their independent work. Mr.\nLincoln began his canvass at Beardstown, the spot where,\ntwenty-\ufb01ve years before, he had taken his military company\nfor rendezvous before starting out for the Black Hawk war.\nAfter making a speech here, he went up the Illinois River to\nHavana and Bath in Mason County, to Lewistown and\nCanton in Fulton County, and to Peoria and Henry in\nMarshall County, making speeches at each place, and\nattracting immense audiences. Mr. Douglas was equally\nbusy, and equally fortunate in attracting the people to listen\nto his utterances upon the great questions of the day. At\nClinton, in DeWitt County, he found it no longer possible to\npass in silence the charge of Mr. Lincoln that he had \u201cleft a\nniche in the Nebraska bill to receive the Dred Scott\ndecision,\u201d which declared in e\ufb00ect, that a territorial\nlegislature could not abolish slavery. Mr. Douglas here\nstated that his self-respect alone prevented him from\ncalling \nthis \ncharge \na \nfalsehood. \nSubsequently, \nat\n Beardstown, he broke over his restraints, and called it \u201can\ninfamous lie.\u201d To this Mr. Lincoln responded on a\nsubsequent occasion as follows:\n\u201cI say to you, gentlemen, that it would be more to the\npurpose for Judge Douglas to say that he did not repeal the\nMissouri compromise; that he did not make slavery possible\nwhere it was impossible before; that he did not leave a\nniche in the Nebraska bill for the Dred Scott decision to\nrest in; that he did not vote down a clause giving the people\nthe right to exclude slavery if they wanted to; that he did\nnot refuse to give his individual opinion whether a\nterritorial legislature could exclude slavery; that he did not\nmake a report to the senate in which he said that the rights\nof the people in this regard were held in abeyance, and\ncould not be immediately exercised; that he did not make a\nhasty indorsement of the Dred Scott decision over at\nSpring\ufb01eld; that he does not now indorse that decision;\nthat that decision does not take away from the territorial\nlegislature the power to exclude slavery; and that he did\nnot in the original Nebraska bill so couple the words \u2018state\u2019\nand \u2018territory\u2019 together that what the Supreme Court has\ndone in forcing open all the territories for slavery, it may\nyet do in forcing open all the state; \u2014 I say it would be\nvastly more to the point, for Judge Douglas to say he did\nnot do some of these things, did not forge some of the links\nof overwhelming testimony, than to go to vociferating about\nthe country that possibly he may be obliged to hint that\nsomebody is a liar.\u201d\n The \ufb01rst meeting of the series agreed upon was held at\nOttawa according to appointment. A concourse of citizens\nestimated at twelve thousand had assembled. Mr. Douglas\nhad the opening speech, and in this speech he resorted to\nan expedient for placing Mr. Lincoln on the defensive which\nwas either very weak, or very wicked. He made a charge\nagainst Mr. Lincoln which, if he knew it to be false, was\nfoul, and which, if he did not know to be true, was most\nimpolitic. He charged that Mr. Lincoln, on the part of the\nwhigs, and Mr. Trumbull, on the part of the democrats,\nentered into an arrangement in , for the dissolution of\nthe two parties, and the fusing of both in the republican\nparty, for the purpose of giving Lincoln Shields\u2019 place in the\nSenate, and Trumbull, his (Douglas\u2019) own. Furthermore,\nthat the parties met at Spring\ufb01eld in October of that year,\nand, in convention of their friends, laid down a platform of\nthe principles upon which the new party was constructed.\nHe then proceeded to read what he called \u201cthe most\nimportant and material resolutions of the abolition\nplatform.\u201d What these resolutions were, will appear in Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s replies to the questions which Mr. Douglas based\nupon them. His object in asking these questions was, as he\nsaid, in order that when he should \u201ctrot him (Lincoln)\ndown\u201d to lower Egypt (southern Illinois) he might put the\nsame questions to him there.\nThe hearty reception which the audience gave to the\nprinciples of this platform as he pronounced them, did not\nplease Mr. Douglas. He wished to see whether they would\n\u201cbear transplanting from Ottawa to Jonesboro.\u201d \u201cI have a\n right,\u201d said Mr. Douglas, \u201cto an answer, for I quote from the\nplatform of the republican party, made by himself (Lincoln)\nand others at the time that party was formed, and the\nbargain made by Mr. Lincoln to dissolve and kill the old\nwhig party, and transfer its members, bound hand and foot,\nto the abolition party, under the direction of Giddings and\nFred Douglass.\u201d\nMr. Douglas went on then to comment on Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nSpring\ufb01eld speech, which had come to be known as \u201cthe\nhouse-divided-against-itself speech,\u201d and slid, as usual, into\nhis talk about the inferiority of the negro. Speaking of Mr.\nLincoln and the \u201cabolition orators,\u201d he said, \u201che and they\nmaintain that negro equality is guaranteed by the laws of\nGod, and that it is asserted in the Declaration of\nIndependence. If they think so, of course they have a right\nto say so, and so vote. I do not question Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nconscientious belief that the negro was made his equal,\nand, hence, his brother; but for my own part, I do not\nregard the negro as my equal, and positively deny that he is\nmy brother, or any kin to me whatever.\u201d\nAnd here it may be said, because it will be impossible to\ndescribe with particularity all the speeches of the\ncampaign, that the staple of the speeches of Mr. Douglas,\nas well as those of Mr. Lincoln, related to a very few points,\nwhich may be summed up in a brace of paragraphs.\nMr. Douglas did not believe in natural negro equality, and\ndid believe that every state had the right to say just what\nrights she would confer upon the negro; that the people of\nevery territory had a right to decide as to what their\n institutions should be, while he bowed, at the same time, to\nthe Dred Scott decision, which declared that they had no\nright to abolish slavery; and that the country could endure\nhalf slave and half free as well for all coming time as it had\nfor the previous eighty years, while slavery itself, to him,\nwas a matter of indi\ufb00erence \u2014 an institution which might\nbe \u201cvoted up or voted down,\u201d without any appeal to his\npreferences.\nOn the other hand, Mr. Lincoln placed himself on the\nbroad ground of the Declaration of Independence, that all\nmen are created equal, and are by heaven endowed with\ncertain inalienable rights, such as life, liberty and the\npursuit of happiness. He recognized the negro as a man,\ncoming within the broad sweep of this Declaration. He\nbelieved thoroughly in Mr. Douglas\u2019 doctrine of popular\nsovereignty, without the Dred Scott quali\ufb01cation, which\nwas a direct denial of the sovereignty; but he believed the\nabrogation of the Missouri compromise, which Mr. Douglas\nhimself had e\ufb00ected, an unspeakable wrong, a foul breach\nof faith, by which it was rendered possible for the people of\na territory to choose slavery, and by which the forcing of\nslavery upon them was rendered practicable. Furthermore,\nhe saw in that \u201cpiece of machinery,\u201d made up of\ncongressional legislation, Supreme Court decisions and\nexecutive and party connivance, an attempt to nationalize\nand perpetuate slavery, which he felt must logically\nultimate in that result, or end in universal emancipation.\nSlavery, he believed, had lived by the side of freedom, and\nin partnership with it, simply because freedom had\n regarded itself as eternal, while it had regarded slavery as\nephemeral. Thus the fathers regarded and treated slavery.\nThey had curtailed its territory. They had forbidden the\nimportation of slaves. All their arrangements looked to an\nearly end of slavery; and Mr. Lincoln quoted the champions\nof slavery to sustain his views on this point. When the\npolicy of the government changed, and it was proposed to\nnationalize slavery and make it perpetual \u2014 to confer upon\nit the same rights with freedom \u2014 nay, to make it\nimpossible for freedom to abolish it \u2014 then he foresaw a\ncon\ufb02ict which could only end by its utter overthrow, or its\nuniversal prevalence. He did not believe the house would\nfall; he did believe that it would cease to be divided.\nThe seven joint debates rang their changes on these\npoints, as they were held and maintained by the debaters.\nMr. Douglas did not seem to be as fertile in thought and\nexpression as his antagonist. He was more given to\ndiversions, to the ordinary clap-trap of campaign speaking,\nto appeals to prejudices, to the springing of false issues, to\nquibbles and tricks. Mr. Lincoln, on the contrary, was in\nthorough earnest, and stuck with manly tenacity to the\ngreat questions he had in hand. He stripped every\nobjectionable proposition and every specious argument of\nthe disguises in which the ingenious language of Mr.\nDouglas had clothed them, and refused to be led away, by a\nhair\u2019s breadth, from the real, naked issues of the campaign.\nIn replying to Judge Douglas at Ottawa, he simply said\nthat the story of his bargain with Mr. Trumbull was not\ntrue, and that he was so far from having had anything to do\n with the convention to which the Senator had alluded that\nhe was attending court, o\ufb00 in Tazewell County, when it was\nheld. That was all there was of Mr. Douglas\u2019 charges. They\nhad not an inch of truth to stand upon; and it was\ndiscovered \nimmediately \nafter \nthe \ndebate \nthat \nthe\nresolutions which Mr. Douglas had quoted had not been\npassed in Spring\ufb01eld at all, by any convention, and that,\nalthough they had been uttered by a local convention in the\ntown of Aurora, they were, for the purposes used, and\nunder the circumstances, essentially a forgery, for which\nMr. Douglas or his friends were guiltily responsible. The\ncharge that Mr. Lincoln was in the convention, that he\nmade a bargain with Mr. Trumbull, that he was responsible\nfor a certain set of anti-slavery resolutions, and that the\nresolutions which he read were passed by the convention\nthat was held at Spring\ufb01eld, was false in every particular.\nDid Mr. Douglas know it to be so? Perhaps the only reply\nthat it is proper to make to this question is that he ought to\nhave known it to be so.\nIn Mr. Lincoln\u2019s reply, he quoted from his Peoria speech\nmade in , to which allusion has been made in this\nhistory, to show his exact position on the subject of slavery\nin the states where it existed. He said in that speech that\nhe had no prejudice against the southern people. They were\njust what we should be under their circumstances. \u201cIf\nslavery did not now exist among them, they would not\nintroduce it. If it did now exist among us, we should not\ninstantly give it up.\u201d He understood how di\ufb00icult it was to\nget rid of slavery, and he did not blame them for not doing\n what he should not know how to do himself. He\nacknowledged his constitutional obligations, and went so\nfar as to say that he would be willing to give them a law for\nreclaiming fugitives, provided a law could be made which\nwould not be more likely to carry a free man into slavery\nthan our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent\none. This, notwithstanding he hated slavery for the\nmonstrous injustice of slavery itself, and for its disgrace to\ndemocratic institutions. But all these facts had no e\ufb00ect\nupon his mind when he came to consider the question of\nextending slavery over territory now free. There was no\nmore excuse, in his opinion, for permitting slavery to go\ninto free territory, than for reviving the African slave-trade\nby law. \u201cThe law which forbids the bringing a slave from\nAfrica,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln, \u201cand that which has so long\nforbidden the taking of them to Nebraska, can hardly be\ndistinguished, on any moral principle.\u201d The principal point\nurged against Judge Douglas in this speech touched his\ndevotion to Supreme Court decisions. A decision of this\nCourt was to him a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d There was no\nappeal from it; and the next decision of this same Court,\nwhatever it might be, was indorsed in advance. It is simply\nfor the Supreme Court to say that no state under the\nConstitution can exclude slavery, and he must bow to the\ndecision, just as when it says no territory can thus exclude\nit. Mr. Lincoln closed his remarks on this point by an\nargumentum ad hominem, equally characteristic and\nclever:\n \u201cThe next decision, as much as this, will be a Thus saith\nthe Lord. There is nothing that can divert or turn him away\nfrom this decision. It is nothing that I point out to him that\nhis great prototype, General Jackson, did not believe in the\nbinding force of decisions. It is nothing to him that\nJe\ufb00erson did not so believe. I have said that I have often\nheard him approve of Jackson\u2019s course in disregarding the\ndecision of the Supreme Court pronouncing a national bank\nconstitutional. He says I did not hear him say so. He denies\nthe accuracy of my recollection. I say he ought to know\nbetter than I, but I will make no question about this thing,\nthough it still seems to me that I heard him say it twenty\ntimes. I will tell him though, that he now claims to stand on\nthe Cincinnati platform, which a\ufb00irms that Congress\ncannot charter a national bank, in the teeth of that old\nstanding decision that Congress can charter a bank. And I\nremind him of another piece of history on the question of\nrespect for judicial decisions, and it is a piece of Illinois\nhistory, belonging to a time when the large party to which\nJudge Douglas belonged were displeased with a decision of\nthe Supreme Court of Illinois, because they had decided\nthat a Governor could not remove a Secretary of State. You\nwill \ufb01nd the whole story in Ford\u2019s History of Illinois; and I\nknow that Judge Douglas will not deny that he was then in\nfavor of overslaughing that decision by the mode of adding\n\ufb01ve new Judges, so as to vote down the four old ones. Not\nonly so, but it ended in the Judge\u2019s sitting down on that\nvery bench as one of the \ufb01ve new Judges to break down the\nfour old ones. It was in this way precisely that he got his\n title of Judge. Now, when the Judge tells me that men\nappointed conditionally to sit as members of a court, will\nhave to be catechised beforehand upon some subject, I say,\n\u2018You know, Judge; you have tried it.\u2019 When he says a court\nof this kind will lose the con\ufb01dence of all men, will be\nprostituted and disgraced by such a proceeding, I say, \u2018You\nknoW best, Judge; you have been through the mill.\u2019 But I\ncannot shake Judge Douglas\u2019 teeth loose from the Dred\nScott decision. Like some obstinate animal (I mean no\ndisrespect,) that will hang on when he has once got his\nteeth \ufb01xed; you may cut o\ufb00 a leg, or you may tear away an\narm, still he will not relax his hold. And so I may point out\nto the Judge, and say that he is bespattered all over, from\nthe beginning of his political life to the present time, with\nattacks upon judicial decisions \u2014 I may cut o\ufb00 limb after\nlimb of his public record, and strive to wrench him from a\nsingle dictum of the court \u2014 yet I cannot divert him from it.\nHe hangs, to the last, to the Dred Scott decision. These\nthings show there is a purpose strong as death and eternity\nfor which he adheres to this decision, and for which he will\nadhere to all other decisions of the same court.\u201d\nAt the close of the half hour which Mr. Douglas employed\nin his reply to Mr. Lincoln, the latter was literally borne\naway upon the shoulders of his friends, in a frenzy of\nenthusiasm, a fact to which Mr. Douglas made playful\nallusion a few days afterwards, in the statement that Mr.\nLincoln was so much frightened that he had to be taken\nfrom the stand, and was laid up for seven days. Mr. Lincoln\nwas too simple, too much in earnest, and too sensitive, to\n take this badinage gracefully. He really supposed there\nmight be persons who would believe it, as appeared in a\nsubsequent speech, in which he made it a matter of\ncomplaint.\nAt the Freeport meeting, Mr. Lincoln had the opening\nspeech, and commenced by answering the interrogatories\nwhich Mr. Douglas had addressed to him at Ottawa, based\nupon the declarations of the Aurora resolutions. Mr.\nDouglas asked him if he stood pledged now to the same\ndetails of policy that he did in  \u2014 details which he\ndrew from the resolutions he had read; and to his questions\nMr. Lincoln made these replies, seriatim: that he was not\nthen, and never had been pledged to the unconditional\nrepeal of the fugitive slave law; that he was not then, and\nhad never been, pledged against the admission of any more\nslave states; that he did not stand pledged against the\nadmission of a new state into the Union with such a\nconstitution as the people of that state may see \ufb01t to make;\nthat he did not stand pledged to the abolition of slavery in\nthe District of Columbia; that he did not stand pledged to\nthe prohibition of the slave trade between the di\ufb00erent\nstates; and that he was pledged to a belief in the right and\nduty of Congress to prohibit slavery in all the United States\nterritories. After saying that he had replied in terms to the\nJudge, and that he was not \u201cpledged\u201d to any of these\nprinciples or measures, he further said that he would not\nhang upon the form of the questions, but utter what he did\nthink on all the subjects involved in them. He believed the\nsouthern people were entitled, under the Constitution, to a\n congressional fugitive slave law; said that he should be\nvery sorry to see any more slave states applying for\nadmission to the Union, and declared that he would not\nonly be glad to see slavery abolished in the District of\nColumbia, \nbut \nhe \nbelieved \nthat \nCongress \nhad \nthe\nconstitutional power to abolish it there. Having answered\nMr. Douglas\u2019 questions \u2014 these and the remainder \u2014 in\naccordance with opinions with which the reader is already\nfamiliar, he was ready to turn questioner, and give the\nJudge something to do, in the same line of e\ufb00ort. He had\nalready consulted with his friends concerning the matter,\nand, in his conversation on the subject, had dropped an\nexpression which showed that he was looking beyond the\nsenatorial contest for the grand results of the discussion. In\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s view the principal point of debate was Mr.\nDouglas\u2019 doctrine of popular sovereignty, in connection\nwith the Dred Scott decision \u2014 the two things in his\njudgment being in direct antagonism, and being, in reality,\na shameful fraud. This antagonism Mr. Lincoln proposed to\npresent in the form of interrogatories, but his friends\nremonstrated. \u201cIf you put that question to him,\u201d they said,\n\u201che will perceive that an answer, giving practical force and\ne\ufb00ect to the Dred Scott decision in the territories,\ninevitably loses him the battle; and he will therefore reply\nby o\ufb00ering the decision as an abstract principle, but\ndenying its practical application.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln,\n\u201cif he does that, he can never be President.\u201d His friends\nreplied, \u201cthat is not your lookout; you are after the\n senatorship.\u201d \u201cNo, gentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201cI am killing larger\ngame. The battle of  is worth a hundred of this.\u201d\nWhether Mr. Lincoln then expected to be the republican\ncandidate for the presidency in , there are no means of\njudging; but that he intended the discussion to damage Mr.\nDouglas\u2019 presidential prospects there is no doubt. So Mr.\nLincoln put his questions, which, in their order, were as\nthey follow:\n\u201c. If the people of Kansas shall, by means entirely\nunobjectionable in all other respects, adopt a state\nconstitution, and ask admission into the Union under it,\nbefore they have the requisite number of inhabitants\naccording to the English bill \u2014 some ninety-three thousand\n\u2014 will you vote to admit them?\n\u201c. Can the people of a United States territory, in any\nlawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United\nStates, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation\nof a state constitution?\n\u201c. If the Supreme Court of the United States shall\ndecide that states cannot exclude slavery from their limits,\nare you in favor of acquiescing in, adopting and following\nsuch decision, as a rule of political action?\n\u201c. Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in\ndisregard of how such acquisition may a\ufb00ect the nation on\nthe slavery question?\u201d\nTo the \ufb01rst question Mr. Douglas replied that he held it a\nsound role, of universal application, to require a territory to\ncontain the requisite population for a member of Congress,\nbefore it is admitted as a state into the Union; but it having\n been decided by Congress that Kansas had population\nenough for a slave state, he held that she had enough for a\nfree state. His answer to the second question was in brief\nthis: \u201cIt matters not what way the Supreme Court may\nhereafter decide, as to the abstract question whether\nslavery may or may not go into a territory under the\nConstitution, the people have the lawful means to introduce\nit, or exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery\ncannot exist a day, or an hour, anywhere, unless it is\nsupported by local police regulations. Those police\nregulations can only be established by the local legislature;\nand if the people are opposed to slavery, they will elect\nrepresentatives to that body who will, by unfriendly\nlegislation, e\ufb00ectually prevent the introduction of it into\ntheir midst.\u201d The third question he answered by stating\nthat a decision of the Supreme Court that states could not\nexclude slavery from their limits, would \u201cbe an act of moral\ntreason that no man on the bench would ever descend to.\u201d\nThe thing in his view was simply impossible. This left the\nreal question unanswered. Mr. Lincoln had not asked him\nwhether the Supreme Court would or could make such a\ndecision, but had inquired what he would do in the event\nthat it should. To the fourth interrogatory he replied,\n\u201cWhenever it becomes necessary, in our growth and\nprogress, to acquire more territory, I am in favor of it,\nwithout reference to the question of slavery; and when we\nhave acquired it I will leave the people free to do as they\nplease \u2014 either to make it slave or free territory as they\nprefer.\u201d\n To the answer to the second question Mr. Lincoln\nresponded by charging Mr. Douglas with changing his\nground; and referred to the record to prove his charge. He\nreferred to the inquiry made by Judge Trumbull of Judge\nDouglas in the United States Senate, on this very point,\nwhen the former asked the latter whether the people of a\nterritory had the lawful power to exclude slavery, prior to\nthe formation of a constitution. The Judge\u2019s reply then was\nthat it was a question to be decided by the Supreme Court.\nThe question has been decided by the Supreme Court, and\nnow the Judge, by saying that the people can exclude\nslavery if they choose, virtually says that it is not a question\nfor the Supreme Court but a question for the people. The\nproposition that \u201cslavery cannot exist a day or an hour\nwithout local police regulations\u201d is historically false, even\nin the case of Dred Scott himself, who was held in\nMinnesota territory not only without police regulations, but\nin the teeth of Congressional legislation, supposed to be\nvalid at the time. The absurdity of adhering to the Dred\nScott decision and maintaining popular sovereignty at the\nsame time, he put into a single sentence in a subsequent\nspeech, made in Ohio \u2014 a sentence which contained the\nwhole argument. It was declaring, he said, \u201cno less than\nthat a thing may lawfully be driven away from a place\nwhere it has a lawful right to be.\u201d\nIt is impossible to follow to their conclusion this series of\ndebates in the pages of this volume. Enough has been\nwritten to reveal the ground of the two antagonists, the\nmerits of the questions they discussed and their modes of\n conducting debate. Into the side questions which sprang up\non every fresh occasion, and which were connected with\npersons and local politics, it is not possible, and, perhaps,\nnot desirable, to follow the debaters. They kept their\nappointments, and ful\ufb01lled the terms of their arrangement.\nThey attracted to them immense crowds, wherever they\nappeared; and the whole nation looked on with an intense\ninterest. There has never been a local canvass since the\nformation of the government which so attracted the\nattention of the politicians of other states as this. It was the\nkey note of the coming presidential campaign. It was a\nthorough presentation of the issues upon which the next\nnational battle was to be fought. The eyes of all the eastern\nstates were turned to the west where young republicanism\nand old democracy were establishing the dividing lines of\nthe two parties, and preparing the ground for the great\nstruggle soon to be begun.\nTo say that Mr. Lincoln was the victor in this contest,\nmorally and intellectually, is simply to record the judgment\nof the world. To say that he was victor in every way before\nthe people of Illinois it needs only to be recorded that he\nreceived a majority in the popular vote over Mr. Douglas of\nfour thousand eighty-\ufb01ve. There is this to be said, however,\nin connection with these statements. Whatever the\nadvantages of Mr. Douglas may have been, Mr. Lincoln had\nthe great advantage of belonging to a new and aggressive\nparty, which had started freshly in the strife for power, and\nhad not been corrupted by power. It had not lived long\nenough to depart from the principles of truth and justice in\n which it had its birth. Standing on the ground that slavery\nwas wrong and that its perpetuation would be a calamity,\nand its di\ufb00usion through new territory a crime, Mr. Lincoln\nnot only felt, but knew, that he was right. This made him\nstrong. Mr. Douglas was looking for the presidency, and\nknew that if he should ever reach and grasp the prize\nbefore him, he must do it through the aid of the\nslaveholding states. He knew that he could only secure this\nsupport by a certain degree of friendliness, or an entire\nindi\ufb00erence, to slavery. He intended to ride into power on\nthe back of popular sovereignty, giving at least nominal\nequality to slavery and freedom in the territories, while, at\nthe same time, endorsing the decision of the Supreme\nCourt as to what the exact rights of slavery were, under the\nConstitution. His policy was not only that of the democratic\nparty of Illinois, but essentially that of the whole North. He\nboasted of this on one occasion, upon which Mr. Lincoln\nretorted the charge of sectionalism. Mr. Douglas had been\nobliged to defer so much to the spirit of freedom and to the\nrights of free labor in the territories \u2014 had been obliged for\nfear of defeat to go so far from the original path he had\nmarked out for himself \u2014 that Mr. Lincoln called his\nattention to the fact that his speeches would not pass\ncurrent south of the Ohio so readily as they had formerly\ndone. \u201cWhatever may be the result of this ephemeral\ncontest between Judge Douglas and myself,\u201d said he, \u201cI see\nthe day rapidly approaching when his pill of \u2018sectionalism,\u2019\nwhich he has been thrusting down the throats of\nrepublicans for years past, will be crowded down his own\n throat.\u201d It was undoubtedly the grand aim of Mr. Lincoln,\nthroughout the whole series of debates, to drive Mr.\nDouglas into such an open declaration for slavery as to\nsecure his defeat for the senatorial o\ufb00ice, or, failing in that,\nto compel him to such declarations on behalf of freedom as\nwould spoil him as a southern candidate for the presidency.\n\u201cThe battle of  is worth a hundred of this,\u201d Mr. Lincoln\nhad said to his friends before the Freeport debate. He saw\nfurther than they. He was \u201ckilling larger game\u201d than the\nsenatorship, and he certainly did kill, or assist in killing,\nJudge Douglas, as a southern candidate for the presidency.\nThese debates of these two champions, respectively of\nthe principles of the Declaration of Independence and of\nparty policy, were published entire as a campaign\ndocument in the republican interest, when Mr. Lincoln was\nnominated for the presidency, without a word of comment,\nthe people being left to form their own conclusions as to\nthe merits of the controversy, and the relative ability of the\nmen whom it represented.\nIt is in vain to look for any better presentation of the\nprinciples of the republican party, or a better de\ufb01nition of\nthe issues which divided it from the democratic party of the\ntime, than are to be found in these speeches of Mr. Lincoln.\nThey cover the whole ground. They are clear, sound,\nlogical, powerful and exhaustive; and, in connection with\ntwo or three speeches made afterwards in Ohio and New\nYork, form the chief material on which his reputation as an\norator and a debater must rest. The man who shall write\nthe story of the great rebellion on behalf of human slavery\n must go back to these masterly speeches of an Illinois\nlawyer to \ufb01nd the clearest and most complete statement of\nthose di\ufb00erences between the power of slavery, and the\nspirit of freedom \u2014 the policy of slavery and the policy of\nfreedom \u2014 which ended, after expenditures of uncounted\ntreasure and unmeasured blood, in the \ufb01nal overthrow of\nthe accursed institution.\nMr. Lincoln was beaten in his contest for the seat of Mr.\nDouglas in the Senate, in consequence of the unfair\napportionment of the legislative districts. When it came to a\nballot in the legislature, it was found that there were\nfourteen democrats to eleven republicans in the Senate,\nand forty democrats to thirty-\ufb01ve republicans in the House.\nThis re-instated Mr. Douglas; and the champion of the\nrepublican party was defeated after a contest fought by him\nwith wonderful power and persistence, with unfailing\nfairness, good nature and magnanimity, and with a skill\nrarely if ever surpassed. He had visited every part of the\nstate, made about sixty speeches, been received by the\npeople everywhere with unbounded enthusiasm, had grown\nstrong with every day\u2019s exercise, was conscious that he had\nworsted his antagonist in the intellectual struggle, and,\nwhen defeat came, he could not have been otherwise than\ndisappointed. On being asked by a friend how he felt when\nthe returns came in that insured his defeat, he replied that\nhe felt, he supposed, very much like the stripling who had\nbruised his toe\u2014 \u201ctoo badly to laugh and too big to cry.\u201d\nBut the battle of  was indeed worth a hundred of that,\nand to it, events will swiftly lead us.\n   ha ter  I .\nTHE WINTER OF  and  found Mr. Lincoln at\nleisure. His absorption in political pursuits had materially\ninterfered with his professional business, although he\nretained all that he had the disposition to attend to. At this\npoint occurred one of those strange diversions that were so\ncharacteristic of the man. He eat down and wrote, in the\nform of a lecture, a comprehensive history of inventions,\nbeginning with the handiwork in brass and iron of Tubal\nCain, and ending with the latest products of inventive art.\nThis lecture he delivered at Spring\ufb01eld, and, in a single\ninstance, in another city, but there the public delivery of it\nceased. Whether he undertook this to detach his mind from\nsubjects which had held it so long, or whether he did it to\nbe able to meet the invitations that came to him from many\nquarters to address the winter lyceums, does not appear.\nThe e\ufb00ort does not seem to have been a satisfactory one to\nhimself; and it is easy to see that it was not likely to be\nparticularly attractive to the lecture-going public. Reading\nlectures and delivering stump speeches are very di\ufb00erent\nstyles of e\ufb00ort; and the most e\ufb00ective political orators often\nsurprise themselves as much as they do their audiences by\ntheir dryness and dreariness upon the platform of the\nlecturer. The facts of the matter are principally interesting\n as showing the natural drift of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s mind when\ndiverted from professional and political pursuits.\nThis diversion was only temporary. Mr. Lincoln had\nbecome a political man. Whatever may have been his\ninclinations at this time, he felt that he was in the hands of\nthe party to which he had just given the ripest and best\ne\ufb00orts of his life. He was a representative man, and was\nalready regarded by the great masses of the new party at\nthe West as their best man for the next presidential\ncampaign. His senatorial contest had done much to make\nhis name known to the politicians of the nation. Political\nmen everywhere had read his masterly debates with\nSenator Douglas, and had given him his position among the\nbest politicians and most notable political orators of the\ntime. While this is true, it is also true that east of the\nAlleghanies he was not much known among the people. He\nhad not been much in public o\ufb00ice; and his \ufb01eld of action\nand in\ufb02uence was so distant that they had heard but little\nabout him. If they had been told that within two years\nAbraham Lincoln would be elected president of the United\nStates, three out of every four would have inquired who\nAbraham Lincoln was. At the West all was di\ufb00erent.\nEverybody knew \u201cOld Abe.\u201d He was the people\u2019s friend \u2014\nthe man of the people \u2014 the champion of freedom and free\nlabor \u2014 the man who had beaten the \u201clittle giant\u201d in the\npopular vote of the democratic state of Illinois. His\npeculiarities were as well known to the people of the West\nas if he had been the member of every man\u2019s family. To look\nupon him was to look upon a lion. To shake hands with him\n or to hear him speak, was a great privilege \u2014 a subject of\nself-gratulation or neighborly boasting.\nOn the th of May, , we \ufb01nd Mr. Lincoln answering\na letter addressed to him by Dr. Theodor Canisius, a\nGerman citizen of Illinois, who, with an eye to the future,\ninquired \nconcerning \nMr. \nLincoln\u2019s \nviews \nof \nthe\nconstitutional provision recently adopted in Massachusetts,\nin relation to naturalized citizens, and whether he opposed\nor favored a fusion of the republicans and other opposition\nelements in the approaching campaign of . Mr. Lincoln\nreplied that, while he had no right to advise the sovereign\nand independent state of Massachusetts, concerning her\npolicy, he would say that so far as he understood the\nprovision she had consummated, he was against its\nadoption in Illinois, and in every other place where he had\na right to oppose it. \u201cAs I understand the spirit of our\ninstitutions,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln, \u201cit is designed to promote\nthe elevation of men. I am, therefore, hostile to anything\nthat tends to their debasement. It is well known that I\ndeplore the depressed condition of the blacks, and it would,\ntherefore, be very inconsistent for me to look with approval\nupon any measure that infringes upon the inalienable rights\nof white men, whether or not they are born in another land,\nor speak a di\ufb00erent language from our own.\u201d As to the\ninquiry touching the fusion of all the opposition elements,\nhe was in favor of it, if it could be done on republican\nprinciples; and upon no other condition. \u201cA fusion upon any\nother platform,\u201d the letter proceeds, \u201cwould be as insane as\nunprincipled. It would thereby lose the whole North, while\n the common enemy would still have the support of the\nentire South. The question in relation to men is di\ufb00erent.\nThere are good and patriotic men and able statesmen in the\nSouth whom I would willingly support, if they would place\nthemselves on republican ground; but I shall oppose the\nlowering of the republican standard even by a hair\u2019s\nbreadth.\u201d\nIt is to be remembered in this connection that\nMassachusetts was a representative republican state, and,\nregarding the ignorant foreign population, particularly of\nthe eastern states, as holding the balance of power\nbetween the democratic and republican parties, which it\nnever failed to exercise in the interest of the former and in\nthe support of African slavery, had instituted measures\nwhich rendered naturalization a more di\ufb00icult process. This\nembarrassed the republicans of the West, who were\nassociated with a large and generally intelligent German\npopulation, with leanings toward the republican party\nrather than to the democratic. Hence this letter to Mr.\nLincoln and his reply, which latter undoubtedly had its\no\ufb00ice in shaping public opinion, and in bringing the foreign\npopulation of the West into hearty sympathy with Mr.\nLincoln himself.\nIt was during this year that the movement for making Mr.\nLincoln the republican candidate for the presidency took\nform. He was present as a spectator at the Illinois state\nrepublican convention held at Decatur on the tenth of May.\nWhen he entered the hall, he was greeted with such\nenthusiasm as few defeated men are favored with. There\n was no mistaking the high honor and warm a\ufb00ection in\nwhich the audience held him, and no doubting the fact that\nthey regarded that which was nominally his defeat as a\ngreat triumph, whose fruits would not long be delayed. He\nhad hardly taken his seat when Governor Oglesby of\nDecatur announced that an old democrat of Macon County\ndesired to make a contribution to the convention. The o\ufb00er\nbeing at once accepted, two old fence-rails were borne into\nthe convention, gaudily decorated, and bearing the\ninscription: \u201cAbraham Lincoln, the rail candidate for the\npresidency in . Two rails from a lot of three thousand,\nmade in , by Thomas Hanks and Abe Lincoln \u2014 whose\nfather was the \ufb01rst pioneer of Macon County.\u201d\nThe e\ufb00ect of this upon an audience already excited can\nbe imagined by those only who have been familiar with the\ne\ufb00ect of similar melo dramatic incidents under similar\ncircumstances. The cheers were prolonged for \ufb01fteen\nminutes, or until the strength of the enthusiastic assembly\nwas exhausted. Mr. Lincoln was called upon to explain the\nmatter of the rails, which he did, repeating the story\nalready in the reader\u2019s possession \u2014 the story of his \ufb01rst\nwork in Illinois, when he helped to build a cabin for his\nfather, and to fence in a \ufb01eld of corn.\nIt is the misfortune of great men who are candidates for\no\ufb00ice, that appeals must be made by them, or on their\nbehalf, to the groundlings. It was a great misfortune to Mr.\nLincoln that he was introduced to the nation as pre-\neminently a rail-splitter, and that it was deemed necessary\nto his political fortunes that he should be called such. There\n is no question that the designation belittled him in the eyes\nof all people of education and culture, at home and abroad.\nAnd this, not because there was any prejudice among these\npeople against labor, and not because they attached the\nslightest dishonor to Mr. Lincoln on account of his early\npoverty and humble pursuits. Splitting rails was in no way\nallied to the duties of the presidency. The ability to split\nrails did not add to moral or intellectual power. The fact\nthat Mr. Lincoln had split rails did not increase his\nquali\ufb01cations for o\ufb00ice. Mr. Lincoln himself regretted that,\nwhile he was splitting these rails, he had not been in school\nor college. He felt that he should have been very much\nbetter \ufb01tted for the great duties that had been devolved\nupon him if, instead having devoted the best of his youth to\nsplitting rails and other manual labor, he had enjoyed the\nadvantages of a thorough education. The country took Mr.\nLincoln at the estimate of his friends; and those friends\nthrust him before the country as a man whose grand\nachievement was the splitting of many rails. It took years\nfor the country to learn that Mr. Lincoln was not a boor. It\ntook years for them to unlearn what an unwise and boyish\nintroduction of a great man to the public had taught them.\nIt took years for them to comprehend the fact that in Mr.\nLincoln the country had the wisest, truest, gentlest,\nnoblest, most sagacious president who had occupied the\nchair of state since Washington retired from it. At this very\nperiod he said to Judge Drummond of Chicago, who had\nremarked to him that people were talking of him for the\npresidency: \u201cIt seems as if they ought to \ufb01nd somebody\n who knows more than I do.\u201d The rails and that which they\nsymbolized were what troubled him, and, in his own\njudgment, detracted from his quali\ufb01cations for the high\no\ufb00ice.\nThe latter part of  and the \ufb01rst months of  were\nbroken by travel through various portions of the country,\nduring which he delivered some of the best and most\nelaborate speeches of his life. He visited Kansas, and was\nreceived by her people with the honor due to one who had\ndone \nbrave \nbattle \nfor \nher \nfreedom. \nOn \nentering\nLeavenworth, although the weather was most inclement, he\nwas met by a large procession of people, and escorted to\nhis hotel, while a dense crowd gathered upon the sidewalks\nthat lined the passage. All the doors, windows, balconies\nand porticos were \ufb01lled with men, women and children,\nanxious to catch a glimpse of the man whose speeches they\nhad read, and of whom they had heard so much. The\nLeavenworth Register, in its notice of the occasion, said:\u2014\n\u201cnever did man receive such honors at the hands of our\npeople, and never did our people pay honors to a better\nman, or one who has been a truer friend of Kansas.\u201d Here\nhe made a speech, and the following paragraph, selected\nfrom it, will show the state of political feeling at the time,\nand Mr. Lincoln\u2019s relation to it:\n\u201cBut you democrats are for the Union; and you greatly\nfear the success of the republicans would destroy the\nUnion. Why? Do the republicans declare against the Union?\nNothing like it. Your own statement of it is that if the black\nrepublicans elect a president, you \u2018wont stand it.\u2019 You will\n break up the Union. That will be your act, not ours. To\njustify it, you must show that our policy gives you just\ncause for such desperate action. Can you do that? When\nyou attempt it, you will \ufb01nd that our policy is exactly the\npolicy of the men who made the Union \u2014 nothing more,\nnothing less. Do you really think you are justi\ufb01ed to break\nup the government rather than have it administered as it\nwas by Washington? If you do, you are very unreasonable,\nand more reasonable men cannot and will not submit to\nyou. While you elect presidents, we submit, neither\nbreaking nor attempting to break up the Union. If we shall\nconstitutionally elect a president, it will be our duty to see\nthat you also submit. Old John Brown has been executed for\ntreason against a state. We cannot object, even though he\nagreed with us in thinking slavery wrong. That cannot\nexcuse violence, bloodshed and treason. It could avail him\nnothing that he might think himself right. So, if we\nconstitutionally elect a president, and, therefore, you\nundertake to destroy the Union, it will be our duty to deal\nwith you as old John Brown has been dealt with. We shall\ntry to do our duty. We hope and believe that in no section\nwill a majority so act as to render such extreme measures\nnecessary.\u201d\nIn September, Mr. Lincoln paid a visit to Ohio, following\nMr. Douglas, and made two speeches, one at Columbus and\nanother at Cincinnati. These were the \ufb01rst occasions on\nwhich he had ever had the privilege of speaking to Ohio\naudiences, and the introductions to these speeches\nbetrayed his di\ufb00idence. In Illinois the people knew and\n understood him. He had won a reputation there, but, as he\ntraveled eastward, he felt himself away from home. The\nnames of Chase, Corwin and Wade were in his mind \u2014\neminent speakers, with whose voices the people of Ohio\nwere familiar \u2014 and he felt that it would be di\ufb00icult for him\nto establish his position as a political orator when brought\nin close comparison with them. His style of speech and\nmode of reasoning he knew to be his own; and he had\nmisgivings touching their reception among those whose\nideas of oratory were derived from other models. But these\nmisgivings were groundless. His plainness, clearness,\nearnestness and thorough comprehension of the merits of\nhis subject secured for him the honest admiration and\nesteem of all who heard him.\nAt Columbus, he devoted himself mainly to the discussion\nof a few points of an elaborate article that had previously\nappeared in Harper\u2019s Magazine, from the pen of Judge\nDouglas. In this article, the Senator had contrived to\nspread throughout the country his views touching the\nrelations of slavery to the Constitution. It was the old talk\nof the senatorial campaign repeated with unimportant\nvariations, though with some new illustrations. It was\nfamiliar ground with Mr. Lincoln; and, while his speech was\na new one, it would convey but few new ideas to those who\nhad read his speeches of the previous autumn. Mr. Douglas\nhad preceded him at Cincinnati, and had alluded to him\nthere. It was the battle of Illinois repeated upon the soil of\nOhio. The contestants were the same \u2014 the questions upon\nwhich they took issue were the same. Popular sovereignty,\n the Dred Scott decision, the right and wrong of slavery,\nnegro equality, the nationalization of slavery \u2014 these\nsubjects, presented and illustrated in every possible way\nalready, were again made the themes of discussion by these\ntwo men; and the people of Ohio gave them abundant\naudience. One of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s most e\ufb00ective points at\nCincinnati was made upon the assumption that, being near\nthe Kentucky border, some Kentuckians were present, to\nwhom he addressed himself in an attempt to prove that\nthey ought to nominate Judge Douglas at Charleston, as\npeculiarly the southern candidate for the presidency. He\ntold them that Judge Douglas was the only man in the\nwhole nation who gave them any hold of the free states;\nand then he proceeded to show that Mr. Douglas was as\nsincerely, and quite as wisely, for them, as they were for\nthemselves. The points made in this part of the speech\nagainst his old antagonist were very ingenious and very\ndamaging, so far as they related to his standing in Ohio,\nwhatever e\ufb00ect they may have had upon the possible\nKentuckians in the audience. After telling them that they\nmust take Douglas under any circumstance. or be defeated,\nand that it was possible, if they did take him, that they\nmight be beaten, he told them what the opposition\nproposed to do with them in case it should be successful in\nthe approaching presidential contest. The passage is worth\nquoting, as it is an embodiment of the policy he\nsubsequently \npursued \nwhen, \nthe \nopposition \nhaving\nsucceeded, \nhe \nfound \nhimself \nendowed \nwith \nthe\n responsibilities of o\ufb00ice, as well as a prophecy of the result\nof a collision then conditionally proposed.\n\u201cI will tell you, so far as I am authorized to speak for the\nopposition, what we mean to do with you. We mean to treat\nyou, as near as we possibly can, as Washington, Je\ufb00erson\nand Madison treated you. We mean to leave you alone, and\nin no way to interfere with your institution; to abide by all\nand every compromise of the Constitution, and, in a word,\ncoming back to the original proposition, to treat you, so far\nas degenerated men (if we have degenerated) may,\naccording to the examples of those noble fathers \u2014\nWashington, Je\ufb00erson and Madison. We mean to remember\nthat you are as good as we; that there is no di\ufb00erence\nbetween us other than the di\ufb00erence of circumstances. We\nmean to recognize and bear in mind always that you have\nas good hearts in your bosoms as other people, or as we\nclaim to have, and treat you accordingly. We mean to marry\nyour girls when we have a chance \u2014 the white ones I mean\n\u2014 and I have the honor to inform you that I once did have a\nchance in that way.\n\u201cI have told you what we mean to do. I want to know, now,\nwhen that thing takes place, what you mean to do. I often\nhear it intimated that you mean to divide the Union\nwhenever a republican or anything like it is elected\npresident of the United States. [A voice\u2014 \u2018That is so.\u2019] \u2018That\nis so,\u2019 one of them says; I wonder if he is a Kentuckian? [A\nvoice\u2014 \u2018He is a Douglas man.\u2019] Well, then, I want to know\nwhat you are going to do with your half of it? Are you going\n to split the Ohio down through, and push your half o\ufb00 a\npiece? Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us\noutrageous fellows? Or are you going to build up a wall\nsome way between your country and ours, by which that\nmovable property of yours can\u2019t come over here any more,\nto the danger of your losing it? Do you think you can better\nyourselves on that subject, by leaving us here under no\nobligation whatever to return those specimens of your\nmovable property that come hither? You have divided the\nUnion because we would not do right with you, as you\nthink, upon that subject; when we cease to be under\nobligations to do anything for you, how much better o\ufb00 do\nyou think you will be? Will you make war upon us and kill\nus all? Why, gentlemen, I think you are as gallant and as\nbrave men as live; that you can \ufb01ght as bravely in a good\ncause, man for man, as any other people living; that you\nhave shown yourselves capable of this upon various\noccasions; but man for man, you are not better than we are,\nand there are not so many of you as there are of us. You\nwill never make much of a hand at whipping us. If we were\nfewer in numbers than you, I think that you could whip us;\nif we were equal it would likely be a drawn battle; but\nbeing inferior in numbers, you will make nothing by\nattempting to master us.\u201d\nIt is proper to say of Mr. Lincoln and Judge Douglas that\nno two men in the nation better apprehended the real\nnature of the struggle between the North and South than\nthey. Mr. Douglas, so far back as the date of the abrogation\nof the Missouri Compromise, foresaw the coming con\ufb02ict,\n and by that measure attempted to avert it. His bringing\nforward that measure at a time when the South did not\ndemand it, could have been from no motive other than his\nwish to provide ground upon which the northern and\nsouthern \ndemocracy \ncould \nstand \ntogether, \nin \nthe\npresidential contest of , when it was his expectation to\nbe their candidate. Slavery was becoming discontented\nunder the conviction that it was about to lose its power. It\nfound itself either legally or practically shut out of the\nnational domain. It is not at all improbable that the Senator\nknew something of the intrigues of those who were bent on\ndisunion. \nIt \nwas \nthen \nthat \nhe \ninvented \n\u201cpopular\nsovereignty\u201d \u2014 what he was accustomed to call his \u201cgreat\nprinciple\u201d \u2014 and there was indeed nothing foolish in the\ntenacity with which he clung to it. It was his only ground of\nhope for election to the presidency. He had no personal\nresponsibility for the Dred Scott decision. It was not for\nhim to say what the rights of slavery were among the\npeople of a territory; but he was willing to take the\nresponsibility of giving slavery and freedom the same\nrights. There was great plausibility in his view, and he had\nlittle di\ufb00iculty in carrying his party with him. It was a sort\nof neutral ground \u2014 speciously it was catholic ground. His\nintention was to give slavery a chance to enter territory\nthen free, \u2014 territory forever set apart to freedom. If he did\nnot intend to give this chance, his movement was without\nmotive. On this chance, he intended, without doubt, to\nbuild up a claim upon southern support; but he had a heavy\nload to carry, as events proved. Mr. Lincoln was a thorn in\n his side. If he spoke in Illinois, Mr. Lincoln challenged him\nto debate, and exposed his fallacies. If he went to Ohio, Mr.\nLincoln followed close upon his heels. If he betook himself\nto a New York publication, Mr. Lincoln took measures\npractically to meet him there.\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s opportunity to meet his antagonist in the\npress of New York came through an invitation to speak in\nBrooklyn, at Mr. Beecher\u2019s church. This speech, which it\nwas \ufb01nally concluded should be delivered at the Cooper\nInstitute, in New York, was by many regarded as the best\nhe ever made. It was the last elaborate speech of his life,\nand was spread broadcast over the country by the press of\nthe city.\nMr. Lincoln arrived in the great metropolis on the th of\nFebruary, . He expected, as has been stated, to speak\nat Mr. Beecher\u2019s church in Brooklyn, and had prepared his\naddress with some reference to the place. On learning that\nhe was expected to speak in New York, he said he must\nreview his speech. He reached the Astor House on\nSaturday, and spent the whole day in making such\nmodi\ufb01cations of his manuscript as seemed necessary, under\nthe change of circumstances. On Sunday, he attended upon\nMr. Beecher\u2019s preaching, and seemed to take great\nsatisfaction in the services. When waited upon on Monday,\nby representative members of the Republican Club, under\nwhose auspices he was to appear, he was found encased in\na new and badly wrinkled suit of black, which had evidently\nspent too much time in a small valise. He talked freely of\nthe unbecoming dress, and, like a boy, expressed his\n surprise at \ufb01nding himself in the great city. On being\napplied to for slips containing the speech of the evening, he\nshowed that he was not familiar with the habit of eastern\nspeakers of supplying such slips to the press in advance,\nand even expressed the doubt whether any of the papers\nwould care to publish it entire. During the interview, he\nreferred frequently to Mr. Douglas, and in so kind and\ncordial a manner that it was impossible to regard him as\nthat gentleman\u2019s personal enemy in any sense.\nBeing at leisure during the day, he accepted an invitation\nto ride about the city. Some of the more important streets\nwere \npassed \nthrough, \nand \na \nnumber \nof \nlarge\nestablishments visited. At one place, he met an old\nacquaintance from Illinois, whom he addressed with an\ninquiry as to how he had fared since leaving the West. \u201cI\nhave made a hundred thousand dollars, and lost all,\u201d was\nhis reply. Then turning questioner he said: \u201cHow is it with\nyou, Mr. Lincoln?\u201d \u201cOh very well,\u201d said he; \u201cI have the\ncottage at Spring\ufb01eld, and about eight thousand dollars in\nmoney. If they make me vice-president with Seward, as\nsome say they will, I hope I shall be able to increase it to\ntwenty thousand; and that is as much as any man ought to\nwant.\u201d\nIn a photographic establishment on Broadway, he met\nand was introduced to George Bancroft, the historian. The\ncontrast which he presented in his person and manner to\nthis gentleman was certainly not to his advantage; but his\nblu\ufb00, hearty way carried all before it. He informed Mr.\nBancroft that he was on his way to Massachusetts where he\n had a son in college, who, if report were true, already knew\nmuch more than his father.\nHe was to speak at Cooper Institute that night, and\nhaving caught a glimpse of the great capital and of its\ngigantic interests and a\ufb00airs, it is not strange that he\nshould have been oppressed with a sense of his own\ninsigni\ufb01cance. It was one of his peculiarities that, while he\nwas the subject of the most exalted aspirations and\nambitions, and the ready undertaker of the highest and\nmost di\ufb00icult tasks, he always bore about with him a sense\nof his imperfections, and experienced a sort of surprise at\nevery success. Indeed, his triumphs became the subjects of\nhis \nstudy. \nThey \nreally \npuzzled \nhim; \nand \nfrequent\nconversations with others betrayed his desire to \ufb01nd the\nsecrets of his own power.\nBut Mr. Lincoln was not more curious concerning\nhimself, or concerning the new scenes among which he\nfound himself, than the people of New York were\nconcerning him. There was a great and general curiosity to\nsee and hear him; and when he entered the hall he found\nthe platform covered with the republican leaders of the city,\nand of Brooklyn, and, in his audience, many ladies. The\nvenerable \nWilliam \nCullen \nBryant \npresided, \nand \nin\nintroducing the speaker said: \u201cIt is a grateful o\ufb00ice that I\nperform, in introducing to you an eminent citizen of the\nWest, hitherto known to you only by reputation.\u201d There was\nnothing in the introduction, however, which pleased Mr.\nLincoln so much as Mr. Bryant\u2019s statement in the next day\u2019s\nEvening Post, (of which he was the editor) that for the\n publication of such words of weight and wisdom as those of\nMr. Lincoln, the pages of that journal were \u201cinde\ufb01nitely\nelastic.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln began his address in a low, monotonous tone,\nbut gaining con\ufb01dence in the respectful stillness, his tones,\nthat had long been keyed to out-of-door e\ufb00orts, rose in\nstrength and gained in clearness, until every ear heard\nevery word. His style of speech was so fresh, his mode of\nstatement was so simple, his illustrations were so quaint\nand peculiar, that the audience eagerly drank in every\nsentence. The backwoods orator had found one of the most\nappreciative audiences he had ever addressed, and the\naudience gave abundant testimony that they were listening\nto the utterances of a master.\nThe speech which Mr. Lincoln made on this occasion\nmust have cost him much labor in the preparation. The\nhistorical study which it involved \u2014 study that led into\nunexplored \ufb01elds, and \ufb01elds very di\ufb00icult of exploration \u2014\nmust have been very great; but it was intimate and\ncomplete. Gentlemen who afterward engaged in preparing\nthe speech for circulation as a campaign document were\nmuch surprised by the amount of research that it required\nto be able to make the speech, and were very much\nwearied with the work of verifying its historical statements\nin detail. They were weeks in \ufb01nding the works consulted\nby him.\nAs a text for the subject of his discourse, he took the\nwords of Senator Douglas, uttered in a speech at\nColumbus, Ohio, the previous autumn, viz: \u201cOur fathers\n when they framed the government under which we live,\nunderstood this question (the question of slavery) just as\nwell, and even better, than we do now.\u201d To this statement\nthe speaker agreed, so that he and the senator had a\ncommon starting point for discussion. The inquiry was,\nsimply: what was the understanding those then had of the\nquestion mentioned? As questions preliminary to this\ninquiry he gave these: \u201cwhat is the frame of government\nunder which we live?\u201d and \u201cwho were our fathers who\nframed the Constitution?\u201d The frame of government is the\nConstitution itself, consisting of the original, framed in\n, and twelve subsequent amendments, ten of which\nwere framed in . The thirty-nine men who framed the\noriginal Constitution are legitimately to be called the\nfathers, and these he took as \u201cour fathers who framed the\ngovernment under which We live.\u201d The question fully\nwritten out, which Senator Douglas thought these men\nunderstood better than we do, was: \u201cDoes the proper\ndivision of local from federal authority, or anything in the\nConstitution, forbid the federal government control as to\nslavery in our federal territories?\u201d\nFrom this point Mr. Lincoln went on to draw from the\nhistory of Congress every recorded act of these thirty-nine\nmen on the question of slavery. Question after question\nupon which these men acted was stated in brief; and it was\nfound that, of the thirty-nine fathers, twenty-one, a clear\nmajority, so acted that they would be guilty of perjury if\nthey did not believe that the federal government had power\nto control slavery in the territories. Two voted against\n special measures, but in such a way as not to show whether\nthey believed the government possessed this power or not.\nOf the remaining sixteen, there is no record, but it is fair to\nconclude they had the same understanding with the\nmajority, particularly as they included some of the most\nnoted anti-slavery men of the time, among whom were\nBenjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton and Gouverneur\nMorris.\nThe historical argument was entirely unanswerable. It\nwas a solid and logical statement of facts and conclusions\nthat no sane man would undertake to controvert. The \ufb01rst\nthird of the speech was devoted to this historical argument,\nand the remainder in about equal proportions to addresses\nto the southern people, and to the republicans. His remarks\naddressed particularly to the South were in the kindest\nspirit, but they were charged with a force of argument and\nstatement that is wonderful. It is well that Mr. Lincoln be\npermitted. to state his own attitude toward those to whom\nhe was destined to come into such strange and momentous\nrelations. He said:\n\u201cYou say we are sectional. We deny it. That makes an\nissue; and the burden of proof is upon you. You produce\nyour proof; and what is it? Why, that our party has no\nexistence in your section \u2014 gets no votes in your section.\nThe fact is substantially true; but does it prove the issue? If\nit does, then, in case we should, without change of\nprinciple, begin to get votes in your section, we should\nthereby cease to be sectional. You cannot escape this\nconclusion; and yet, are you willing to abide by it? If you\n are, you will probably soon \ufb01nd that we have ceased to be\nsectional, for we shall get votes in your section this very\nyear. You will then begin to discover, as the truth plainly is,\nthat your proof does not touch the issue. The fact that we\nget no votes in your section is a fact of your making, and\nnot of ours. And if there be fault in that fact, that fault is\nprimarily yours, and remains so until you show that we\nrepel you by some wrong principle or practice. If we do\nrepel you by any wrong principle or practice, the fault is\nours; but this brings us to where you ought to have started\n\u2014 to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle. If\nour principle, put in practice, would wrong your section for\nthe bene\ufb01t of ours, or for any other object, then our\nprinciple, and we with it, are sectional, and are justly\nopposed and denounced as such. Meet us, then, on the\nquestion of whether our principle, put in practice, would\nwrong your section; and so meet it as if it were possible\nthat something may be said on our side. Do you accept the\nchallenge? No? Then you really believe that the principle\nwhich our fathers, who framed the government under\nwhich we live, thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and\nindorse it again and again upon their o\ufb00icial oaths, is, in\nfact, so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation\nwithout a moment\u2019s consideration.\n\u201cSome of you delight to \ufb02aunt in our faces the warning\nagainst sectional parties given by Washington in his\nFarewell Address. Less than eight years before Washington\ngave that warning, he had, as President of the United\nStates, approved and signed an act of Congress enforcing\n the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory,\nwhich act embodied the policy of the government upon that\nsubject, up to and at the very moment he penned that\nwarning; and about one year after he penned it he wrote\nLafayette that he considered that prohibition a wise\nmeasure, expressing, in the same connection, his hope that\nwe should some time have a confederacy of free states.\n\u201cBearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has\nsince arisen upon this same subject, is that warning a\nweapon in your hands against us, or in our hands against\nyou? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast the\nblame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy,\nor upon you, who repudiate it? We respect that warning of\nWashington, and we commend it to you, together with his\nexample pointing to the right application of it.\n\u201cBut you say you are conservative \u2014 eminently\nconservative \u2014 while we are revolutionary, destructive, or\nsomething of the sort. What is conservatism? Is it not\nadherence to the old and tried against the new and\nuntried? We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on\nthe point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers\nwho framed the government under which we live; while\nyou, with one accord, reject, and scout, and spit upon that\nold policy, and insist upon substituting something new.\nTrue, you disagree among yourselves as to what that\nsubstitute shall be. You have considerable variety of new\npropositions and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting\nand denouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some of you\nare for reviving the foreign slave-trade; some for a\n congressional slave-code for the territories; some for\nCongress forbidding the territories to prohibit slavery\nwithin their limits; some for maintaining slavery in the\nterritories through the Judiciary; some for the \u2018gur-reat\npur-rinciple\u2019 that, \u2018if one man would enslave another, no\nthird man should object,\u2019 fantastically called \u2018popular\nsovereignty;\u2019 but never a man among you in favor of federal\nprohibition of slavery in federal territories, according to the\npractice of our fathers who framed the government under\nwhich we live. Not one of all your various plans can show a\nprecedent or an advocate in the century within which our\ngovernment originated. Consider, then, whether your claim\nof conservatism for yourselves, and your charge of\ndestructiveness against us, are based on the most clear and\nstable foundations.\n\u201cAgain, you say we have made the slavery question more\nprominent than it formerly was. We deny it. We admit that\nit is more prominent, but we deny that we made it so. It\nwas not we, but you, who discarded the old policy of the\nfathers. We resisted, and still resist, your innovation; and\nthence comes the greater prominence of the question.\nWould you have that question reduced to its former\nproportions? Go back to that old policy. What has been will\nbe again, under the same conditions. If you would have the\npeace of the old times, re-adopt the precepts and policy of\nthe old times.\u201d\nAlluding to their threats to break up the Union if slavery\nshould be shut out of the territories, he said:\n \u201cIn that supposed event, you say you will destroy the\nUnion; and then you say the great crime of having\ndestroyed it will be upon us! That is cool. A highwayman\nholds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth:\n\u2018Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you will be a\nmurderer!\u2019 To be sure, what the robber demanded of me \u2014\nmy money \u2014 was my own; and I had a clear right to keep it;\nbut it was no more my own than my vote is my own; and\nthreat of death to me to extort my money, and threat of\ndestruction to the Union to extort my vote, can scarcely be\ndistinguished in principle.\u201d\nCertainly this illustration disposed of the whole question\nas to who would be responsible for the destruction of the\nUnion, under the circumstances stated.\nHis words to the republicans were words of profoundest\nwisdom. He told them that nothing would satisfy the South\nbut to cease calling slavery wrong, and to join with them in\ncalling it right, and to do it thoroughly by acts as well as\nwords. \u201cWe must arrest and return their slaves with greedy\npleasure. We must pull down our free state constitutions.\nThe whole atmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of\nopposition to slavery, before they will cease to believe that\nall their troubles proceed from us.\u201d He continued: \u201cI am\nquite aware they do not state their case precisely in this\nway. Most of them would probably say to us, \u2018let us alone,\ndo nothing to us, and say what you please about slavery.\u2019\nBut we do let them alone \u2014 have never disturbed them \u2014\nso that, after all, it is what we say that dissatis\ufb01es them.\nThey will continue to accuse us of doing until we cease\n saying.\u201d After saying that we could not consistently deny\nthe South in its most extreme demands, on any ground\nexcept the wrong of slavery, he put the case forcibly, as\nfollows: \u201cIf slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and\nconstitutions against it are themselves wrong, and should\nbe silenced and swept away. If it is right, we cannot justly\nobject to its nationality \u2014 its universality; if it is wrong,\nthey \ncannot \njustly \ninsist \nupon \nits \nextension, \nits\nenlargement. All they ask, we could readily grant if we\nthought slavery right; all we ask, they could as readily\ngrant if they thought slavery wrong. Their thinking it right\nand our thinking it wrong is the precise fact upon which\ndepends the whole controversy.\u201d The closing paragraph is\nequally remarkable for its wit and wisdom \u2014 its pith and\npatriotism:\n\u201cWrong as we think slavery is, we can yet a\ufb00ord to let it\nalone where is is, because that much is due to the necessity\narising from its actual presence in the nation; but can we,\nwhile our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread into the\nnational territories, and to overrun us here in these free\nstates? If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by\nour duty, fearlessly and e\ufb00ectively. Let us be diverted by\nnone of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so\nindustriously plied and belabored \u2014 contrivances such as\ngroping for some middle ground between the right and the\nwrong, vain as the search for a man who should be neither\na living man nor a dead man \u2014 such a policy of \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019\non a question about which all true men do care \u2014 such as\nUnion appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to\n disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and calling not the\nsinners, \nbut \nthe \nrighteous \nto \nrepentance-such \nas\ninvocations to Washington, imploring men to unsay what\nWashington said, and undo what Washington did. Neither\nlet us be slandered from our duty by false accusations\nagainst us, nor frightened from it by menaces of\ndestruction to the Government, nor of dungeons to\nourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might, and in\nthat faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty, as we\nunderstand it.\u201d\nThe speech was, in the popular acceptation of the\nphrase, a great success. Through all his passages of close\nand crowded reasoning, his audience followed him with an\ninterest that produced the profoundest silence, and at\nevery triumphant establishment of a point broke out into\nsudden and hearty applause. Those who came from motives\nof curiosity went away thoughtful. Many who had entered\nthe hall in doubt as to their duty, went away with their path\nbright before them. Most of all were the New York\npoliticians a\ufb00ected; and it is not to be doubted that the\nimpressions of that evening left them convinced that if Mr.\nSeward, the man of their choice, should be set aside, as the\nrepublican candidate for the presidency, Mr. Lincoln, the\nfavorite of the West, would be abundantly worthy of their\nsupport.\nAt the conclusion of the speech, a few friends took the\nspeaker to the rooms of the Atheneum Club for supper. Mr.\nLincoln appreciated his success, and was in good humor\nover it. He was as happy at the table as he was upon the\n platform \u2014 full of good humor, and abounding with jokes\nand pleasant stories. Throwing o\ufb00 all reserve, and opening\nhis heart like a boy, he talked long and late; and when he\nparted with his friends for the night they were as much\ncharmed with the man as they had been instructed by his\nspeech and entertained by his conversation.\nThe papers of the city were full of his address and with\ncomments upon it the next day. The Illinois lawyer was a\nlion. Critics read the speech, and marveled at its pure and\ncompact English, its felicity of statement and its faultless\nlogic. It was read during the day not only by New York but\nby nearly all New England.\nAfter the speech, he spent several days in New York,\nfamiliarizing himself with its wonders. Some of his\nexplorations he made alone, and on one occasion found his\nway into the Sunday School of the Five Points Mission. The\nsuperintendent noticing his look of interest in the\nproceedings, invited him to speak to the children. His\nremarks interested his young audience so much that on\nevery attempt to stop they cried out \u201cgo on, oh! do go on!\u201d\nNone knew who he was, and as he turned to depart, the\nsuperintendent inquired his name. \u201cAbraham Lincoln of\nIllinois,\u201d was the answer.\nInvitations were received by Mr. Lincoln from many\nplaces in New England, to speak on political questions. On\nthe \ufb01fth of March, he spoke at Hartford, in the city hall,\nand was escorted to the hall by the \ufb01rst company of \u201cWide-\nAwakes\u201d ever organized in the country. This organization\nbecame universal throughout the free states, but was\n intended only for campaign service. He had an immense\naudience in Hartford, and produced a powerful impression.\nOn the following day he was waited upon by a number of\nprominent citizens, and visited several objects of interest in\nthe city, among which were the armories of Colt and Sharp.\nOn the sixth of March, he spoke at New Haven, at Meriden\non the seventh, at Woonsocket, Rhode Island, on the eighth,\nat Norwich, Connecticut, on the ninth, and at Bridgeport on\nthe tenth. His speaking was always to immense audiences.\nConnecticut was that year carried by the republicans by\nabout \ufb01ve hundred majority, against the most powerful\ne\ufb00orts of the democrats \u2014 a fact which was due more to\nthe speeches of Mr. Lincoln than to any other cause.\nSome very interesting reminiscences of this trip were\ncommunicated to the public in , by Rev. John P.\nGulliver of Norwich, who listened to his address in that city.\nOn the morning following the speech, he met Mr. Lincoln\nupon a train of cars, and entered into conversation with\nhim. In speaking of his speech, Mr. Gulliver remarked to\nMr. Lincoln that he thought it the most remarkable one he\never heard. \u201cAre you sincere in what you say?\u201d inquired Mr.\nLincoln. \u201cI mean every word of it,\u201d replied the minister.\n\u201cIndeed, sir,\u201d he continued, \u201cI learned more of the art of\npublic speaking last evening than I could from a whole\ncourse of lectures on rhetoric.\u201d Then Mr. Lincoln informed\nhim of \u201ca most extraordinary circumstance\u201d that occurred\nat New Haven a few days previously. A professor of rhetoric\nin Yale College, he had been told, came to hear him, took\nnotes of his speech, and gave a lecture on it to his class the\n following day; and, not satis\ufb01ed with that, followed him to\nMeriden the next evening, and heard him again for the\nsame purpose. All this seemed to Mr. Lincoln to be \u201cvery\nextraordinary.\u201d He had been su\ufb00iciently astonished by his\nsuccess at the West, but he had no expectation of any\nmarked success at the East, particularly among literary and\nlearned men. \u201cNow,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln, \u201cI should like very\nmuch to know what it was in my speech which you thought\nso remarkable, and which interested my friend the\nprofessor so much?\u201d Mr. Gulliver\u2019s answer was: \u201cThe\nclearness of your statements, the unanswerable style of\nyour reasoning, and, especially, your illustrations, which\nwere romance and pathos and fun and logic all welded\ntogether.\u201d\nAfter Mr. Gulliver had fully satis\ufb01ed his curiosity by a\nfurther exposition of the politician\u2019s peculiar power, Mr.\nLincoln said, \u201cI am much obliged to you for this. I have\nbeen wishing for a long time to \ufb01nd some one who would\nmake this analysis for me. It throws light on a subject\nwhich has been dark to me. I can understand very readily\nhow such a power as you have ascribed to me will account\nfor the e\ufb00ect which seems to be produced by my speeches.\nI hope you have not been too \ufb02attering in your estimate.\nCertainly I have had a most wonderful success for a man of\nmy limited education.\u201d Then Mr. Gulliver inquired into the\nprocesses by which he had acquired his education, and was\nrewarded with many interesting details. When they were\nabout to part, the minister said: \u201cMr. Lincoln, may I say one\nthing to you before we separate?\u201d \u201cCertainly; anything you\n please,\u201d was the response. \u201cYou have just spoken,\u201d said Mr.\nGulliver, \u201cof the tendency of political life in Washington to\ndebase the moral convictions of our representatives there,\nby the admixture of considerations of mere political\nexpediency. You have become, by the controversy with Mr.\nDouglas, one of our leaders in this great struggle with\nslavery, which is undoubtedly the struggle of the nation and\nthe age. What I would like to say is this, and I say it with a\nfull heart: Be true to your principles, and we will be true to\nyou, and God will be true to us all.\u201d Mr. Lincoln, touched by\nthe earnestness of his interlocutor, took his hand in both of\nhis own, and, with his face full of sympathetic light,\nexclaimed: \u201cI say amen to that! amen to that!\u201d\nAfter visiting his son at Harvard College, making many\nacquaintances among the prominent men of New England,\nand looking with curious eyes upon New England scenes,\nand \nobserving \nwith \nhis \nnative \nshrewdness \nthe\ncharacteristics of New England habits and manners, he\nturned his face homewards, spending a Sabbath in New\nYork while on the way, and again attending Mr. Beecher\u2019s\nchurch.\nOne thing, at least, he had learned by this visit: that the\npeople of the older states judge a man by the same rule\nthat prevails on an Illinois prairie \u2014 by what he is, and\nwhat he can do, and not by the cloth he wears, the\nknowledge he has acquired, the wealth he possesses, or the\nblood that \ufb02ows in his veins. He had been accepted as an\nhonest, fresh, original and powerful man; and he went\nhome grati\ufb01ed. Could he have made his visit longer, and\n been seen more generally by the people, it would not have\nbeen necessary for them to wait so long before knowing\nhow great and good a man the providence of God had given\nto be their ruler.\n   ha ter   .\nTHE FREQUENT ALLUSIONS in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s speeches to\nthreats of secession on the part of the South, in the event of\nthe success of the republican party, have already shown the\nreader that secession had become a matter of consideration\nand discussion among those interested in the perpetuation\nand nationalization of slavery. It was evident that the\nsouthern leaders were preparing the minds of their people\nfor some desperate step, and that many of them desired,\nrather than deprecated, the election of a republican\npresident. Many of them openly said that they should\nprefer the election of Mr. Seward or Mr. Lincoln to the\nelection of Mr. Douglas, because then they should know\nexactly what they were to meet. The reason thus given was\nundoubtedly a fraud. They found themselves in desperate\ncircumstances. All their schemes for the extension of\nslavery and the reinforcement of the slave power had\nmiscarried. Kansas and California were lost to them. There\nwas no hope for them in Nebraska or any of the new\nterritories. The hope of acquiring Cuba was gone, and the\n\ufb01llibustering \noperations \nof \nWalker \nwhich \nthey \nhad\npatronized were failures. They knew of but one remedy \u2014\nthat which the great mischief-maker of South Carolina had\npointed out to them many years before, viz: secession. It is\ndoubtful whether they preferred secession to predominance\n in the nation, but, basing their policy on the doctrine of\n\u201cstate rights,\u201d their aim was to secede, and either to insist\non a permanent separation, or by secession to coerce the\ngovernment into the practical acknowledgment of their\nclaims. There is no doubt that it was the policy of the\nshrewdest of the slavery propagandists so to manage their\nparty as to secure the election of a republican president.\nOverpowered in the nation, and hopeless of the future, they\nlooked only for a plausible pretext for precipitating the\nexecution of their scheme; and this could only be found in\nthe election of a president professedly a foe to the\nextension of slavery.\n\u201cThe Knights of the Golden Circle\u201d were a band of secret\nconspirators organized in the interest of treason. The\npopular political leaders rose to the highest degrees in this\norder, and knew the whole plot, while the masses, many of\nwhom had no real sympathy with secession, were kept in\nthe dark, ready to be forced into measures that were in\ncunning and careful preparation. The Christian church of\nthe whole South was the willing slave of this cabal.\nPreachers proclaimed the divine right of slavery and the\ndoctrines of sedition from the pulpit. The press was an\nobedient instrument in their hands. There were traitors and\nplotters \nin \nthe \nnational \ngovernment, \nindustriously\npreparing the way for secession, and sapping the power of\nthe government to prevent it. Mr. Cobb was squandering\nthe national \ufb01nances. Mr. Floyd, the secretary of war, was\n\ufb01lling all the southern arsenals with arms at the expense of\nthe government, and sending loyal o\ufb00icers to distant posts;\n and, although a northern man was at the head of the navy\ndepartment, it was subsequently found, when ships were\nwanted, that they were very far from where they were\nwanted. These southern men, thus plotting, only waited for\na pretext for springing their plot upon the people, and of\ncourse were not reluctant to make a pretext when\nopportunity o\ufb00ered.\nThis was the condition of a\ufb00airs in the spring of , a\nyear which was to see a new president elected. Everybody\nfelt that a severe political storm was ahead, though\ncomparatively few, either at the North or the South, knew\nwhat its character would be. The South blindly followed its\nleaders, without perfectly knowing whither it was to be led.\nThe North had become accustomed to threats of dissolution\nof the Union, and did not believe that those then rife would\nbe better ful\ufb01lled than those which had preceded them. No\none at the North, unless it may have been a few\nsympathetic politicians, had any faith in the earnestness of\nthe pro-slavery schemers. The disruption of the government\nwas regarded as an impossibility; and the Union-loving\nYankee would not believe that there were any who would\npush their professed enmity to any practical exhibition.\nMr. Lincoln had scarcely returned to his home before the\nDemocratic National Convention assembled at Charleston.\nThis convention occurred on the twenty-third of April, and\ncollected to itself all the plotters against the Union. That\nthey met the northern members of the democratic party\nwith any expectation to unite with them in a platform and\nthe selection of a candidate, is not probable. Mr. Douglas,\n with his popular sovereignty, and Dred Scott decision, and\n\u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d policy, o\ufb00ered them the only ground of Union.\nAll saw this, and all were for or against Douglas. Douglas\nwas the pivot of the convention. Everything turned on him.\nThe northern men felt that nothing less than Douglas, who\nhad fought the Lecompton fraud and the administration,\nand had been compelled to some concessions to freedom in\norder to win his seat in the senate, would do for them,\nwhile the South was determined to take no man who was\nnot fairly and squarely a pro-slavery man, with a clean\nrecord, and to subscribe to no platform that did not accord\nto them fully the rights they claimed. The South would have\nonly a \u201csound man,\u201d and would \ufb01ght this time only \u201con\nprinciple.\u201d If it could not have honest victory, it wanted\ndefeat. No \u201cunfriendly legislation\u201d should exclude slavery\nfrom the territories. They must have their property\nprotected. Mr. Yancey was present as the leader of the\n\u201c\ufb01re-eaters,\u201d \nand \ncould \nprobably \nhave \nforetold \nthe\nexplosion of the convention. There is no doubt that he\nintended nothing else than this, and the convention did\nexplode, and the old democratic party that had proved\ninvincible on so many battle-\ufb01elds was rent in twain. The\nsouthern members, by a large majority, withdrew and\nformed \na \n\u201cConstitutional \nConvention.\u201d \nThe \nregular\nconvention remained in session, and after \ufb01fty-seven\nunsuccessful ballotings, in which Mr. Douglas came near a\nnomination, they gave it up, and adjourned to meet in\nBaltimore on the eighteenth day of June, or two days after\nthe appointed date of the Republican Convention at\n Chicago. The Constitutional Convention transacted no\nimportant \nbusiness, \nand \nmade \nno \nnomination, \nbut\nadjourned to meet in Richmond on the second Monday in\nJune.\nThe Charleston people were delighted with the results of\nthe quarrel. The ladies, only a dozen of whom had been in\nattendance upon the regular convention, turned out and\n\ufb01lled the hall of the seceders. All the smiles of all the\nbeauty of Charleston were bestowed upon Mr. Yancey and\nhis followers. They undoubtedly regarded this disruption of\nthe party as insuring the pretext for disunion for which\nthey so ardently wished.\nThe democratic host, as they retired in broken columns\nfrom Charleston, were jostled on the road by the members\nof another convention, on their way to Baltimore \u2014 the\n\u201cNational Constitutional Union Convention\u201d \u2014 made up\nlargely of old whigs who still dreamed that the party of\ntheir early love was in existence \u2014 that it was not dead, but\nsleeping. They met on the ninth of May \u2014 delegates from\nten free states and eleven slave states. There is this to be\nsaid of this body of men \u2014 that they were in the main really\nanxious to save the Union, and that they had a juster\nappreciation of the dangers of the Union than the\nrepublicans, who were fond of ridiculing their fears. They\npassed a \u201cconservative\u201d resolution, declaring that they had\nno principles except \u201cThe Constitution of the country, the\nUnion of the states, and the enforcement of the laws.\u201d The\nconvention nominated John Bell of Tennessee for president,\nand Edward Everett of Massachusetts for vice-president,\n the former of whom, when secession came, went over to\nthe disunionists, and the latter or whom devoted all his\ngreat in\ufb02uence and powers to the maintenance of the\ngovernment, becoming at last a member of the republican\nparty and the recipient of its honors.\nBefore entering upon an account of the Chicago\nConvention, it will be best to state, in brief, the result of the\ndemocratic split at Charleston. The Richmond Convention\nmet and adjourned to await the doings of the Baltimore\nConvention, the members generally going to Baltimore.\nThere they joined in an independent convention, making all\nthe mischief possible, and nominating for president John C.\nBreckinridge, then vice-president of the United States, and\nsince a Major General in the rebel army. The regular\nconvention nominated Mr. Douglas, though he had begged\nthem to sacri\ufb01ce him rather than the party. The party,\nhowever, was already sacri\ufb01ced; and he had had no small\nhand in the slaughter. The antagonism between the\nsouthern and northern sections of the democracy was\nirreconcilable. It was impossible for the two to agree upon\na platform or a man who would carry either section of the\ncountry. Mr. Lincoln had his joke and his \u201clittle story\u201d over\nthe disruption of the democracy. He once knew, he said, a\nsound churchman of the name of Brown, who was the\nmember of a very sober and pious committee having in\ncharge the erection of a bridge over a dangerous and rapid\nriver. Several architects failed, and at last Brown said he\nhad a friend named Jones who had built several bridges,\nand could undoubtedly build that one. So Mr. Jones was\n called in. \u201cCan you build this bridge?\u201d inquired the\ncommittee. \u201cYes,\u201d replied Jones, \u201cor any other. I could build\na bridge to h \u2014 l if necessary.\u201d The committee were\nshocked, and Brown felt called upon to defend his friend. \u201cI\nknow Jones so well,\u201d said he, \u201cand he is so honest a man,\nand so good an architect, that if he states soberly and\npositively that he can build a bridge to \u2014 to \u2014 the infernal\nregions, why, I believe it; but I feel bound to say that I have\nmy doubts about the abutment on the other side.\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d\nsaid Mr. Lincoln, \u201cwhen politicians told me that the\nnorthern and southern wings of the democracy could be\nharmonized, why, I believed them, of course, but I always\nhad my doubts about the abutment on the other side.\u201d\nThough the result of the Baltimore Convention was\nunknown at Chicago, it was foreseen, and it was believed\nthat victory would come to the republican party with any\nrespectable nominee. When the friends of Douglas left\nBaltimore, they left it with none but bitter feelings for those\nwho had destroyed their party, and brought certain defeat\nto the man to whom they were strongly devoted. They felt\nthat Mr. Douglas had deserved better treatment at the\nhands of the South than he had received, and saw, in the\ndisruption of their party, the defeat of all their hopes.\nThe Republican Convention at Chicago assembled on the\nsixteenth of June. There was an immense crowd in\nattendance, casting into the shade entirely the assemblages\nat Charleston and Baltimore. Every hotel was crammed\nfrom basement to attic, even in that city of multitudinous\nand capacious hotels. It was calculated that \ufb01fteen hundred\n persons slept in the Tremont House alone. A huge building\nwas erected for the sessions of the convention, which was\ncalled \u201cThe Wigwam;\u201d and even this could not contain more\nthan a fraction of the twenty-\ufb01ve thousand strangers who\nhad assembled in the city, as delegates and interested\nobservers.\nEdward Bates, Judge McLean, Benjamin F. Wade, N.P.\nBanks, Abraham Lincoln, Simon Cameron, and William H.\nSeward, all had their partisans among outsiders and\ninsiders; but it became evident very early that the contest\nwas really between Mr. Seward and Mr. Lincoln. The chiefs\nof the party were all present, excepting, perhaps, those\nwho imagined that they might possibly be made the\nrecipients of the convention\u2019s favors.\nHon. George Ashmun of Massachusetts was elected to\npreside over the deliberations of the occasion. Canvassing,\ntalking, prophesying, betting, declaiming, were actively in\nprogress everywhere. On the morning of the seventeenth,\nMr. Seward\u2019s friends made a demonstration in his favor, in\nthe form of a procession, following a band of music and\nwearing badges. As they passed the Tremont House, they\nwere greeted with tremendous cheers, the band playing \u201cO,\nisn\u2019t he a darling?\u201d Antagonisms were developed in every\nquarter. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Indiana declared\nthat if Mr. Seward should be nominated they could do\nnothing; Douglas would beat them ten to one. Illinois,\ndevoted to Mr. Lincoln, joined in the cry, but the New\nYorkers scouted the idea that Mr. Seward could not sweep\nwith victory every northern state. The Lincoln men were\n quite as busy as the friends of Mr. Seward, and less noisy.\nMr. Greeley telegraphed to the New York Tribune, on the\nevening of the seventeenth: \u201cMy conclusion, from all that I\ncan gather, is, that the opposition to Governor Seward\ncannot concentrate on any candidate, and that he will be\nnominated;\u201d and this, it must be remembered, was not in\naccordance with Mr. Greeley\u2019s wishes.\nThe platform upon which the party proposed to conduct\nthe campaign was adopted on the second day. The action\nupon this showed that the party had not quite come to the\nstandard of Mr. Lincoln, moderate as he had been. Hon.\nJoshua R. Giddings, one of the old enemies of slavery and\nthe slave power, wished to introduce into the platform that\npart of the Declaration of Independence which asserts, as\nself-evident truths, \u201cthat all men are endowed by their\nCreator with certain inalienable rights, among which are\nthose of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d and that\ngovernments are instituted among men to secure the\nenjoyment of these rights; but objections were made. The\nold man walked grieved and disgusted out of the wigwam,\namid the protestations of the crowd. Mr. George W. Curtis,\na New York delegate, made an appeal to the convention\nthat was irresistible, and the declaration went in, and all\nfelt the stronger and better for it. The utterances of Mr.\nLincoln have already given us the substance of this\nplatform. It contravened no right of slavery in the states,\nunder the Constitution, denounced the subserviency of Mr.\nBuchanan\u2019s administration to a sectional interest and the\ndogma that the Constitution carried slavery into the\n territories and protected it there, declared that the normal\ncondition of all the territory of the United States is that of\nfreedom, and that a sound policy requires a protective\ntari\ufb00, \nc., \nc. It was the platform of the old whig party,\nrepeated in most particulars, except that, in the matter of\nslavery, it introduced, not widely modi\ufb01ed, the old platform\nof the \u201cfree soilers.\u201d The platform was adopted amid\ndemonstrations of the wildest enthusiasm. An eye witness\nof the scene says: \u201call the thousands of men in that\nenormous wigwam commenced swinging their hats, amd\ncheering with intense enthusiasm; and the other thousands\nof ladies waved their handkerchiefs and clapped their\nhands. The roar that went up from that mass of ten\nthousand human beings is indescribable. Such a spectacle\nas was presented for some minutes has never before been\nwitnessed at a convention. A herd of bu\ufb00aloes or lions\ncould not have made a more tremendous roaring.\u201d\nThe Seward men still carried a con\ufb01dent air on the third\nday. They had reason to do so. Their candidate was in many\nrespects the greatest man in the party. He was a statesman\nof acknowledged eminence, and had been for many years\nthe leading representative of the principles upon which the\nrepublican party stood. They were strong, too, in the\nconvention; and they were sure to secure upon the \ufb01rst\nballot more votes for their candidate than could be\nsummoned to the support of any other man.\nOn the assembling of the convention, everybody was\nanxious to get at the decisive work, and, as a preliminary,\nthe various candidates in the \ufb01eld were formally nominated\n by their friends. Mr. Evarts of New York nominated Mr.\nSeward, and Mr. Judd of Illinois named Abraham Lincoln.\nAfterwards, Mr. Dayton of New Jersey, Mr. Cameron of\nPennsylvania, Mr. Chase of Ohio, Edward Bates of Missouri,\nand John McLean of Ohio, were formally nominated; but no\nenthusiasm was awakened by the mention of any names\nexcept those of Mr. Seward and Mr. Lincoln. Caleb B. Smith\nof Indiana seconded the nomination of Mr. Lincoln, as did\nalso Mr. Delano of Ohio, while Carl Schurz of Wisconsin and\nMr. Blair of Michigan seconded the nomination of Mr.\nSeward. It was certain that one of these two men would be\nnominated. On every pronunciation of their names, their\nrespective partisans raised their shouts, vieing with each\nother in the strength of their applause. The excitement of\nthis mass of men at that time cannot be measured by those\nnot there, or by men in their sober senses.\nThe ballot came. Maine gave nearly half her vote for\nLincoln; New Hampshire, seven of her ten for Lincoln.\nMassachusetts was divided. New York voted solid for Mr.\nSeward, giving him her seventy votes. Virginia, which was\nexpected also to vote solid for Mr. Seward, gave fourteen of\nher twenty-two votes for Lincoln. Indiana gave her twenty-\nsix votes for Lincoln without a break. Thus the balloting\nwent on, amid the most intense excitement, until the whole\nnumber of four hundred and sixty-\ufb01ve votes was cast. It\nwas necessary to a choice that one candidate should have\ntwo hundred and thirty-three. William H. Seward had one\nhundred and seventy-three and a half, Abraham Lincoln one\nhundred and two, Edward Bates forty-eight, Simon\n Cameron \ufb01fty and a half, Salmon P. Chase forty-nine. The\nremaining forty-two votes were divided among John\nMcLean, Benjamin F. Wade, William L. Dayton, John M.\nReed, Jacob Collamer, Charles Sumner and John C.\nFremont, \u2014 Reed, Sumner and Fremont having one each.\nOn the second ballot, the \ufb01rst gain for Lincoln was from\nNew Hampshire. Then Vermont followed with her vote,\nwhich she had previously given to her senator, Mr.\nCollamer, as compliment. Pennsylvania came next to his\nsupport, with the votes she had given to Cameron. On the\nwhole ballot, he gained seventy-nine votes, and received\none hundred and eighty-one; while Mr. Seward received\none hundred and eighty-four and a half votes, having\ngained eleven. The announcement of the votes given to Mr.\nSeward and Mr. Lincoln was received by deafening\napplause by their respective partisans. Then came the third\nballot. All felt that it was likely to be the decisive one, and\nthe friends of Mr. Seward trembled for the result.\nHundreds of pencils were in operation, and before the\nresult was announced it was whispered through the\nimmense and excited mass of people that Abraham Lincoln\nhad received two hundred and thirty-one and a half votes,\nonly lacking one vote and a half of an election. Mr. Cartter\nof Ohio was up in an instant, to announce the change of\nfour votes of Ohio from Mr. Chase to Mr. Lincoln. That\n\ufb01nished the work. The excitement had culminated. After a\nmoment\u2019s pause, like the sudden and breathless stillness\nthat \nprecedes \nthe \nhurricane, \nthe \nstorm \nof \nwild,\nuncontrollable and almost insane enthusiasm descended.\n The scene surpassed description. During all the ballotings,\na man had been standing upon the roof, communicating the\nresults to the outsiders, who, in surging masses, far\noutnumbered those who were packed into the wigwam. To\nthis man one of the secretaries shouted: \u201cFire the salute!\nAbe Lincoln is nominated!\u201d Then, as the cheering inside\ndied away, the roar began on the outside, and swelled up\nfrom the excited masses like the noise of many waters. This\nthe insiders heard, and to it they replied. Thus deep called\nto deep with such a frenzy of sympathetic enthusiasm that\neven the thundering salute of cannon was unheard by many\nupon the platform.\nWhen the multitudes became too tired to cheer more, the\nbusiness of the convention proceeded. Half a dozen men\nwere on their feet announcing the change of votes of their\nstates, swelling Mr. Lincoln\u2019s majority. Missouri, Iowa,\nKentucky, Minnesota, Virginia, California, Texas, District of\nColumbia, Kansas, Nebraska and Oregon insisted on\ncasting unanimous votes for Mr. Lincoln, before the vote\nwas declared. While these changes were going on, a\nphotograph of the nominee was brought in and exhibited to\nthe convention. When the vote was declared, Mr. Evarts, on\nbehalf of the New York delegation, expressed his grief that\nMr. Seward had not been nominated, and then moved that\nthe nomination of Mr. Lincoln should be made unanimous.\nJohn A. Andrew of Massachusetts and Carl Schurz of\nWisconsin seconded the motion, and it was carried. Before\nthe \nnomination \nof \na \nvice-president, \nthe \nconvention\nadjourned for dinner. It is reported that such had been the\n excitement during the morning session that men who never\ntasted intoxicating liquors staggered like drunken men, on\ncoming into the open air. The nervous tension had been so\ngreat that, when it subsided, they were as \ufb02accid and\nfeeble as if they had but recently risen from a fever.\nThe excitement in the city only began as it subsided in\nthe convention. Mr. Lincoln was the favorite of Chicago and\nof Illinois \u2014 he was the people\u2019s idol. Men shouted and\nsang, and did all sorts of foolish things in the incontinence\nof their joy. After dinner the convention met again, and for\nthe last time. The simple business was the completion of\nthe ticket by the nomination of a candidate for vice-\npresident; and the result was the selection of Hannibal\nHamlin of Maine.\nThe defeat of Mr. Seward was a sad blow to his friends.\nThey had presented to the convention one of the prominent\nstatesmen of the nation; and he had undoubtedly been\nslaughtered to satisfy the clamor for \u201cavailability.\u201d The\ncountry at large did not know Mr. Lincoln in any capacity\nexcept that of a political debater; and many sections had no\nfamiliarity with his reputation, even in this character. Mr.\nSeward, on the contrary, had been in public life for thirty\nyears; and his name and fame were as common and as well\nestablished in the regard of the nation, as the name and\nfame of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster had been. He was a\nman of great accomplishments, of wide experience, of large\nin\ufb02uence and surpassing ability \u2014 recognized as such\nabroad as well as at home. Their disappointment is not to\nbe wondered at, or blamed. Mr. Lincoln had not been\n proved. His capacity for public a\ufb00airs had yet to be\ndemonstrated; and he had been nominated over the head of\nMr. Seward partly for this reason \u2014 the reason that he was\na new man, and had no public record. If events have proved\nthat the choice between these two men was a fortunate\none, they can hardly have proved that it was a wise one \u2014\nthat it was the result of an intelligent and honest choice\nbetween the two men. It is pleasant to remember that Mr.\nLincoln, when elected to the presidency, called to the \ufb01rst\nplace in his cabinet the man whom the convention had set\naside, and that the country had the advantage of his wise\ncounsels throughout the darkest period and most di\ufb00icult\npassage of its history.\nAs has been stated, the city of Chicago was wild with\ndelight. One hundred guns were \ufb01red from the top of the\nTremont House. Decorated and illuminated rails were\naround the newspaper o\ufb00ices. All the bars and drinking\nhalls were crowded with men who were either worn out\nwith excitement or mad with delight. From Chicago the\nnews spread over the country, and the cannon\u2019s throat\nresponded to the click of the telegraph from Maine to the\nMississippi. The outgoing trains that night found bon\ufb01res\nblazing at every village, and excited crowds assembled to\ncheer the retiring delegates, most of whom were either too\nweak or too hoarse to respond.\nIn the little city of Spring\ufb01eld, in the heart of Illinois, two\nhundred miles from where those exciting events were in\nprogress, sat Abraham Lincoln, in close and constant\ntelegraphic communication with his friends in Chicago. He\n was apprised of the results of every ballot, and, with his\nhome friends, sat in the Journal o\ufb00ice receiving and\ncommenting upon the dispatches. It was one of the decisive\nmoments of his life \u2014 a moment on which hung his fate as a\npublic man \u2014 his place in history. He fully appreciated the\nmomentous results of the convention to himself and the\nnation, and foresaw the nature of the great struggle which\nhis nomination and election would inaugurate. A moment,\nand he knew that he would either become the central man\nof a nation, or a cast-o\ufb00 politician whose ambition for the\nnation\u2019s highest honors would be forever blasted. At last, in\nthe midst of intense and painful excitement, a messenger\nfrom the telegraph o\ufb00ice entered with the decisive dispatch\nin his hand. Without handing it to any one, he took his way\nsolemnly to the side of Mr. Lincoln, and said: \u201cthe\nconvention has made a nomination, and Mr. Seward is \u2014\nthe second man on the list.\u201d Then he jumped upon the\neditorial table and shouted, \u201cgentlemen, I propose three\ncheers for Abraham Lincoln, the next President of the\nUnited States;\u201d and the call was boisterously responded to.\nHe then handed the dispatch to Mr. Lincoln who read in\nsilence, and then aloud, its contents. After the excitement\nhad in a measure passed away from the little assembly, Mr.\nLincoln rose, and remarking that there was \u201ca little\nwoman\u201d on Eighth street who had some interest in the\nmatter, pocketed the telegram and walked home.\nAs soon as the news reached Spring\ufb01eld, the citizens\nwho had a personal a\ufb00ection for Mr. Lincoln which\namounted almost to idolatry, responded with a hundred\n guns, and during the afternoon thronged his house to\ntender their congratulations and express their joy. In the\nevening, the State House was thrown open, and a most\nenthusiastic meeting held by the republicans. At its close,\nthey marched in a body to the Lincoln mansion, and called\nfor the nominee. Mr. Lincoln appeared, and after a brief,\nmodest and hearty speech, invited as many as could get\ninto the house to enter, the crowd responding that after the\nfourth of March they would give him a larger house. The\npeople did not retire until a late hour, and then moved o\ufb00\nreluctantly, leaving the excited household to their rest.\nOn the following day, which was Saturday, Mr. Ashmun,\nthe president of the convention, at the head of a committee,\nvisited Spring\ufb01eld to apprise Mr. Lincoln o\ufb00icially of his\nnomination. In order that the ceremony might be smoothly\nperformed, the committee had an interview with Mr.\nLincoln before the hour appointed for the formal call. They\nfound him at a loss to know how to treat a present he had\njust received at the hands of some of his considerate\nSpring\ufb01eld friends. Knowing Mr. Lincoln\u2019s temperate or\nrather abstinent habits, and laboring under the impression\nthat the visitors from Chicago would have wants beyond\nthe power of cold water to satisfy, these friends had sent in\nsundry hampers of wines and liquors. These strange \ufb02uids\ntroubled Mr. Lincoln; and he frankly confessed as much to\nthe members of the committee. The chairman at once\nadvised him to return the gift, and to o\ufb00er no stimulants to\nhis guests, as many would be present besides the\ncommittee. Thus relieved, he made ready for the reception\n of the company, according to his own ideas of hospitality.\nThe evening came, and with it Mr. Ashmun and the\ncommittee and many others. Mr. Ashmun on being\npresented said:\n\u201cI have, sir, the honor, on behalf of the gentlemen who\nare present \u2014 a committee appointed by the republican\nconvention recently assembled at Chicago \u2014 to discharge a\nmost pleasant duty. We have come, sir, under a vote of\ninstructions to that committee, to notify you that you have\nbeen selected by the convention of the republicans at\nChicago for President of the United States. They instruct\nus, sir, to notify you of that selection; and that committee\ndeem it not only respectful to yourself, but appropriate to\nthe important matter which they have in hand, that they\nshould come in person, and present to you the authentic\nevidence of the action of that convention; and, sir, without\nany phrase which shall either be personally plauditory to\nyourself, or which shall have any reference to the principles\ninvolved in the questions which are connected with your\nnomination, I desire to present to you the letter which has\nbeen prepared, and which informs you of your nomination,\nand with it the platform, resolutions and sentiments which\nthe convention adopted. Sir, at your convenience, we shall\nbe glad to receive from you such a response as it may be\nyour pleasure to give us.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln listened to the address with sad gravity.\nThere was in his heart no exultation \u2014 no elation-only the\npressure of a new and great responsibility. He paused\nthoughtfully for a moment, and then replied:\n \u201cMr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee: I\ntender to you, and through you to the republican national\nconvention, and all the people represented in it, my\nprofoundest thanks for the high honor done me, which you\nnow formally announce. Deeply and even painfully sensible\nof the great responsibility which is inseparable from this\nhigh honor \u2014 a responsibility which I could almost wish\nhad fallen upon some one of the far more eminent and\nexperienced statesmen Whose distinguished names were\nbefore the convention \u2014 I shall, by your leave, consider\nmore fully the resolutions of the convention denominated\nthe \nplatform, \nand, \nwithout \nany \nunnecessary \nor\nunreasonable delay, respond to you, Mr. Chairman, in\nwriting, not doubting that the platform will be found\nsatisfactory, and the nomination gratefully accepted. And\nnow I will no longer defer the pleasure of taking you, and\neach of you, by the hand.\u201d\nJudge Kelly of Pennsylvania, one of the committee, and a\nvery tall man, looked at Mr. Lincoln, up and down, before it\ncame his turn to take his hand, a scrutiny that had not\nescaped Mr. Lincoln\u2019s quick eye. So, when he took the hand\nof the Judge, he inquired: \u201cwhat is your hight?\u201d \u201csix feet\nthree,\u201d replied the Judge. \u201cWhat is yours, Mr. Lincoln?\u201d\n\u201cSix feet four,\u201d responded Mr. Lincoln. \u201cThen, sir,\u201d said the\nJudge, \u201cPennsylvania bows to Illinois. My dear man,\u201d he\ncontinued, \u201cfor years my heart has been aching for a\npresident that I could look up to; and I\u2019ve found him at last,\nin the land where we thought there were none but little\ngiants.\u201d\n The evening passed quickly away, and the committee\nretired with a very pleasant impression of the man in whose\nhands they had placed the standard of the party for a great\nand decisive campaign. Mr. Ashmun met the nominee as an\nold friend, with whom he had acted in Congress, when both\nwere members of the old whig party; and the interview\nbetween them was one of peculiar interest. It is a strange\ncoincidence that the man who received Mr. Lincoln\u2019s \ufb01rst\nspoken and written utterance as the standard bearer of the\nrepublican party, received the last word he ever wrote as\nPresident of the United States.\nOn the twenty-third of June, which occurred on the\nfollowing week, Mr. Lincoln responded to the letter which\nMr. Ashmun presented him as follows:\n\u201cSir: I accept the nomination tendered me by the\nconvention over which you presided, of which I am formally\napprised in a letter of yourself and others, acting as a\ncommittee of the convention for that purpose. The\ndeclaration \nof \nprinciples \nand \nsentiments \nwhich\naccompanies your letter meets my approval, and it shall be\nmy care not to violate it, or disregard it in any part.\nImploring the assistance of Divine Providence, and with\ndue regard to the views and feelings of all who were\nrepresented in the convention, to the rights of all the states\nand territories and people of the nation, to the inviolability\nof the Constitution and the perpetual union, harmony and\nprosperity of all, I am most happy to co-operate for the\npractical success of the principles declared by the\nconvention. Your obliged friend and fellow-citizen,\n \u201cAbraham Lincoln.\n\u201cHon. George Ashmun.\u201d\nThus was Abraham Lincoln placed before the nation as a\ncandidate for the highest honor in its power to bestow. It\nhad been a long and tedious passage to this point in his\nhistory. He was in the \ufb01fty-second year of his age. He had\nspent half of his years in what was literay a wilderness.\nBorn in the humblest and remotest obscurity, subjected to\nthe rudest toil in the meanest o\ufb00ices, gathering his\nacquisitions from the scantiest sources, achieving the\ndevelopment of his powers by means of his own institution,\nhe had, with none of the tricks of the demagogue, with\nnone of the aids of wealth and social in\ufb02uence, with none of\nthe opportunities for exhibiting his powers which high\no\ufb00icial position bestows, against all the combinations of\ngenius and eminence and interest, raised himself by force\nof manly excellence of heart and brain into national\nrecognition, and had become the focal center of the\na\ufb00ectionate interest and curious inquisition of thirty\nmillions of people at home, and of multitudes throughout\nthe civilized world.\n   ha ter   II.\nTO APPRECIATE THE enormity of the rebellion of which Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s election was made the pretext, by the southern\nleaders, it is never to be forgotten that the whole South, by\nbecoming a party in the election, committed itself to the\nresult. They were in all honor bound to abide by that result,\nwhatever it might be. If the foes of Mr. Lincoln had refused\nto vote at all, they would have gone into the rebellion with\na much cleaner record; but the \ufb01rst item of that record was\na breach of personal honor on the part of every man who\nengaged in insurrection. Every member of both houses of\nCongress, every member of the cabinet, and every federal\no\ufb00ice-holder who turned against the government, was\nobliged, beyond this breach of personal honor to become a\nperjurer \u2014 to trample upon the solemn oath by virtue of\nwhich he held his o\ufb00ice.\nAllusion has already been made to the operations of the\nplotters in Mr. Buchanan\u2019s cabinet. Before the election,\nFloyd had, as has already been stated, sent one hundred\nand \ufb01fteen thousand muskets from northern armories to\nsouthern arsenals. General Scott had warned him of the\ndanger to which the federal forts at the South were liable,\nand had advised that, as a precautionary measure, they\nshould be garrisoned. To this warning the secret traitor\npaid no attention. Attorney General Black had given his\n o\ufb00icial opinion that Congress had no right to carry on a war\nagainst any state. The President himself was only a weak\ninstrument in the hands of the intriguers. He consented to\nhave his hands tied; and if he made any protests they were\nweak and childish. More than anything else he longed to\nhave them delay the execution of their schemes until he\nshould be released from o\ufb00ice.\nSouth Carolina, the breeding bed of secession and the\nbirthplace of the fatal State Rights Heresy, took the lead in\nthe secession movement, and called a state convention to\nmeet at Columbia on the seventeenth of December. On the\ntenth of November, four days after the election, a bill was\nintroduced in the legislature of the state calling out ten\nthousand \nvolunteers. \nThe \ntwo \nsenators \nfrom \nSouth\nCarolina, Chesnut and Hammond, resigned their seats, one\non the tenth and the other on the eleventh of the same\nmonth. Robert Toombs, a Georgia senator, made a violent\nsecession speech at Milledgeville in his own state, and this,\nnotwithstanding the fact that he continued to hold his seat.\nHowell Cobb, the Secretary of the Treasury, resigned on\nthe tenth of December, declaring his inability to relieve the\ntreasury from the embarrassments into which he had\npurposely led it; and two days before the secession\nconvention met in South Carolina the Secretary of War,\nFloyd, accepted the requisition of that state for her quota of\nUnited States arms for . Meetings were held all over\nthe \nSouth \nwhere \ntreason \nwas \nboldly \nplotted \nand\npromulgated, and the people were goaded to the adoption\nof the desperate expedients determined upon by the\n leaders. The South Carolina Secession Convention met at\nColumbia on the seventeenth of December, but, on account\nof the prevalence of the small pox there, adjourned to\nCharleston, where, on the twentieth, they formally issued\nan ordinance of separation, and declared \u201cthat the Union\nnow (then) subsisting between South Carolina and other\nstates under the name of the United States of America is\nhereby (was thereby) dissolved.\u201d\nThe passage of this ordinance \ufb01lled the Charlestonians\nwith delight, and, in the evening, in the presence of an\nimmense crowd, the fatal instrument was signed and\nsealed; and Governor Pickens immediately issued a\nproclamation, declaring South Carolina to be \u201ca separate,\nfree, sovereign and independent state.\u201d This was followed\nby the withdrawal of Messrs. McQueen, Boyd, Bonham and\nAshmore from Congress, although their resignation was not\nrecognized by the speaker, on the ground that such an act\nwould be a recognition of the legitimacy of the action of the\nstate.\nBefore \nthe \nadjournment \nof \nthe \nSouth \nCarolina\nConvention, \nresolutions \nwere \npassed \ncalling \nfor \na\nconvention \nof \nthe \nseceding \nstates \nto \nbe \nheld \nat\nMontgomery, Alabama, for the purpose of forming a\nsouthern confederacy, and providing or suggesting a plan\nof \noperations \nand \norganization. \nThe \nCongressional\nconspirators were active in Washington, and in constant\ncommunication with their respective states, urging on the\nwork of national disintegration. On the eighth of January a\ncaucus of southern senators at Washington counseled\n immediate secession; and at the national capital there was\nno in\ufb02uence that could, or would, withstand this reckless\nand rampant treason. As quickly as it could be done\nconsistently with the safety of the cause of treason,\nMississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and\nTexas, followed the lead of South Carolina in to secession.\nForts and arsenals were seized in all the seceded states,\nthe steamer Star of the West, sent to Charleston with\nreinforcements and supplies for Major Anderson, was\ndriven out of the harbor, a southern confederacy was\nformed, with Je\ufb00erson Davis as president, and thus, by\nevery necessary preliminary act, was the most terrible\nrebellion inaugurated that has ever reddened the pages of\nhistory. In cabinet meeting, the southern secretaries, still\noccupying places, were boldly demanding that the forts at\nCharleston should be evacuated; and Mr. Buchanan was too\nweak to take a position against them. But he had one man\nin his cabinet who was not afraid to speak the truth. Edwin\nM. Stanton who had been called to \ufb01ll the o\ufb00ice of attorney\ngeneral on the retirement of Mr. Black, rose and said: \u201cMr.\nPresident, it is my duty, as your legal adviser, to say that\nyou have no right to give up the property of the\ngovernment, or abandon the soldiers of the United States\nto its enemies; and the course proposed by the Secretary of\nthe Interior, if followed, is treason, and will involve you and\nall concerned in treason.\u201d For the \ufb01rst time in the cabinet\ntreason had been called by its true name, and the men who\nwere leading the President and the country to ruin were\ntold to their faces the nature of their foul business. Floyd\n and Thompson, who had had everything their own way,\nsprang \ufb01ercely to their feet, while Mr. Holt, the Postmaster\nGeneral, took his position by the side of Mr. Stanton; and\nMr. Buchanan besought them with a senile whine to take\ntheir seats. Thus bolstered by Mr. Stanton the President\ndetermined not to withdraw Major Anderson. This act of\nMr. Stanton was the \ufb01rst in Mr. Buchanan\u2019s administration\nthat seemed to be based on a full comprehension of the\nnature of the situation. and it was a noble introduction to\nthe great work he was destined to accomplish in the\nsuppression of the rebellion.\nThese events occurring in rapid succession produced a\nprofound impression at the North. The whole country was\n\ufb01lled with feverish apprehension. A peace congress took up\nits abode in Washington, with the notorious John Tyler for\npresident. Measures of compromise were introduced into\nCongress and urged with great vigor. Those northern states\nthat had passed \u201cpersonal liberty bills,\u201d and other\nmeasures o\ufb00ensive to the South made haste to repeal them,\nthat all possible pretexts for rebellion might be put out of\nthe way. Every practicable attempt was made by the fearful\nand the faithless to compel such concessions to the slave\npower as would calm its ire, and obviate the necessity of\narmed collision. There were not wanting men in the North\nwhose sympathies were with the traitors, and who would\nwillingly and gladly have joined them in the attempt to\nrevolutionize the government, by preventing Mr. Lincoln\nfrom taking his seat, and delivering over Washington and\nthe government to the plotters. Indeed, many of the traitors\n openly declared that by secession they did not mean\nsecession \nat \nall, \nbut \nrevolution. \nCommerce \nand\nmanufactures begged for peace at the slaveholder\u2019s price,\nwhatever it might be.\nWashington itself was full of treason. It was the\nprevailing spirit of all the fashionable life of the national\ncapital. All the governmental departments were crowded\nwith it. It was the talk of the hotels. Loyalty was snubbed\nand dishonored. Maryland, though she had passed no\nordinance of secession, was disloyal. The sympathies of the\nhigher classes of Baltimore were all with the traitors. Thus\nsecession was an accomplished fact, the forts and arsenals\nof the United States at the South were in the hands of the\ntraitors, the northern arsenals were stripped, every\navailable ship with the exception of two was beyond call,\nthe confederate government was organized, the United\nStates treasury was bankrupt, the whole South was\nseething with the excitement of treason, disloyalty reigned\nin \nevery \ndepartment \nof \nthe \ngovernment, \nsouthern\nsympathizers were scattered over the whole North,\nbusiness was depressed, and a fearful looking-for of\nterrible days and terrible events had taken possession of\nthose who still loved the Union, when Mr. Lincoln started\non his journey to Washington, to assume the o\ufb00ice to which\nhe had been elected.\nSilently, and with sad forebodings, had he waited in\nSpring\ufb01eld the opening of the storm. With an intense\ninterest he had followed the development of the disunion\nscheme, and knowing the character of the southern leaders\n he appreciated the desperate nature of the struggle upon\nwhich he was entering.\nOn the th of February, , Mr. Lincoln reluctantly\nbade adieu to the peaceful scenes of home and the grateful\npresence of his best personal friends, for the untried \ufb01eld\nof high o\ufb00icial life. That he dreaded the change, and\ncommitted himself to it with the gravest forebodings, there\nis no question. Already had the threats of assassination\nreached his ears. It had been widely hinted by his enemies\nthat his inauguration would never be permitted; and even if\nit should be, he knew that the most oppressive duties\nawaited him.\nOn his departure for the railroad station, he was\naccompanied by a large concourse of his neighbors and\nfriends, the most of whom insisted on a parting shake of\nthe hand. After passing through this trial, he appealed upon\nthe platform of the car set apart for himself and his family\nand friends, and with the deepest feeling delivered to them\nhis parting words.\n\u201cMy friends,\u201d said he, \u201cno one not in my position can\nappreciate the sadness I feel at this parting. To this people\nI owe all that I am. Here I have lived more than a quarter of\na century. Here my children were born, and here one of\nthem lies buried. I know not how soon I shall see you again.\nA duty devolves upon me which is greater, perhaps, than\nthat which has devolved upon any other man since the days\nof Washington. He never would have succeeded except for\nthe aid of Divine Providence, upon which he at all times\nrelied. I feel that I cannot succeed without the same divine\n aid which sustained him, and on the same Almighty Being I\nplace my reliance for support; and I hope you, my friends,\nwill pray that I may receive that divine assistance without\nwhich I cannot succeed, but with which success is certain.\nAgain, I bid you all an a\ufb00ectionate farewell.\u201d\nThis parting address was telegraphed to every part of the\ncountry, and was strangely misinterpreted. So little was the\nman\u2019s character understood that his simple and earnest\nrequest that his neighbors should pray for him was\nreceived by many as an evidence both of his weakness and\nhis hypocrisy. No President had ever before asked the\npeople, in a public address, to pray for him. It sounded like\nthe cant of the conventicle to ears unaccustomed to the\nlanguage of piety from the lips of politicians. The request\nwas tossed about as a joke\u2014 \u201cold Abe\u2019s last\u201d \u2014 but it came\nfrom a heart surcharged with a sense of need, and strong in\nits belief that the Almighty listens to the prayers of men.\nMr. Lincoln had before him, on this journey, one of the\nmost di\ufb00icult tasks of his life. The country was very anxious\nto get some hint as to his policy. This hint he did not intend\nto give, until he should be obliged to give it o\ufb00icially. His\ntask, then, of talking without saying anything, was not only\na new one, but it was one for which he had no talent. He\nhad never acquired, and could never acquire, the faculty of\nuttering graceful and acceptable nothings. Give him\nsomething to talk about, and he could talk. Give him a\nknotty point to argue, and he could argue; but to talk for\nthe mere purpose of talk was beyond his power. To talk\nwhen it was his impulse and his policy to say nothing, was\n the hardest task of his life. Hence, there had never been a\npassage in his life in which he appeared to such a\ndisadvantage as he did in the speeches made during this\njourney. He could win the profoundest admiration of the\ngifted and the learned at the Cooper Institute, but on the\nplatform of a railroad car, or before an august committee of\ncity magnates, he was as much at a loss as a school-boy\nwould have been.\nMrs. Lincoln and her three boys were in the car as it\nrolled out of Spring\ufb01eld; and with them a number of Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s old friends, Governor Yates, Ex-Governor Moore,\nDr. W.M. Wallace, Hon. N.P. Judd, Hon. O.H. Browning,\nJudge David Davis and Colonel E.E. Ellsworth were of the\nnumber, as were also John M. Hay and J.G. Nicolay,\nafterwards Mr. Lincoln\u2019s private secretaries. The \ufb01rst point\nof destination was Indianapolis, but Mr. Lincoln was called\nout at various places on the route, to respond to the\ngreetings of the crowds that had assembled at the way\nstations.\nOn arriving at Indianapolis, the party found the city\nentirely devoted for the time to the pleasant task of giving\ntheir elected chief magistrate a \ufb01tting reception. Business\nwas suspended, \ufb02ags were \ufb02oating everywhere, and when,\nat \ufb01ve o\u2019clock, the train rolled into the Union depot, a\nsalute of thirty-four guns announced them and gave them\ngreeting. Governor Morton addressed to Mr. Lincoln an\nearnest and hearty speech of welcome, and then the\npresidential party were escorted through the principal\nstreets by a procession composed of both houses of the\n legislature, the municipal authorities, and the military and\n\ufb01remen. Arriving at the Bates House, Mr. Lincoln was\ncalled for, when he appeared, and made the following brief\naddress:\n\u201cFellow citizens of the State of Indiana: I am here to\nthank you much for this magni\ufb01cent welcome, and still\nmore for the very generous support given by your state to\nthat political cause, which I think is the true and just cause\nof the whole country and the whole world. Solomon says\n\u2018there is a time to keep silence;\u2019 and when men wrangle by\nthe mouth, with no certainty that they mean the same thing\nwhile using the same words, it perhaps were as well if they\nwould keep silence. The words \u2018coercion\u2019 and \u2018invasion\u2019 are\nmuch used in these days, and often with some temper and\nhot blood. Let us make sure, if we can, that we do not\nmisunderstand the meaning of those who use them. Let us\nget the exact de\ufb01nitions of these words, not from\ndictionaries, but from the men themselves, who certainly\ndeprecate the things they would represent by the use of the\nwords. What, then, is \u2018coercion?\u2019 What is \u2018invasion?\u2019 Would\nthe marching of an army into South Carolina, without the\nconsent of her people, and with hostile intent towards\nthem, be invasion? I certainly think it would, and it would\nbe \u2018coercion\u2019 also if the South Carolinians were forced to\nsubmit. But if the United States should merely hold and\nretake its own forts and other property, and collect the\nduties on foreign importations, or even withhold the mails\nfrom places where they were habitually violated, would any\nor all of these things be \u2018invasion\u2019 or \u2018coercion?\u2019 Do our\n professed lovers of the Union, who spitefully resolve that\nthey will resist coercion and invasion, understand that such\nthings as these, on the part of the United States, would be\ncoercion or invasion of a state? If so, their idea of means to\npreserve the object of their great a\ufb00ection would seem to\nbe exceedingly thin and airy. If sick, the little pills of the\nhomoeopathist would be much too large for it to swallow. In\ntheir view, the Union, as a family relation, would seem to be\nno regular marriage, but rather a sort of \u2018free-love\u2019\narrangement, to be maintained on passional attraction. By\nthe way, in what consists the special sacredness of a state?\nI speak not of the position assigned to a state in the Union\nby the Constitution, for that is the bond we all recognize.\nThat position, however, a state cannot carry out of the\nUnion with it. I speak of that assumed primary right of a\nstate to rule all which is less than itself, and to ruin all\nwhich is larger than itself. If a state and a county, in a given\ncase, should be equal in extent of territory and equal in\nnumber of inhabitants, in what, as a matter of principle, is\nthe state better than the county? Would an exchange of\nname be an exchange of rights? Upon what principle, upon\nwhat rightful principle, may a state, being no more than\none-\ufb01ftieth part of the nation in soil and population, break\nup the nation, and then coerce a proportionably larger\nsubdivision of itself in the most arbitrary way? What\nmysterious right to play tyrant is conferred on a district or\ncountry with its people, by merely calling it a state? Fellow-\ncitizens, I am not asserting any thing. I am merely asking\n questions for you to consider. And now allow me to bid you\nfarewell.\u201d\nThe unwillingness of Mr. Lincoln to speak on public\nquestions at this time is evident enough from these\nremarks; but he could not resist the inclination to expose\nsome of his ideas, touching certain words which were then\nin circulation, and they undoubtedly conveyed hints\nconcerning his policy.\nOn the following day, Mr. Lincoln and his party started by\na \nspecial \ntrain \nfor \nCincinnati. \nAn \nimmense \ncrowd\nassembled, and cheered them as they moved o\ufb00. The train\nwas composed of four passenger cars, the third and fourth\nof which were occupied by the Cincinnati committee of\nreception, who greeted Mr. Lincoln at once \u2014 Judge Este\non behalf of the citizens, and Major Dennis J. Yoohey on\nbehalf of the Board of Common Council. Mr. Lincoln\nresponded brie\ufb02y. The \ufb01rst stop was at Shelbyville, where\nMr. Lincoln was obliged to show himself to the enthusiastic\nassemblage, though, from the brevity of the stop, he could\nsay nothing. At Greensburgh and Lawrenceburgh Mr.\nLincoln made brief remarks to the crowds that had\nassembled. The wisest and most characteristic thing that\nhe uttered at the latter place was in these words: \u201cLet me\ntell you that if the people remain right, your public men can\nnever betray you. If, in my brief term of o\ufb00ice, I shall be\nwicked or foolish, if you remain right and true and honest\nyou cannot be betrayed. My power is temporary and\n\ufb02eeting \u2014 yours as eternal as the principles of liberty.\n Cultivate and protect that sentiment, and your ambitious\nleaders will be reduced to the position of servants.\u201d\nThe train passed by the burial place of General Harrison\nwho had occupied brie\ufb02y the presidential chair, and here\nthe family of the deceased patriot were assembled. Mr.\nLincoln bowed his respects to the group and to the memory\nof his predecessor.\nThe twelfth day of February was remarkably sunny and\ncheerful, and a large concourse of citizens had assembled\nto give Mr. Lincoln greeting and to catch a glimpse of his\nface. All the streets leading to the railroad depot were\nthronged with people; and the windows and roofs and every\nperch from which a lookout could be obtained were\noccupied. It took a large force of military and police to keep\nthe way clear. A distant cannon announced the approach of\nthe train, and then there went up from the multitude such a\ncheer as such a multitude alone can give. After some\ndi\ufb00iculty the party reached their carriages, and then the\ncrowd went wild with enthusiasm, cheering the President\nand the Union, Mr. Lincoln rising in the carriage with\nuncovered head, and acknowledging the greetings that met\nhim at every crossing. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s carriage was drawn by\nsix white horses, and was surrounded by a detachment of\npolice to keep o\ufb00 the crowd. Mayor Bishop occupied a seat\nby his side. All along the route of the procession houses\nwere decorated with the national colors, and various\ndevices for expressing personal and patriotic feeling. The\nCourt House, Custom House, Catholic Institute, city\nbuildings, newspaper o\ufb00ices, hotels, \nc., were all gaily\n decorated. Banners, transparencies and patriotic emblems\nand mottoes were everywhere. At the Orphan Asylum, all\nthe children came out and sang \u201cHail Columbia.\u201d Some\nincidents occurred that created special and peculiar\ninterest, and some that excited no little amusement. A\nbrawny German took a little girl in his arms, and carried\nher to the carriage, when she modestly presented to the\nPresident \na \nsingle \n\ufb02ower, \nwhich \ncompliment \nhe\nacknowledged by stooping and kissing the child. It was a\nsmall incident \u2014 a very pretty incident \u2014 but incidents like\nthese depend for their e\ufb00ect upon the susceptibilities of the\nobservers; and many of the excited multitude were touched\nto tears. One German devised a characteristic compliment.\nHe took a seat upon a huge beer barrel, and, with a glass of\nits contents in his hand, addressed the President thus: \u201cGod\nbe with you! Enforce the laws and save our country! Here\u2019s\nyour health!\u201d From the depot to the Burnet House, he rode\nthrough a dense mass of men, women and children, who\ntook every mode of expressing their enthusiastic good will.\nIt would have been impossible for Cincinnati to do more to\nreceive an emperor or reward a conqueror.\nThe Burnet House was reached at \ufb01ve o\u2019clock, and soon\nafterwards Mr. Lincoln appeared upon the balcony. Mayor\nBishop introduced him to the people and gave him a formal\nwelcome \u201cin the name of the people of all classes.\u201d Mr.\nLincoln then replied:\n\u201cMr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen: Twenty-four hours\nago, at the Capital of Indiana, I said to myself, \u2018I have never\nseen so many people assembled together in winter\n weather.\u2019 I am no longer able to say that. But it is what\nmight reasonably have been expected \u2014 that this great city\nof Cincinnati would thus acquit herself on such an occasion.\nMy friends, I am entirely overwhelmed by the magni\ufb01cence\nof the reception which has been given, I will not say to me,\nbut to the President elect of the United States of America.\nMost heartily do I thank you one and all for it. I am\nreminded by the address of your worthy Mayor, that this\nreception is given not by one political party; and even if I\nhad not been so reminded by His Honor, I could not have\nfailed to know the fact by the extent of the multitude I see\nbefore me now. I could not look upon this vast assemblage\nwithout being made aware that all parties were united in\nthis reception. This is as it should be. It is as it should have\nbeen if Senator Douglas had been elected; it is as it should\nhave been if Mr. Bell had been elected, as it should have\nbeen it Mr. Breckinridge had been elected; as it should ever\nbe when any citizen of the United States is constitutionally\nelected President of the United States. Allow me to say that\nI think what has occurred here to-day could not have\noccurred in any other country on the face of the globe,\nwithout the in\ufb02uence of the free institutions which we have\nunceasingly enjoyed for three-quarters of a century. There\nis no country where the people can turn out and enjoy this\nday precisely as they please, save under the benign\nin\ufb02uence of the free institutions of our land. I hope that,\nalthough we have some threatening national di\ufb00iculties\nnow, while these free institutions shall continue to be in the\nenjoyment of millions of free people of the United States,\n we will see repeated every four years what we now witness.\nIn a few short years I and every other individual man who\nis now living will pass away. I hope that our national\ndi\ufb00iculties will also pass away, and I hope we shall see in\nthe streets of Cincinnati \u2014 good old Cincinnati \u2014 for\ncenturies to come, once every four years, the people give\nsuch a reception as this to the constitutionally elected\nPresident of the whole United States. I hope you will all join\nin that reception, and that you shall also welcome your\nbrethren across the river to participate in it. We will\nwelcome them in every state in the Union, no matter where\nthey are from. From away South, we shall extend to them a\ncordial good will, when our present di\ufb00erences shall have\nbeen forgotten and blown to the winds forever.\n\u201cI have spoken but once before this in Cincinnati. That\nwas a year previous to the late presidential election. On\nthat occasion, in a playful manner but with sincere words, I\naddressed much of what I said to the Kentuckians. I gave\nmy opinion that we as republicans would ultimately beat\nthem as democrats, but that they could postpone that result\nlonger by nominating Senator Douglas for the presidency\nthan they could in any other way. They did not in the true\nsense of the word nominate Douglas, and the result has\ncome certainly as soon as I expected. I also told them how I\nexpected they would be treated after they should have been\nbeaten; and I now wish to call or recall their attention to\nwhat I then said upon that subject. I then said: \u2018When we\ndo, as we say, beat you, you perhaps will want to know\nwhat we will do with you. We mean to treat you as near as\n we possibly can as Washington, Je\ufb00erson and Madison\ntreated you. We mean to leave you alone and in no way to\ninterfere with your institutions, to abide by all and every\ncompromise of the Constitution; and, in a word, coming\nback to the original proposition to treat you as far as\ndegenerate men, if we have degenerated, may, according to\nthe examples of those noble fathers Washington, Je\ufb00erson\nand Madison. We mean to remember that you are as good\nas we \u2014 that there is no di\ufb00erence us \u2014 other than the\ndi\ufb00erence of circumstances. We mean to recognize and\nbear in mind always that you have as good hearts in your\nbosoms as other people, or as good as we claim to have,\nand treat you accordingly.\u2019\n\u201cFellow-citizens of Kentucky, Friends, Brethren: May I\ncall you such? In my new position I see no occasion and feel\nno inclination to retract a word of this. If it shall not be\nmade good, be assured that the fault shall not be mine.\u201d\nThis little speech, remarkable for nothing so much as its\nthoroughly friendly feeling toward all classes and men of all\nopinions, was received with warm approval. Subsequently\nhe was called upon by a procession of two thousand\nGermans, who, in their formal address, indicated a desire\nfor some utterance touching his public policy. In his\nresponse, Mr. Lincoln begged to be excused from entering\nupon such an exposition. \u201cI deem it due to myself and the\nwhole \ncountry,\u201d \nsaid \nMr. \nLincoln, \n\u201cin \nthe \npresent\nextraordinary condition of the country and of public\nopinion, that I should wait and see the last development of\npublic opinion before I give my views, or express myself at\n the time of the inauguration. I hope at that time to be false\nto nothing you have been taught to expect of me.\u201d\nOn the morning of the thirteenth, the party started for\nColumbus, the capital of Ohio. The scenes of the previous\nday were repeated on the route, in the gathering of large\ncrowds at all the intermediate stations. The reception in\nColumbus had been a fortnight in preparation, the\nlegislature taking the initiative. At noon, on the thirteenth,\nit was calculated that \ufb01ve thousand strangers were in the\ncity. As the time approached for the arrival of the train, the\ncrowd around the depot became almost overwhelming. A\nthirty-four-gun salute announced the coming train, and as it\ndrove slowly into the depot, the crowd called upon the\nPresident elect to show himself. He stepped out upon the\nplatform of the rear car, and with head uncovered bowed\nhis acknowledgments to the hearty greeting he received.\nOn alighting and entering a carriage for the passage to the\nState House, the scenes at Cincinnati were re-enacted.\nStreets were full of people, the air was ringing with shouts\nand huzzas, and the same kind sun smiled upon all. He was\nreceived in the hall of the House of Representatives, and\nGovernor Dennison introduced him to the Legislature. The\nPresident of the Senate responded in a speech of welcome\nwhich so concisely and happily conveyed the feelings of the\npeople at that time, and so justly measured the nature and\nimportance of the crisis, that it deserves record. He\naddressed Mr. Lincoln in the following words:\n\u201cSir: On this day, and probably this very hour, the\nCongress of the United States will declare the verdict of\n the people, making you their President. It is my pleasurable\nduty, in behalf or the people of Ohio, speaking through this\nGeneral Assembly, to welcome you to their Capital. Never\nin the history of this Government has such fearful\nresponsibility rested upon the Chief Executive of the nation\nas will now devolve upon you. Never since the memorable\ntime our patriotic fathers gave existence to the American\nRepublic, have the people looked with such intensity of\nfeeling to the inauguration and future policy of a President,\nas they do to yours. I need not assure you that the people of\nOhio have full con\ufb01dence in your ability and patriotism, and\nwill respond to you in their loyalty to the Union and the\nConstitution. It would seem, sir, that the great problem of\nself-government is to be solved under your administration.\nAll nations are deeply interested in its solution, and they\nwait with breathless anxiety to know whether this form of\ngovernment, which has been the admiration of the world, is\nto be a failure or not. It is the earnest and united prayer of\nour people, that the same kind Providence which protected\nus in our colonial struggles, and has attended us thus far in\nour prosperity and greatness, will so imbue your mind with\nwisdom, that you may dispel the dark clouds that hang over\nour political horizon, and thereby secure the return of\nharmony and fraternal feeling to our now distracted and\nunhappy country. Again I bid you a cordial welcome to our\nCapital.\u201d\nTo this noble greeting Mr. Lincoln responded as follows:\n\u201cGentlemen of the Senate and Citizens of Ohio: It is true,\nas has been said by the President of the Senate, that very\n great responsibility rests upon me in the position to which\nthe votes of the American people have called me. I am\ndeeply sensible of that weighty responsibility. I cannot but\nknow, what you all know, that without a name-perhaps\nwithout a reason why I should have a name \u2014 there has\nfallen upon me a task such as did not rest upon the Father\nof his Country. And so feeling I cannot but turn and look for\nthe support without which it will be impossible for me to\nperform that great task. I turn, then, and look to the\nAmerican people, and to that God who has never forsaken\nthem.\n\u201cAllusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to\nthe policy of the new administration. In this I have received\nfrom some a degree of credit for having kept silence, from\nothers some depreciation. I still think I was right. In the\nvarying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the present,\nwithout a precedent which could enable me to judge from\nthe past, it has seemed \ufb01tting that before speaking upon\nthe di\ufb00iculties of the country I should have gained a view of\nthe whole \ufb01eld. To be sure, after all, I would be at liberty to\nmodify and change the course of policy, as future events\nmight make a change necessary.\n\u201cI have not maintained silence from any want of real\nanxiety. It is a good thing that there is no more than\nanxiety, for there is nothing going wrong. It is a consoling\ncircumstance that when we look out there is nothing that\nreally hurts anybody. We entertain di\ufb00erent views upon\npolitical questions, but nobody is su\ufb00ering anything. This is\na most consoling circumstance, and from it I judge that all\n we want is time and patience, and a reliance on that God\nwho has never forsaken this people.\u201d\nThe reporter for the Ohio State Journal, describing the\nincidents of the day, says that the impression produced by\nthe President elect was most agreeable. \u201cHis great hight,\u201d\nhe continues, \u201cwas conspicuous, even in that crowd of\ngoodly men, and lifted him fully in view as he walked up the\naisle. When he took the speaker\u2019s stand, a better\nopportunity was a\ufb00orded to look at the man upon whom\nmore hopes hang than upon any other living. At \ufb01rst, the\nkindness and amiability of his face strikes you; but as he\nspeaks, the greatness and determination of his nature are\napparent. Something in his manner, even more than in his\nwords, told how deeply he was a\ufb00ected by the enthusiasm\nof the people; and when he appealed to them for\nencouragement and support, every heart responded with\nmute assurance of both. There was the simplicity of\ngreatness in his unassuming and con\ufb01ding manner, that\nwon its way to instant admiration. He looked somewhat\nworn with travel and the fatigues of popularity, but warmed\nto the cordiality of his reception.\u201d\nAfter the conclusion of the formalities in the hall, Mr.\nLincoln went to the western steps of the Capitol, to say a\nword to the people. The address he made here consisted\nsimply of commonplaces and phrases that had already\nbecome hackneyed. The hand-shaking that succeeded was\nsomething fearful. Every man in the crowd was anxious to\nwrench the hand of Abraham Lincoln. He \ufb01nally gave both\nhands to the work, with great good nature. To quote one of\n the reports of the occasion: \u201cpeople plunged at his arms\nwith frantic enthusiasm, and all the in\ufb01nite variety of\nshakes, from the wild and irrepressible pump-handle\nmovement, to the dead grip, was executed upon the\ndevoted dexter and sinister of the president. Some glanced\nat his face as they grasped his hand; others invoked the\nblessings of Heaven upon him; others a\ufb00ectionately gave\nhim their last gasping assurance of devotion; others,\nbewildered and furious, with hats crushed over their eyes,\nseized his hands in a convulsive grasp, and passed on as if\nthey had not the remotest idea who, what, or where they\nwere.\u201d The President at last escaped, and took refuge in\nthe Governor\u2019s residence, although he held a levee at the\nState House in the evening, where, in a more quiet way, he\nmet many prominent citizens.\nOn the fourteenth, the presidential party left Columbus,\nfor Pittsburgh. The morning was rainy, but large numbers\nwitnessed the departure of the train, and assembled at the\nstations along the route. At Steubenville, about \ufb01ve\nthousand people had assembled, and these Mr. Lincoln\nbrie\ufb02y addressed. The rain interfered very materially with\nthe proposed reception at Pittsburgh, as did also the\ndarkness, for it was night when the party arrived. At the\nMonongahela House, Mr. Lincoln addressed a large\nconcourse of people in a few words of acknowledgment,\nand deferred his more formal remarks until the morning of\nthe \ufb01fteenth. These latter were not charged with particular\ninterest. They were rather an apology for not speaking at\nall, upon the great subject of which all wished to hear, than\n any exposition of opinion or policy upon any subject. A\nsingle paragraph showed that he still deemed a peaceful\nsolution of the national di\ufb00iculties possible:\n\u201cNotwithstanding the troubles across the river, there is\nreally no crisis springing from anything in the Government\nitself. In plain words, there is really no crisis except an\narti\ufb01cial one. What is there now to warrant the condition of\na\ufb00airs presented by our friends over the river? Take even\ntheir own view of the questions involved, and there is\nnothing to justify the course which they are pursuing. I\nrepeat it, then, there is no crisis, except such a one as may\nbe gotten up at any time by turbulent men, aided by\ndesigning \npoliticians. \nMy \nadvice, \nthen, \nunder \nsuch\ncircumstances, is to keep cool. If the great American people\nwill only keep their temper on both sides of the line, the\ntrouble will come to an end, and the question which now\ndistracts the country will be settled just as surely as all\nother di\ufb00iculties of like character which have originated in\nthis Government have been adjusted. Let the people on\nboth sides keep their self-possession, and just as other\nclouds have cleared away in due time, so will this, and this\ngreat nation shall continue to prosper as heretofore.\u201d\nThe next place at which he was to be received was\nCleveland, Ohio; and the party set out for this beautiful city\nin a hard shower of rain, that had not the power to dampen\nthe enthusiasm of the Pittsburgh people who cheered their\ndeparting guests with great heartiness. There were the\nusual incidents along the road, and at four o\u2019clock the train\narrived at the Euclid Street Station of the Cleveland and\n Pittsburgh Railroad, where a very large escort waited to\nconduct Mr. Lincoln to the Weddell House. The President\ntook his seat in a carriage drawn by four white horses.\nNotwithstanding the unpleasantness of the weather, Euclid\nStreet was crowded from one end to the other, with persons\nwho acted almost like wild men, in their anxiety to catch a\nglimpse of the President. Mr. I.U. Masters, the President of\nthe City Council, made a formal speech of welcome, and\nwas followed by Hon. Sherlock G. Andrews, who welcomed\nthe guest of the occasion on behalf of the citizens\u2019\ncommittee. Here, in his response, Mr. Lincoln repeated the\nsubstance of the remarks he made at Pittsburgh about the\narti\ufb01cial nature of the crisis that was upon the country. \u201cIt\nwas not argued up,\u201d he said, \u201cand cannot, therefore, be\nargued down. Let it alone and it will go down of itself.\u201d In\nthese remarks, and in all like these, he must have taken\ncounsel of his hopes rather than his convictions; for in the\nsame speech, while alluding to the grateful fact that his\nreception was by the citizens generally, without distinction\nof party, he said: \u201cIf all don\u2019t join now to save the good old\nship of the Union this voyage, nobody will have a chance to\npilot her on another voyage.\u201d There was a general\nreception and hand-shaking in the evening, and after the\ndistinguished guest had become too tired for further\nhonors, he was permitted to retire for the night.\nEarly the next morning the party took their leave, but\nthey found many up and ready to get a parting glance of\nMr. Lincoln, who, taking his seat in the rear car, appeared\nupon the platform as the train moved out of the depot, and\n bowed his farewell to the people who had so generously\nand cordially received him. His next public reception was at\nBu\ufb00alo, where he arrived late in the afternoon of the\nsixteenth, having received all along the route those\ntestimonials of interest which had come to be as wearisome\nat last, as they were grateful at the \ufb01rst. On the arrival of\nthe train at Bu\ufb00alo, Mr. Lincoln was met by a very large\nconcourse of citizens, with Ex-President Fillmore at their\nhead. After being conducted to his hotel, the acting mayor\ngave him a formal welcome, to which Mr. Lincoln\nresponded with hearty thanks, and such phrases of apology\nfor not saying anything as had already become threadbare,\nand with his often repeated promise to say what the people\nwished to hear, when he should be called upon to do it\no\ufb00icially.\nFrom Bu\ufb00alo, Mr. Lincoln and his party proceeded to\nAlbany, receiving many demonstrations of respect from the\nbeautiful cities along the route of three hundred miles. At\nAlbany he was welcomed by Governor Morgan, to whom he\nmade a brief response; and then he was conducted into the\npresence of the legislature, where he had another formal\nreception. To the speech addressed to him here, he made\nan unusually graceful and feeling response. He said:\n\u201cIt is with feelings of great di\ufb00idence, and, I may say,\nfeelings even of awe, perhaps greater than I have recently\nexperienced, that I meet you here in this place. The history\nof this great state, the renown of its great men, who have\nstood in this chamber, and have spoken their thoughts, all\ncrowd around my fancy, and incline me to shrink from an\n attempt to address you. Yet I have some con\ufb01dence given\nme by the generous manner in which you have invited me,\nand the still more generous manner in which you have\nreceived me. You have invited me and received me without\ndistinction of party. I could not for a moment suppose that\nthis has been done in any considerable degree with any\nreference to my personal self. It is very much more grateful\nto me that this reception and the invitation preceding it\nwere given to me as the representative of a free people\nthan it could possibly have been were they but the evidence\nof devotion to me or to any one man.\n\u201cIt is true that, while I hold myself, without mock-modesty,\nthe humblest of all the individuals who have ever been\nelected President of the United States, I yet have a more\ndi\ufb00icult task to perform than any one of them has ever\nencountered. You have here generously tendered me the\nsupport, the united support, of the great Empire State. For\nthis, in behalf of the nation \u2014 in behalf of the present and\nof the future of the nation \u2014 in behalf of the cause of civil\nliberty in all time to come \u2014 I most gratefully thank you. I\ndo not propose now to enter upon any expressions as to the\nparticular line of policy to be adopted with reference to the\ndi\ufb00iculties that stand before us, in the opening of the\nincoming administration. I deem that it is just to the\ncountry, to myself, to you, that I should see everything, hear\neverything, and have every light that can possibly be\nbrought within my reach to aid me before I shall speak\no\ufb00icially, in order that, when I do speak, I may have the\nbest possible means of taking correct and true grounds. For\n this reason, I do not now announce anything in the way of\npolicy for the new administration. When the time comes,\naccording to the custom of the government, I shall speak,\nand speak as well as I am able for the good of the present\nand of the future of this country \u2014 for the good of the\nNorth and of the South \u2014 for the good of one and of the\nother, and of all sections of it. In the meantime, if we have\npatience, it we maintain our equanimity, though some may\nallow themselves to run o\ufb00 in a burst of passion, I still have\ncon\ufb01dence that the Almighty Ruler of the universe, through\nthe instrumentality of this great and intelligent people, can\nand will bring us through this di\ufb00iculty, as he has\nheretofore brought us through all preceding di\ufb00iculties of\nthe country. Relying upon this, and again thanking you, as I\nforever shall, in my heart, for this generous reception you\nhave given me, I bid you farewell.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln was met at Albany by a delegation of the city\ngovernment of New York, and started on the nineteenth for\nthe great metropolis. He was not permitted to pass by\nPoughkeepsie without a formal welcome from the mayor of\nthat city, to which he made a formal response. In this little\nspeech there is a manifest improvement upon the earlier\ne\ufb00orts of the route. Mr. Lincoln had found that there were\nthings to talk about besides policy, and that it was better to\nyield himself up to the impulse of the moment than to be\nunder the constant fear of saying some imprudent thing,\nconcerning the character of the crisis and the policy of the\nincoming administration.\n The reception at the city of New York was such as only\nNew York can give. Places of business were generally\nclosed, and the streets presented such crowds as only a city\nnumbering a million of people can produce. Here he was\nformally received by Fernando Wood, then mayor of the\ncity, to whose welcome he made the following response:\n\u201cMr. Mayor: \u2014 It is with feelings of deep gratitude that I\nmake my acknowledgments for the reception given me in\nthe great commercial city of New York. I cannot but\nremember that this is done by a people who do not, by a\nmajority, agree with me in political sentiment. It is the more\ngrateful, because in this I see that, for the great principles\nof our Government, the people are almost unanimous. In\nregard to the di\ufb00iculties that confront us at this time, and\nof which your Honor has thought \ufb01t to speak so becomingly\nand so justly, as I suppose, I can only say that I agree in the\nsentiments expressed. In my devotion to the Union, I hope I\nam behind no man in the nation. In the wisdom with which\nto conduct the a\ufb00airs tending to the preservation of the\nUnion, I fear that too great con\ufb01dence may have been\nreposed in me; but I am sure that I bring a heart devoted to\nthe work. There is nothing that could ever bring me to\nwillingly consent to the destruction of this Union, under\nwhich not only the great commercial city of New York, but\nthe whole country, acquired its greatness, except it be the\npurpose for which the Union itself was formed. I\nunderstand the ship to be made for the carrying and the\npreservation of the cargo, and so long as the ship can be\nsaved with the cargo, it should never be abandoned, unless\n there appears no possibility of its preservation, and it must\ncease to exist, except at the risk of throwing overboard\nboth freight and passengers. So long, then, as it is possible\nthat the prosperity and the liberties of the people be\npreserved in this Union, it shall be my purpose at all times\nto use all my powers to aid in its perpetuation.\u201d\nOn the twentieth, Mr. Lincoln left New York for\nPhiladelphia, visiting on the way both Houses of the New\nJersey Legislature at Trenton. From the speech made\nbefore the Senate on this occasion, a quotation has been\nmade in this volume, and the entire passage is worthy of\nrecord:\n\u201cI cannot but remember the place that New Jersey holds\nin our early history. In the early Revolutionary struggle, few\nof the states among the old thirteen had more of the battle-\n\ufb01elds of the country within its limits than old New Jersey.\nMay I be pardoned, if, upon this occasion, I mention, that\naway back in my childhood, the earliest days of my being\nable to read, I got hold of a small book, such a one as few of\nthe younger members have ever seen, \u2018Weems\u2019 Life of\nWashington.\u2019 I remember all the accounts there given of\nthe battle-\ufb01elds and struggles for the liberties of the\ncountry, and none \ufb01xed themselves upon my imagination so\ndeeply as the struggle here at Trenton, New Jersey. The\ncrossing of the river \u2014 the contest with the Hessians \u2014 the\ngreat hardships endured at that time \u2014 all \ufb01xed themselves\non my memory more than any single revolutionary event;\nand you all know, for you have all been boys, how these\nearly impressions last longer than any others. I recollect\n thinking then, boy even though I was, that there must have\nbeen something more than common that those men\nstruggled for. I am exceedingly anxious that that thing\nwhich they struggled for \u2014 that something even more than\nNational Independence \u2014 that something that held out a\ngreat promise to all the people of the world to all time to\ncome \u2014 I am exceedingly anxious that this Union, the\nConstitution, and the liberties of the people, shall be\nperpetuated in accordance with the original idea for which\nthat struggle was made, and I shall be most happy indeed if\nI shall be an humble instrument in the hands of the\nAlmighty, and of this, his almost chosen people, for\nperpetuating the object of that great struggle.\u201d\nAt Philadelphia Mr. Lincoln was received with great\nenthusiasm, and many demonstrations of popular regard.\nHis formal welcome was given by the mayor of the city, but\nthere \nwas \nnothing \nin \nhis \nresponse \nthat \ncalls \nfor\nreproduction, except a single passage in which he hints at\nthe possibility that he may never be permitted to take the\npresidential chair. Alluding to the popular desire to learn\nsomething de\ufb01nite concerning his policy, he said, \u201cIt were\nuseless for me to speak of details of plans now; I shall\nspeak o\ufb00icially next Monday week, if ever. If I should not\nspeak then, it were useless for me to do so now.\u201d\nHe had been aware, ever since he left Spring\ufb01eld, that\nmen were seeking for his life. An attempt was made to\nthrow the train o\ufb00 the track that bore him out of\nSpring\ufb01eld; and at Cincinnati a hand grenade was found\nconcealed upon the train. The fear excited by these hostile\n demonstrations was an inde\ufb01nite one, but on his arrival at\nPhiladelphia the plot was all unfolded to him.\nBefore Mr. Lincoln left home it was whispered about that\nhe would never be permitted to pass through Baltimore\nalive; and a detective of great experience and skill was put\nto the task of ferreting out the conspiracy. He employed\nboth men and women to assist him, and found that a\nconspiracy was indeed in existence, with an Italian refugee,\na barber, at the head of it, who, assuming the name of\n\u201cOrsini,\u201d indicated the part he expected to play in the plot.\nIt was arranged, in case Mr. Lincoln should reach\nBaltimore safely, that, on a given signal, he should be shot\nby those who should gather in the guise of friends around\nhis carriage, and that hand grenades should complete the\nwork of destruction which the pistol had commenced. In\nthe confusion thus produced, the guilty parties proposed to\nescape to a vessel in waiting, which would convey them to\nMobile.\nThe detective and Mr. Lincoln reached Philadelphia\nnearly at the same time, and there the former submitted to\na few of the President\u2019s friends the information he had\nsecured. An interview between Mr. Lincoln and the\ndetective was immediately arranged, which took place in\nthe apartments of the former at the Continental Hotel. Mr.\nLincoln having heard the o\ufb00icer\u2019s statement in detail, then\ninformed him that he had promised to raise the American\n\ufb02ag on Independence Hall the following morning \u2014 the\nmorning of the anniversary of Washington\u2019s birthday \u2014 and\nthat he had accepted an invitation to a reception by the\n Pennsylvania legislature in the afternoon of the same day.\n\u201cBoth of these engagements I will keep,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln,\n\u201cif it costs me my life.\u201d For the rest, he authorized the\ndetective to make such arrangements as he thought proper\nfor his safe conduct to Washington.\nIn the meantime, General Scott and Senator Seward,\nboth \nof \nwhom \nwere \nin \nWashington, \nlearned \nfrom\nindependent sources that Mr. Lincoln\u2019s life was in danger,\nand concurred in sending Mr. Frederick W. Seward to\nPhiladelphia, to urge upon him the necessity of proceeding\nimmediately to Washington in a quiet way. The messenger\narrived late on Thursday night, after Mr. Lincoln had\nretired, and requested an audience. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s fears had\nalready been aroused, and he was cautious, of course, in\nthe matter of receiving a stranger. But satis\ufb01ed that the\nmessenger was indeed the son of Mr. Seward, he gave him\naudience. Nothing needed to be done, but to inform him of\nthe plan entered into with the detective by which the\nPresident was to arrive in Washington early on Saturday\nmorning, in advance of his family and party. This\ninformation was conveyed to Mr. Washburne of Illinois,\namong others, on Mr. Seward\u2019s return to Washington; and\nhe was deputed to receive Mr. Lincoln at the depot on his\narrival.\nSuch were the exciting events and disclosures of the day\nand \nnight \npreceding \nMr. \nLincoln\u2019s \nappearance \nat\nIndependence Hall, where he was formally received, and\nwhere he made the following address, one passage of\nwhich bears the burden of his apprehension:\n \u201cI am \ufb01lled with deep emotion at \ufb01nding myself standing\nhere, in this place, where were collected the wisdom, the\npatriotism, the devotion to principle, from which sprang the\ninstitutions under which we live. You have kindly suggested\nto me that in my hands is the task of restoring peace to the\npresent distracted condition of the country. I can say in\nreturn, sir, that all the political sentiments I entertain have\nbeen drawn, so far as I have been able to draw them, from\nthe sentiments which originated were given to the world\nfrom this hall. I have never had a feeling, politically, that\ndid not spring from the sentiments embodied in the\nDeclaration of Independence. I have often pondered over\nthe dangers which were incurred by the men who\nassembled here, and framed and adopted that Declaration\nof Independence. I have pondered over the toils that were\nendured by the o\ufb00icers and soldiers of the army who\nachieved that independence. I have often inquired of myself\nwhat great principle or idea it was that kept this\nConfederacy so long together. It was not the mere matter of\nthe separation of the colonies from the mother-land, but\nthat sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which\ngave liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but, I\nhope, to the world for all future time. It was that which\ngave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted\nfrom the shoulders of all men. This is a sentiment embodied\nin the Declaration of Independence. Now, my friends, can\nthis country be saved upon this basis? If it can, I will\nconsider myself one of the happiest men in the world if I\ncan help to save it. If it cannot be saved upon that\n principle, it will be truly awful. But if this country cannot be\nsaved without giving up that principle, I was about to say I\nwould rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it.\nNow, in my view of the present aspect of a\ufb00airs, there need\nbe no bloodshed or war. There is no necessity for it. I am\nnot in favor of such a course; and I may say, in advance,\nthat there will be no bloodshed unless it be forced upon the\nGovernment, and then it will be compelled to act in self-\ndefense.\u201d\nAt the conclusion of this speech, Mr. Lincoln was\nconducted to a platform outside, where he was publicly\ninvited to raise the new \ufb02ag. In responding to this\ninvitation, he addressed a few words to the people, and\nthen ran the \ufb02ag up to the top of the sta\ufb00, amid the cheers\nof a vast concourse of people. The ceremony was alike\nimpressive to the principal actor and the multitude of\nobservers. The great battles of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s life had been\ndone for the principles of the Declaration of Independence.\nIt \nwas \nbecause \nhe \nrepresented \nthose \nprinciples,\ndistinctively, that he had been elected to the presidency,\nthat the slave-power was in active revolt, and that the\nfriends of slavery were seeking for his life. It was certainly\na remarkable occasion when he stood within the room\nwhere the Declaration was framed and signed, and pledged\nhimself anew to its truths and principles, and then walked\nout into the presence of the people and ran up to its home\nthe beautiful national ensign prepared for his hands.\nAt the conclusion of these ceremonies, Mr. Lincoln and\nhis party left the city for Harrisburg, the capital of the\n state, where, in accordance with his promise, he visited\nboth \nbranches \nof \nthe \nPennsylvania \nlegislature. \nThe\nfollowing were the more important passages in his\nresponse to the address of welcome:\n\u201cI thank you most sincerely for this reception, and the\ngenerous words in which support has been promised me\nupon this occasion. I thank your great Commonwealth for\nthe overwhelming support it recently gave, not to me\npersonally, but the cause, which I think a just one, in the\nlate election. Allusion has been made to the fact \u2014 the\ninteresting fact, perhaps we should say \u2014 that I, for the\n\ufb01rst time, appear at the capital of the great Commonwealth\nof Pennsylvania upon the birthday of the Father of his\nCountry, in connection with that beloved anniversary\nconnected with the history of this country. I have already\ngone through one exceedingly interesting scene this\nmorning in the ceremonies at Philadelphia. Under the high\nconduct of gentlemen there, I was, for the \ufb01rst time,\nallowed the privilege of standing in Old Independence Hall,\nto have a few words addressed to me there, and opening up\nan opportunity of saying, with much regret, that I had not\nmore time to express something of my own feelings, excited\nby the occasion \u2014 somewhat to harmonize and give shape\nto the feelings that had been really the feelings of my whole\nlife.\n\u201cBesides this, our friends there had provided a\nmagni\ufb01cent \ufb02ag of the country. They had arranged it so\nthat I was given the honor of raising it to the head of its\nsta\ufb00. And when it went up I was pleased that it went to its\n place by the strength of my own feeble arm; when,\naccording to the arrangement, the cord was pulled, and it\n\ufb02aunted gloriously to the wind without an accident, in the\nbright glowing sunshine of the morning, I could not help\nhoping that there was in the entire success of that beautiful\nceremony at least something of an omen of what is to come.\nNor could I help feeling then, as I often have felt, that in\nthe whole of that proceeding I was a very humble\ninstrument. I had not provided the \ufb02ag; I had not made the\narrangements for elevating it to its place. I had applied but\na very small portion of my feeble strength in raising it. In\nthe whole transaction I was in the hands of the people who\nhad arranged it; and if I can have the same generous co-\noperation of the people of the nation, I think the \ufb02ag of our\ncountry may yet be kept \ufb02aunting gloriously.\n\u201cI recur for a moment to some words uttered at the hotel\nin regard to what has been said about the military support\nwhich the general government may expect from the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania in a proper emergency. To\nguard against any possible mistake do I recur to this. It is\nnot with any pleasure that I contemplate the possibility that\na necessity may arise in this country for the use of the\nmilitary arm. While I am exceedingly grati\ufb01ed to see the\nmanifestation upon your streets of your military force here,\nand exceedingly grati\ufb01ed at your promise here to use that\nforce upon a proper emergency \u2014 while I make these\nacknowledgments, I desire to repeat, in order to preclude\nany possible misconstruction, that I do most sincerely hope\nthat we shall have no use for them; that it will never\n become their duty to shed blood, and most especially never\nto shed fraternal blood. I promise that, so far as I may have\nwisdom to direct, if so painful a result shall in any wise be\nbrought about, it shall be through no fault of mine.\u201d\nIt is proper to call renewed attention here to Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s strong and ever present conviction that he was\nonly a humble instrument in the hands of a higher power.\nHe recognized the people as one of the higher powers\nwhich held him in service, and his illustration of his\nposition, drawn from his o\ufb00ice in raising the \ufb02ag over\nIndependence Hall, was extremely beautiful. We shall \ufb01nd\nthis conviction deepening throughout the remainder of his\nlife \u2014 the conviction that he was nothing \u2014 that he was of\nno consequence \u2014 save as an instrument, and that he had\nno rights and no mission except those which were deputed\nto him.\nAt the conclusion of the exercises of the day, Mr. Lincoln,\nwho was known to be very weary, was permitted to pass\nundisturbed to his apartments in the Jones House. It was\npopularly understood that he was to start for Washington\nthe next morning; and the people of Harrisburg supposed\nthey had taken only a temporary leave of him. He remained\nin his rooms until nearly six o\u2019clock, when he passed into\nthe street, entered a carriage unobserved, in company with\nColonel Lamon, and was driven to a special train on the\nPennsylvania Railroad, in waiting for him. As a measure of\nprecaution, the telegraph wires were cut the moment he\nleft Harrisburgh, so that, if his departure should be\ndiscovered, intelligence of it could not be communicated at\n a distance. At half past ten, the train arrived at\nPhiladelphia, and here Mr. Lincoln was met by the\ndetective, who had a carriage in readiness, in which the\nparty were driven to the depot of the Philadelphia,\nWilmington and Baltimore Railroad. At a quarter past\neleven they arrived, and, very fortunately, found the regular\ntrain, which should have left at eleven, delayed. The party\ntook berths in the sleeping car, and, without change of cars,\npassed directly through Baltimore to Washington, where\nMr. Lincoln arrived at half past six o\u2019clock in the morning,\nand found Mr. Washburne anxiously awaiting him. He was\ntaken into a carriage, and in a few minutes he was talking\nover his adventures, with Senator Seward at Willard\u2019s\nHotel.\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s family left Harrisburgh on the special train\nthat had been intended for him; and as news of his safe\narrival in Washington was already telegraphed over the\ncountry, no disturbance was made by the passage of the\nparty through Baltimore. It was found that the number of\noriginal conspirators was about twenty, all of whose names\nwere in possession of responsible parties. It was a bold\nplot, ingeniously foiled; but the detective through whose\nmeans the President\u2019s life had been saved, was not\nconsidered safe in Washington, and after a day or two was\nsent away. It should be added that the current story that\nMr. Lincoln passed through Baltimore disguised in a \u201clong\nmilitary cloak and Scotch cap,\u201d is a pure fabrication,\nwritten by a man who hated Mr. Lincoln, and knew\n absolutely nothing of the event of which he wrote. Mr.\nLincoln did not \ufb01nd it necessary to adopt any disguise.\nIt is a curious coincidence that Mr. Seward and his son\nwho both were very active in the discovery of this plot, and\nin the measures for avoiding its consequences, were the\nonly sharers in that violence which, at a later period,\ndestroyed Mr. Lincoln\u2019s life. It is also a very suggestive fact,\ntouching the responsibility of the southern leaders for Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s assassination, that when a man of the name of\nByrne was arrested in Richmond a year afterwards, for\nkeeping a gambling house and for disloyalty to the\nconfederate government, he was released on the testimony\nof Mr. Wigfall, who, to prove the man\u2019s truth to treason,\nswore that he was captain of the band that plotted to\nassassinate President Lincoln in Baltimore.\nThe city of Washington was thrown into a \ufb02utter of\nexcitement by this unexpected arrival. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s foes \u2014\nand there were multitudes of them in Washington \u2014\nridiculed his fears, and his friends were equally angry and\nashamed that the chosen chief of the nation should consent\nto sneak into his capital; but the latter, sooner or later,\nlearned that he had taken the wiser course. It was, indeed,\na very shameful thing that the President elect should have\nbeen obliged to do what he did, but so long as he was not\nresponsible for it, the shame in no way attaches to him.\nMr. Lincoln went immediately into free conferences with\nhis friends, visited both houses of Congress, and after a day\nhe was waited upon by the Mayor and the municipal\nauthorities, who gave him formal welcome to the city. In his\n brief reply, he took occasion to say that he thought much of\nthe ill feeling existing between those living in free and\nslave states was owing to their failure to understand one\nanother, and then assured the Mayor and his party that he\ndid not then entertain, and had never entertained, any\nother than kindly feelings toward the South, that he had no\ndisposition to treat the people of the South otherwise than\nas his own neighbors, and that he had no wish to withhold\nfrom them any of the bene\ufb01ts of the Constitution. On the\nsecond evening after his arrival, the Republican Association\ntendered him the courtesy of a serenade, which attracted a\nlarge crowd of friends and curious spectators. On being\ncalled out, he made much such an address as he had\nalready made to the Mayor, closing with an expression of\nthe conviction that when they should come to know each\nother better they would be better friends.\nThe days that preceded the inauguration were rapidly\npassing away. In the meantime, although General Scott had\nbeen busy and e\ufb00icient in his military preparations for the\noccasion, many were fearful that scenes of violence would\nbe enacted on that day, even should Mr. Lincoln be\npermitted to escape assassination in the meantime. It was a\ntime of fearful uncertainty. The leading society of\nWashington hated Mr. Lincoln and the principles he\nrepresented. If it would be uncharitable to say that they\nwould have rejoiced in his death, it is certainly true that\nthey were in perfect sympathy with those who were\nplotting his destruction. His coming and remaining would\nbe death to the social dominance of slavery in the national\n capital. This they felt; and nothing would have pleased\nthem better than a revolution which would send Mr. Lincoln\nback to Illinois, and install Je\ufb00erson Davis in the White\nHouse. There was probably not one man in \ufb01ve in\nWashington at the time Mr. Lincoln entered the city who, in\nhis heart, gave him welcome. It is not to be wondered at\nthat his friends all over the country looked nervously\nforward to the fourth of March.\n   ha ter   III.\nTHE MORNING OF the fourth of March broke beautifully\nclear, and it found General Scott and the Washington police\nin readiness for the day. The friends of Mr. Lincoln had\ngathered in from far and near, determined that he should\nbe inaugurated. In the hearts of the surging crowds there\nwas anxiety; but outside, all looked as usual on such\noccasions, with the single exception of an extraordinary\ndisplay of soldiers. The public buildings, the schools and\nmost of the places of business were closed during the day,\nand the stars and stripes were \ufb02oating from every \ufb02ag-sta\ufb00.\nThere was a great desire to hear Mr. Lincoln\u2019s inaugural;\nand, at an early hour, Pennsylvania Avenue was full of\npeople, wending their way to the east front of the capitol,\nfrom which it was to be delivered.\nAt \ufb01ve minutes before twelve o\u2019clock, Vice-President\nBreckinridge and Senator Foote escorted Mr. Hamlin, the\nVice-President elect, into the Senate Chamber, and gave\nhim a seat at the left of the chair. At twelve, Mr.\nBreckinridge announced the Senate adjourned without day,\nand then conducted Mr. Hamlin to the seat he had vacated.\nAt this moment, the foreign diplomats, of whom there was a\nvery large and brilliant representation, entered the\nchamber, and took the seats assigned to them. At a quarter\nbefore one o\u2019clock, the Judges of the Supreme Court\n entered, with the venerable Chief Justice Taney at their\nhead, each exchanging salutes with the new Vice-President,\nas they took their seats. At a quarter past one o\u2019clock, an\nunusual stir and excitement announced the coming of the\nmost important personage of the occasion. It was a relief to\nmany to know that he was safely within the building; and\nthose who were assembled in the hall regarded with the\nprofoundest interest the entrance of President Buchanan\nand the President elect \u2014 the outgoing and the incoming\nman. A procession was then formed which passed to the\nplatform erected for the ceremonies of the occasion, in the\nfollowing order: Marshal of the District of Columbia, Judges\nof the Supreme Court and Sergeant-at-Arms, Senate\nCommittee of Arrangements, President of the United States\nand President elect, Vice-President, Clerk of the Senate,\nSenators, \nDiplomatic \nCorps, \nheads \nof \ndepartments,\nGovernors of states, and such others as were in the\nchamber. On arriving at the platform, Senator Baker of\nOregon, whose name as one of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s old friends and\npolitical rivals in Illinois has been frequently mentioned in\nthis volume, introduced Mr. Lincoln to the assembly. There\nwas not a very hearty welcome given to the President, as\nhe stepped forward to read his inaugural. His enemies were\ntoo many: and his friends too much in fear of exasperating\nthem. The representative of American loyalty carried his\nburden alone. The inaugural was listened to with profound\nattention, every passage being vociferously cheered which\ncontained any allusion to the Union, and none listening\nmore carefully than Mr. Buchanan and Judge Taney, the\n latter of whom, with much agitation, administered the oath\nof o\ufb00ice to Mr. Lincoln when his address was concluded.\nMr. Lincoln himself must have wondered at the strange\nconjunction of personages and events. The \u201cStephen\u201d of his\n\ufb01rst speech in the old senatorial campaign was a defeated\ncandidate for the presidency who then stood patriotically at\nhis side, holding the hat of the republican President, which\nhe had politely taken at the beginning of the inaugural\naddress; \u201cJames\u201d had just walked out of o\ufb00ice to make\nroom for him; \u201cFranklin\u201d had passed into comparative\nobscurity or something worse, and \u201cRoger\u201d had just\nadministered to him the oath of o\ufb00ice.\nNo thorough understanding of the moderate and\nconciliatory tone of the inaugural can be acquired without a\nperusal of the document itself. Its arguments were\nunanswerable, and its tone of respectful friendliness\ntoward the South so marked that great pains were\nsubsequently taken by the southern press to misrepresent\nit, and to counteract its e\ufb00ects. Mr. Lincoln said:\n\u201cFellow-Citizens of the United States: \u2014 In compliance\nwith a custom as old as the government itself, I appear\nbefore you to address you brie\ufb02y, and to take, in your\npresence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the\nUnited States to be taken by the President before he enters\non the execution of his o\ufb00ice.\n\u201cI do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to\ndiscuss those matters of administration about which there\nis no special anxiety or excitement. Apprehension seems to\nexist among the people of the southern states, that, by the\n accession of a republican administration, their property\nand \ntheir \npeace \nand \npersonal \nsecurity \nare \nto \nbe\nendangered. There has never been any reasonable cause\nfor such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to\nthe contrary has all the while existed, and been open to\ntheir inspection. It is found in nearly all the published\nspeeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote\nfrom one of those speeches, when I declare that \u2018I have no\npurpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the\ninstitution of slavery in the states where it exists.\u2019 I believe\nI have no lawful right to do so; and I have no inclination to\ndo so. Those who nominated and elected me did so with the\nfull knowledge that I had made this, and made many similar\ndeclarations, and had never recanted them. And, more than\nthis, they placed in the platform, for my acceptance, and as\na law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic\nresolution which I now read:\n\u201c \u2018Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights\nof the states, and especially the right of each state to order\nand control its own domestic institutions according to its\nown judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of\npower on which the perfection and endurance of our\npolitical fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless\ninvasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory,\nno matter under what pretext, as among the gravest of\ncrimes.\u2019\n\u201cI now reiterate these sentiments; and in doing so I only\npress upon the public attention the most conclusive\nevidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property,\n peace, and security of no section are to be in anywise\nendangered by the now incoming administration.\n\u201cI add, too, that all the protection which, consistently\nwith the Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be\ncheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded,\nfor whatever cause, as cheerfully to one section as to\nanother.\n\u201cThere is much controversy about the delivering up of\nfugitives from service or labor. The clause I now read is as\nplainly written in the Constitution as any other of its\nprovisions:\n\u201c\u2018No person held to service or labor in one state under\nthe \nlaw \nthereof, \nescaping \ninto \nanother, \nshall, \nin\nconsequence \nof \nany \nlaw \nor \nregulation \ntherein, \nbe\ndischarged from such service or labor, but shall be\ndelivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or\nlabor may be due.\u2019\n\u201cIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was\nintended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what\nwe call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is\nthe law.\n\u201cAll members of Congress swear their support to the\nwhole Constitution \u2014 to this provision as well as any other.\nTo the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come\nwithin the terms of this clause \u2018shall be delivered up,\u2019 their\noaths are unanimous. Now, if they would make the e\ufb00ort in\ngood temper, could they not, with nearly equal unanimity,\nframe and pass a law by means of which to keep good that\nunanimous oath?\n \u201cThere is some di\ufb00erence of opinion whether this clause\nshould be enforced by national or by state authority; but\nsurely that di\ufb00erence is not a very material one. If the slave\nis to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to\nhim or to others by which authority it is done; and should\nany one, in any case, be content that this oath shall go\nunkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it\nshall be kept?\n\u201cAgain, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the\nsafeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane\njurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not,\nin any case, surrendered as a slave? And might it not be\nwell at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement\nof that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\n\u2018the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the\nprivileges and immunities of citizens in the several states?\u2019\n\u201cI take the o\ufb00icial oath to-day with no mental\nreservations, and with no purpose to construe the\nConstitution or laws by any hypercritical rules; and while I\ndo not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as\nproper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much\nsafer for all, both in o\ufb00icial and private stations, to conform\nto and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed, than\nto violate any of them, trusting to \ufb01nd impunity in having\nthem held to be unconstitutional.\n\u201cIt is seventy-two years since the \ufb01rst inauguration of a\nPresident under our national Constitution. During that\nperiod \ufb01fteen di\ufb00erent and very distinguished citizens have\nin succession administered the executive branch of the\n government. They have conducted it through many perils,\nand generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope for\nprecedent, I now enter upon the same task, for the brief\nconstitutional term of four years, under great and peculiar\ndi\ufb00iculties.\n\u201cA disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only\nmenaced, is now formidably attempted. I hold that in the\ncontemplation of universal law and of the Constitution, the\nUnion of these states is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if\nnot expressed, in the fundamental law of all national\ngovernments. It is safe to assert that no government proper\never had a provision in its organic law for its own\ntermination. Continue to execute all the express provisions\nof our national Constitution, and the Union will endure\nforever, it being impossible to destroy it except by some\naction not provided for in the instrument itself.\n\u201cAgain, if the United States be not a government proper,\nbut an association of states in the nature of a contract\nmerely, can it, as a contract, be peaceably unmade by less\nthan all the parties who made it? One party to a contract\nmay violate it \u2014 break it, so to speak; but does it not\nrequire all to lawfully rescind it? Descending from these\ngeneral principles, we \ufb01nd the proposition that in legal\ncontemplation the Union is perpetual, con\ufb01rmed by the\nhistory of the Union itself.\n\u201cThe Union is much older than the Constitution. It was\nformed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in . It\nwas \nmatured \nand \ncontinued \nin \nthe \nDeclaration \nof\nIndependence in . It was further matured, and the\n faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and\nengaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of the\nConfederation, in ; and, \ufb01nally, in , one of the\ndeclared objects for ordaining and establishing the\nConstitution was to form a more perfect union. But if the\ndestruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the\nstates be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than\nbefore, the Constitution having lost the vital element of\nperpetuity.\n\u201cIt follows from these views that no state, upon its own\nmere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union; that\nresolves and ordinances to that e\ufb00ect are legally void; and\nthat acts of violence within any state or states against the\nauthority of the United States are insurrectionary or\nrevolutionary, according to circumstances.\n\u201cI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and\nthe laws, the Union is unbroken, and, to the extent of my\nability, I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly\nenjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union shall be\nfaithfully executed in all the states. Doing this, which I\ndeem to be only a simple duty on my part, I shall perfectly\nperform it, so far as is practicable, unless my rightful\nmasters, \nthe \nAmerican \npeople, \nshall \nwithhold \nthe\nrequisition, or in some authoritative manner direct the\ncontrary.\n\u201cI trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as\nthe \ndeclared \npurpose \nof \nthe \nUnion \nthat \nit \nwill\nconstitutionally defend and maintain itself.\n \u201cIn doing this there need be no bloodshed or violence,\nand there shall be none unless it is forced upon the national\nauthority.\n\u201cThe power con\ufb01ded to me will be used to hold, occupy,\nand possess the property and places belonging to the\ngovernment, and collect the duties and imposts; but beyond\nwhat may be necessary for these objects there will be no\ninvasion, no using of force against or among the people\nanywhere.\n\u201cWhere hostility to the United States shall be so great\nand so universal as to prevent competent resident citizens\nfrom holding federal o\ufb00ices, there will be no attempt to\nforce obnoxious strangers among the people that object.\nWhile strict legal right may exist of the government to\nenforce the exercise of these o\ufb00ices, the attempt to do so\nwould be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal,\nthat I deem it best to forego for the time the uses of such\no\ufb00ices.\n\u201cThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished\nin all parts of the Union.\n\u201cSo far as possible, the people everywhere shall have\nthat sense of perfect security which is most favorable to\ncalm thought and re\ufb02ection.\n\u201cThe course here indicated will be followed, unless\ncurrent events and experience shall show a modi\ufb01cation or\nchange to be proper; and in every case and exigency my\nbest discretion will be exercised according to the\ncircumstances actually existing, and with a view and hope\n of a peaceful solution of the national troubles, and the\nrestoration of fraternal sympathies and a\ufb00ections.\n\u201cThat there are persons, in one section or another, who\nseek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any\npretext to do it, I will neither a\ufb00irm nor deny. But if there\nbe such, I need address no word to them.\n\u201cTo those, however, who really love the Union, may I not\nspeak, before entering upon so grave a matter as the\ndestruction of our national fabric, with all its bene\ufb01ts, its\nmemories, and its hopes? Would it not be well to ascertain\nwhy we do it? Will you hazard so desperate a step, while\nany portion of the ills you \ufb02y from have no real existence?\nWill you, while the certain ills you \ufb02y to are greater than all\nthe real ones you \ufb02y from? Will you risk the commission of\nso fearful a mistake? All profess to be content in the Union\nif all constitutional rights can be maintained. Is it true,\nthen, that any right, plainly written in the Constitution, has\nbeen denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is so\nconstituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing\nthis.\n\u201cThink, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly-\nwritten provision of the Constitution has ever been denied.\nIf, by the mere force of numbers. a majority should deprive\na minority of any clearly-written constitutional right, it\nmight, in a moral point of view, justify revolution; it\ncertainly would, if such right were a vital one. But sUch is\nnot our case.\n\u201cAll the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so\nplainly assured to them by a\ufb00irmations and negations,\n guaranties and prohibitions in the Constitution, that\ncontroversies never arise concerning them. But no organic\nlaw can ever be framed with a provision speci\ufb01cally\napplicable to every question which may occur in practical\nadministration. No foresight can anticipate, nor any\ndocument of reasonable length contain, express provisions\nfor all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor be\nsurrendered by national or by state authorities? The\nConstitution does not expressly say. Must Congress protect\nslavery in the territories? The Constitution does not\nexpressly say. From questions of this class, spring all our\nconstitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into\nmajorities and minorities.\n\u201cIf the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or\nthe government must cease. There is no alternative for\ncontinuing the government but acquiescence on the one\nside or the other. If a minority in such a case will secede\nrather than acquiesce, they make a precedent, which, in\nturn, will ruin and divide them, for a minority of their own\nwill secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be\ncontrolled by such a minority. For instance, why not any\nportion of a new confederacy, a year or two hence,\narbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the\npresent Union now claim to secede from it? All who cherish\ndisunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact\ntemper of doing this. Is there such perfect identity of\ninterests among the states to compose a new Union as to\nproduce harmony only, and prevent renewed secession?\n Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of\nanarchy.\n\u201cA majority held in restraint by constitutional check and\nlimitation, and always changing easily with deliberate\nchanges of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only\ntrue sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it, does, of\nnecessity, \ufb02y to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is\nimpossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent\narrangement, is wholly inadmissible. So that, rejecting the\nmajority principle, anarchy or despotism, in some form, is\nall that is left.\n\u201cI do not forget the position assumed by some that\nconstitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme\nCourt, nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in\nany case upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that\nsuit, while they are also entitled to a very high respect and\nconsideration in all parallel cases by all other departments\nof the government; and while it is obviously possible that\nsuch decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the\nevil e\ufb00ect following it, being limited to that particular case,\nwith the chance that it may be overruled an never become\na precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could\nthe evils of a di\ufb00erent practice.\n\u201cAt the same time the candid citizen must confess that, if\nthe policy of the government upon the vital question\na\ufb00ecting the whole people is to be irrevocably \ufb01xed by the\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made,\nas in ordinary litigation between parties in personal\nactions, the people will have ceased to be their own\n masters, unless having to that extent practically resigned\ntheir government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.\n\u201cNor is there in this view any assault upon the court or\nthe judges. It is a duty from which they may not shrink, to\ndecide cases properly brought before them; and it is no\nfault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to\npolitical purposes. One section of our country believes\nslavery is right, and ought to be extended, while the other\nbelieves it is wrong, and ought not to be extended, and this\nis the only substantial dispute; and the fugitive slave clause\nof the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the\nforeign slave trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as\nany law can ever be in a community where the moral sense\nof the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great\nbody of the people abide by the dry legal obligations in\nboth cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think,\ncannot be perfectly cured, and it would be worse, in both\ncases, after the separation of the sections, than before. The\nforeign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be\nultimately revived, without restriction, in one section; while\nfugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not\nbe surrendered at all by the other.\n\u201cPhysically speaking we can not separate; we can not\nremove our respective sections from each other, nor build\nan impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may\nbe divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond the\nreach of each other, but the di\ufb00erent parts of our country\ncannot do this. They can not but remain face to face; and\nintercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue\n between them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse\nmore advantageous or more satisfactory after separation\nthan before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends\ncan make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced\nbetween aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you\ngo to war, you cannot \ufb01ght always; and when, after much\nloss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease\n\ufb01ghting, the identical questions as to terms of intercourse\nare again upon you.\n\u201cThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people\nwho inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the\nexisting government, they can exercise their constitutional\nright \nof \namending, \nor \ntheir \nrevolutionary \nright \nto\ndismember or overthrow it. I can not be ignorant of the fact\nthat many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of\nhaving the national Constitution amended. While I make no\nrecommendation of amendment, I fully recognize the full\nauthority of the people over the whole subject, to be\nexercised in either of the modes prescribed in the\ninstrument \nitself, \nand \nI \nshould, \nunder \nexisting\ncircumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity\nbeing a\ufb00orded the people to act upon it.\n\u201cI will venture to add, that to me the convention mode\nseems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate\nwith the people themselves, instead of only permitting\nthem to take or reject propositions originated by others not\nespecially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be\nprecisely such as they would wish either to accept or\nrefuse. I understand that a proposed amendment to the\n Constitution (which amendment, however, I have not seen)\nhas passed Congress, to the e\ufb00ect that the federal\ngovernment shall never interfere with the domestic\ninstitutions of states, including that of persons held to\nservice. To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I\ndepart from my purpose not to speak of particular\namendments, so far as to say that, holding such a provision\nto now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to\nits being made express and irrevocable.\n\u201cThe chief magistrate derives all his authority from the\npeople, and they have conferred none upon him to \ufb01x the\nterms for the separation of the states. The people\nthemselves, also, can do this if they choose, but the\nexecutive, as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to\nadminister the present government as it came to his hands,\nand to transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor. Why\nshould there not be a patient con\ufb01dence in the ultimate\njustice of the people? Is there any better or equal hope in\nthe world? In our present di\ufb00erences is either party\nwithout faith of being in the right? If the Almighty Ruler of\nnations, with his eternal truth and justice, be on your side\nof the North, or on yours of the South, that truth and that\njustice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great\ntribunal, the American people. By the frame of the\ngovernment under which we live, this same people have\nwisely given their public servants but little power for\nmischief, and have with equal wisdom provided for the\nreturn of that little to their own hands at very short\nintervals. While the people retain their virtue and vigilance,\n no administration, by any extreme wickedness or folly, can\nvery seriously injure the government in the short space of\nfour years.\n\u201cMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon\nthis whole subject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking\ntime.\n\u201cIf there be an object to hurry any of you, in hot haste, to\na step which you would never take deliberately, that object\nwill be frustrated by taking time: but no good object can be\nfrustrated by it.\n\u201cSuch of you as are now dissatis\ufb01ed still have the old\nConstitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the\nlaws of your own framing under it; while the new\nadministration will have no immediate power, it it would, to\nchange either.\n\u201cIf it were admitted that you who are dissatis\ufb01ed hold\nthe right side in the dispute, there is still no single reason\nfor precipitate action. Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity,\nand a \ufb01rm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this\nfavored land, are still competent to adjust, in the best way,\nall our present di\ufb00iculties.\n\u201cIn your hands, my dissatis\ufb01ed fellow-countrymen, and\nnot in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The\ngovernment will not assail you.\n\u201cYou can have no con\ufb02ict without being yourselves the\naggressors. You have no oath registered in Heaven to\ndestroy the government; while I shall have the most solemn\none to \u2018preserve, protect, and defend\u2019 it.\n \u201cI am loth to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We\nmust not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it\nmust not break our bonds of a\ufb00ection.\n\u201cThe mystic cords of memory, stretching from every\nbattle-\ufb01eld and patriot grave to every living heart and\nhearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the\nchorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they\nwill be, by the better angels of our nature.\u201d\nThe address delivered and the oath administered, the\naugust ceremonies of the occasion were concluded; and,\npassing back through the Senate Chamber, the President\nwas escorted to the White House, where Mr. Buchanan took\nleave of him, and where the people were received by him in\nlarge numbers. Mr. Lincoln, on being asked whether he felt\nfrightened while delivering his address, in consequence of\nthe threats of assassination, replied that he had frequently\nexperienced greater fear in addressing a dozen western\nmen on the subject of temperance. Of one thing the \u201c\ufb01re-\neaters\u201d were assured by the address, viz: that if a war was\nto be inaugurated, they would be obliged to \ufb01re the \ufb01rst\ngun. Mr. Lincoln had pledged himself to take no step of\neven doubtful propriety. He proposed simply to possess and\nhold the property of the United States.\nAnd now began the great work of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s life. The\nhumble boy, reared in a log cabin, was the great man,\noccupying the proudest place in the nation, in the most\nperilous period of that nation\u2019s existence. He was in the\nWhite House as God\u2019s and the people\u2019s instrument, to work\nfor both.\n His \ufb01rst duty was the formal designation of a cabinet, for\nundoubtedly his choice of secretaries was essentially\nsettled in his own mind before he left home. The highest\nposition was o\ufb00ered to Mr. Seward, the \ufb01rst statesman in\nthe republican party, and the equal if not the superior of\nany in the country. Concerning the \ufb01lling of the o\ufb00ice of\nSecretary of State, it is believed that Mr. Lincoln had no\nhesitation. Mr. Seward was his \ufb01rst and last choice. With\nequal promptitude he decided to call Edward Bates of\nMissouri to the o\ufb00ice of Attorney General. Simon Cameron\nof Pennsylvania was known to be an aspirant for cabinet\nhonors; and, it is believed, would have accepted the post of\nSecretary of the Treasury with more alacrity than he did\nthat of Secretary of War, to which Mr. Lincoln called him.\nSalmon P. Chase of Ohio, who shared with Mr. Seward the\nhighest regards of the republican party and the con\ufb01dence\nof the country, was appointed to the Treasury. The men\nthus brought into the government were all prominent\ncandidates for the presidency at Chicago, and on the \ufb01rst\nballot received an aggregate of three hundred and twenty-\none votes of the four hundred and sixty-\ufb01ve cast. The great\nmajority of the party thus had the expression of their \ufb01rst\nchoice for the presidency honored by Mr. Lincoln in a\nremarkable degree. Gideon Welles of Connecticut was\nappointed Secretary of the Navy. Caleb B. Smith of Indiana,\nan old personal friend of Mr. Lincoln, and for many years a\ndistinguished politician of the West, was o\ufb00ered the\nPortfolio of the Interior, and accepted it; and Montgomery\nBlair of Maryland was appointed Postmaster General.\n Thus furnished with his secretaries, another most\nimportant work opened before him \u2014 the clearing the\ndepartments of the sympathizers with treason. This was\nindeed a Herculean task. Treason was everywhere. Every\ndepartment was infected. The men had been manipulated\nso long by treasonable hands \u2014 had been moulded into\nsuch thorough sympathy with the rebellion \u2014 and had so\nimbibed its treacherous spirit, that no measure could be\ndiscussed or adopted by the new administration that was\nnot reported to the rebels by some clerk or con\ufb01dant. The\ngovernment was betrayed every day by its own agents. Not\na step could be taken by Mr. Lincoln in any direction, that\nsome spy in the departments, or some traitor in his\ncon\ufb01dence, did not report to his enemies.\nThere were certain things that Mr. Lincoln specially\nendeavored to do in his inaugural address, and in all the\npreliminary work of his administration. He endeavored to\nshow that the rebellion was without an adequate cause \u2014\nto show this \ufb01rst to his own people, and then to the\ngovernments and peoples on the other side of the Atlantic.\nHe endeavored to leave no way untried that promised to\nprocure or preserve an honorable peace. He endeavored so\nto manage a\ufb00airs that whenever open hostilities should\ncome, they should be begun by the rebels and not by the\ngovernment. He intended to preserve for himself and for\nthe govemment a clean record. He intended to bear with\nthe rebellion just so long as it con\ufb01ned itself to paper \u2014\nnay, further than this \u2014 to bear with it to the silent\nsu\ufb00erance of many practical indignities. He did not mean to\n unsheath a sword, or \ufb01re a gun, until the rebellion\nabsolutely compelled him to do so. Yet, while waiting the\ndevelopment of events, he was very busily engaged in\nclearing the government for action. Many of the revelations\nand movements of the \ufb01rst few weeks would doubtless be\nstartling, even to-day, but the time has not yet come for\ntheir exposure.\nMr. Lincoln found not only the departments corrupt and\nunreliable, but he found the public mind abroad thoroughly\npoisoned against him, and fully in sympathy with the\nsecessionists. Perhaps a majority of the representatives of\nthe government in Europe were in the secrets of the\nseceders, and, in company with many who had gone from\nthe southern states to shape public opinion to the interests\nof treason, were doing everything in their power to injure\nthe government which had honored them. The places thus\ndisgraced and made instruments in the hands of treason\nwere to be \ufb01lled by loyal men; and a set of in\ufb02uences were\nto be put in motion which should secure respect for the\ngovernment, and a sound understanding of the merits of\nthe controversy between the government and slavery. To \ufb01ll\nthese places was not an easy task, but it was done quickly\nand, in the main, wisely.\nIt is proper here to give an explanation of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\npaci\ufb01c policy, at this time. Great fault was subsequently\nfound with him by the extremists among his northern\nfriends, for his deference to the border states; and a full\nunderstanding of his policy, as it related to these states,\ncannot be had without going back to this period when it\n was initiated. There were \ufb01fteen slave states, which those\nengaged in the rebellion hoped to lead or to force into\nsecession. At the time of the inauguration, only seven of\nthese \ufb01fteen \u2014 less than a majority \u2014 had revolted. The\ncotton states alone had followed the lead of South Carolina\nout of the Union. Several weeks had passed since a state\nhad seceded; and unless other states could be dragooned\ninto the movement, the rebellion would be practically a\nfailure from the start. Such a confederacy could not hope to\nlive a year, and would be obliged to \ufb01nd its way back into\nthe Union upon some terms. In the meantime, two or three\nconventions in the border states, delegated freshly from the\npeople, had voted distinctly and decidedly not to secede.\nThe a\ufb00airs of the confederacy were really in a very\nprecarious condition when Mr. Lincoln came into power.\nThe rebel government was making very much more bluster\nthan progress.\nIt became Mr. Lincoln\u2019s policy so to conduct a\ufb00airs as to\nstrengthen the Union feeling in the border states, and to\ngive utterance to no sentiment and to do no deed which\nshould drive these states toward the confederacy. He saw\nthat if he could hold these states, there could not be a very\nserious war; for the \ufb01rst condition of success to the rebel\ncause was its general adoption by the border slave states.\nTo hold these states by every means that did not bring\nabsolute disgrace upon the government was his object. He\nmust do nothing that would weaken the hands of Union\nmen. The di\ufb00icult position of these Union men he fully\ncomprehended and considered. Of course, he had a hard\n path to pursue; and it is not strange. that those more hasty\nthan himself should sometimes think he was loitering by\nthe way, or was making it more tortuous than was either\nnecessary or expedient. It is doubtful whether the\npoliticians of New England ever gave Mr. Lincoln the credit\nwhich was his due for retaining in the Union those slave\nstates which never left their allegiance. An early and\ndecided war policy could have been morally certain to drive\nevery slave state into the confederacy, except Maryland and\nDelaware, and they would only have been retained by force.\nThe confederacy found that it must make progress or die.\nThe rebel Congress passed a measure for the organization\nof an army, on the ninth of March, and on the twelfth two\nconfederate commissioners \u2014 Mr. Forsyth of Alabama and\nMr. Crawford of Georgia \u2014 presented themselves at the\nState Department at Washington for the purpose of making\na treaty with the United States. They knew, of course, that\nthey could not be received o\ufb00icially, and that they ought to\nbe arrested for treason. The President would not recognize\nthem, but sent to them a copy of his Inaugural, as the\nembodiment \nof \nthe \nviews \nof \nthe \ngovernment. \nThe\ncommissioners hung about Washington for a month,\nlearning what they could, and in daily communication with\nthe traitors who still haunted the con\ufb01dence of the heads of\nthe government. Mr. Seward\u2019s reply to them, on the eighth\nof April, was delayed at their own request until that time,\nand when it came they probably knew what its contents\nand character would be. In order to give secession a new\nimpetus, they wished, in some way, to throw the\n responsibility of beginning war upon the Washington\nauthorities, and to make it appear that they had exhausted\nall peaceable measures for an adjustment of the di\ufb00iculties.\nIn the meantime, Lieutenant Talbot, on behalf of Mr.\nLincoln, was having interviews with Governor Pickens of\nSouth Carolina and with General Beauregard, in command\nof the confederate forces there, in which he informed them\nthat provisions would be sent to Fort Sumter peaceably if\npossible, otherwise by force. This was communicated to L.P.\nWalker, then rebel Secretary of War. Before Talbot had\nmade his communication, Beauregard had informed Major\nAnderson, in command of Fort Sumter, that he must have\nno further intercourse with Charleston; and Talbot himself\nwas refused permission to visit that gallant and faithful\no\ufb00icer.\nThese were very dark days with Mr. Lincoln. The rebels\nwere determined to wrest from him a pretext for war \u2014\ndetermined to make him take a step which could be made\nto appear to be the \ufb01rst step. At the same time, he was\nmaking rapid preparations for war, all of which must be\nkept secret from friends, that they might not exasperate\nfoes. The loyal press became impatient with his apparent\ninactivity, and under the inspiration of this press the loyal\nmasses became uneasy. Under these circumstances, there\nwere not wanting disloyal men in the North, who became\nbold in the entertainment of schemes for a revolution. Mr.\nDouglas himself did not support the administration,\nalthough he had publicly declared for coercion. He could\nnot forget his hatred of the republican party; and was ready\n for almost any scheme for its destruction. He wished to\norganize a great compromise party, which would consent to\nthe reconstruction of the Union, with slavery recognized\nand protected in all its departments. Until the \ufb01rst overt\nact of war had been committed, he brought no aid to the\ngovernment.\nWhile Mr. Lincoln\u2019s friends were clamoring for a policy \u2014\nas if he had not a very decided one \u2014 and his foes north\nand south were busy with their schemes for the destruction\nof himself, his party and his country, he was performing the\nmost exhausting labors. He was thronged with o\ufb00ice-\nseekers, to whose claims he gave his personal attention. He\nwas holding protracted cabinet meetings. He was in almost\nhourly intercourse with prominent men from every section\nof the country. All these labors he was performing with the\nconsciousness that his nominal friends were doubtful, that\nseven states were in open revolt, and that a majority\nthroughout the Union had not the slightest sympathy with\nhim.\nThere was distraction, also, in his counsels. Loyal men,\nburning with patriotic indignation, were demanding that\nFort Sumter should be reinforced and provisioned, while\nthe \nveteran \nLieutenant \nGeneral \nwas \nadvising \nits\nabandonment as a military necessity. The wisdom of Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s waiting became evident at a day not too long\ndelayed. Fort Pickens, which the rebels had not taken, was\nquietly reinforced, and when the vessels which carried the\nrelief were dispatched, Mr. Lincoln gave o\ufb00icial information\nto General Beauregard that provisions were to be sent to\n Major Anderson in Fort Sumter, by an unarmed vessel. He\nwas determined that no hostile act on the part of the\ngovernment should commence the war, for which both\nsides were preparing; although an act of open war had\nalready transpired in Charleston harbor, for which the rebel\nforces were responsible. The steamer Star of the West,\nloaded with troops and provisions for Major Anderson, was\n\ufb01red upon and driven out of the harbor two months before\nthe expiration of Mr. Buchanan\u2019s term of o\ufb00ice. The\nsupplying the garrison with food was an act of humanity,\nand not an act of war, except as it might be so construed.\nBeauregard \nlaid \nthis \nlast \nintelligence \nbefore \nhis\nSecretary of War, and under special instructions, on the\ntwelfth of April, he demanded the surrender of Fort Sumter.\nHe was ready to make the demand, and to back it by force.\nThe city of Charleston was full of troops, and, for months,\nbatteries had been in course of construction, with the\nspecial purpose of compelling the surrender of the fort.\nMajor Anderson had seen these batteries going up, day\nafter day, without the liberty to \ufb01re a gun. He declined to\nsurrender. He was called upon to state when he would\nevacuate the fort. He replied that on the \ufb01fteenth he would\ndo so, should he not meantime receive controlling\ninstructions from the government, or additional supplies.\nThe response which he received was that the confederate\nbatteries would open on Fort Sumter in one hour from the\ndate of the message. The date of the message was \u201cApril\n, , : A.M.\u201d Beauregard was true to his word. At\nhalf past four, the batteries opened upon the fort, which,\n after a long and terrible bombardment, and a gallant\nthough comparatively feeble defense by a small and half-\nstarved garrison, was surrendered the following day.\nThis was practically the initial act of war. Mr. Lincoln, by\nhis determined forbearance, had thrown the onus of its\ncommencement upon the rebel government. Never by\nword, or deed, or declared or concealed intention, had he\nwronged the South, or denied its rights under the\nConstitution. By no hostile act had he provoked war. From\nthe time he had \ufb01rst opened his lips as President of the\nUnited States, he had breathed none but paci\ufb01c words. He\nhad claimed the least that he could claim for the\ngovernment, and still preserve a show of right and power.\nUpon the heads of the conspirators rested every particle of\nresponsibility for the beginning of the war, and the train of\nhorrors that followed. The rebellion was conceived in\nperjury, brought forth in violence, cradled in ignorance, and\nreared upon spoil. It never had an apology for existence\nthat will be entertained for a moment at the bar of history.\nIt never was anything from its birth to its death but a crime\n\u2014 a crime against Christianity, against patriotism, against\nhumanity, against civilization, against progress, against\npersonal and political honor, against the people who were\nforced to support it, against the people who voluntarily put\nit down, and against that God to whom it blasphemously\nappealed for justi\ufb01cation, and arrogantly prayed for\nsuccess.\nThe fall of Sumter was the resurrection of patriotism.\nThe North needed just this. Such a universal burst of\n patriotic indignation as ran over the North under the\nin\ufb02uence of this insult to the national \ufb02ag has never been\nwitnessed. It swept away all party lines as if it had been\n\ufb02ame and they had been \ufb02ax. No combination of moral\nin\ufb02uences could thus have united in one feeling and\npurpose the elements which the \ufb01re from those batteries\nwelded into a burning union. All disloyalty was silenced.\nCompromise was a word that had no signi\ufb01cance.\n\u201cCoercion\u201d \u2014 a word which had had a fearful meaning\namong the timid \u2014 lost its terrors. There was a universal\ndesire, all over the North, to avenge the foul insult. It was\nworth a life-time of indi\ufb00erence or discord to feel and to\nsee a nation thus once more united in thought and purpose,\nand to realize that underneath all divisions of party and\nsect, and deeper down than sel\ufb01sh interest and personal\nprejudice, there was a love of country which made us a\nnation.\nNow was the time for Mr. Lincoln to act. Up to this date\nhe had had no basis for action in the popular feeling. If he\nhad raised an army, that would have been an act of hostility\n\u2014 that would have been a threat of \u201ccoercion.\u201d A thousand\nnorthern presses would have pounced upon him as a\nprovoker of war. On the \ufb01fteenth of April he issued a\nproclamation, calling upon the loyal states for seventy-\ufb01ve\nthousand men to protect the national capital, and suppress\nsuch combinations as had been made to resist the\ninforcement of the laws of the United States. \u201cI appeal,\u201d\nsaid Mr. Lincoln, in this proclamation, \u201cto all loyal citizens\nto favor, facilitate and aid this e\ufb00ort to maintain the honor,\n the integrity and existence of our national Union, and the\nperpetuity of popular government, and to redress the\nwrongs already long enough endured.\u201d The \ufb01rst service, he\nstated, to which the forces thus called for would be\nsubjected would be to repossess the forts, places and\nproperty taken from the Union by the rebels. By the same\nproclamation he convened both Houses of Congress to\nassemble on the fourth of July.\nThe utterance of this proclamation was so clearly a\nnecessity, and was so directly a response to the uprising of\nthe people, that not a voice was raised against it. It was\nreceived with no small degree of excitement, but it was a\nhealthy excitement. It was a necessity; and loyal men\neverywhere felt that the great struggle between slavery\nand the country was upon them. \u201cBetter that it should be\nsettled by us than by our children,\u201d said men, everywhere;\nand in their self-devotion they were encouraged by their\nmothers, sisters and wives. The South knew that war must\ncome, and they were prepared. Nearly all the southern\nforts were already in their hands. They had robbed the\nnorthern arsenals through the miscreant Floyd. They had\ncut o\ufb00 the payment of all debts due the North. They had\nransacked the mails, so that the government could have no\ncommunication with its friends and forces. They had been\ninstructing o\ufb00icers for years, and drilling troops for\nmonths. They knew that there were not arms enough in the\nNorth to furnish an army competent to overcome them.\nWhen, therefore, Mr. Lincoln called for his seventy-\ufb01ve\n thousand men, they met the proclamation with a howl of\nderision.\nMassachusetts was the \ufb01rst state to respond to the call\nfor troops. Governor Andrew, a devoted friend of the\nadministration, acted as promptly then in the support of the\ngovernment as he afterwards labored with e\ufb00icient\npersistence in the destruction of the rebellion; but the\ncredit of having the troops ready for motion and action was\ndue mainly to the foresight of Governor N.P. Banks,\nafterwards a Major General in the federal service. He was\nGovernor Andrew\u2019s predecessor; and three years before the\nbreaking out of the rebellion declared, when rallied on his\ndevotion to the military, that the troops would be called\nupon within a few years to suppress a slaveholders\u2019\nrebellion. The prediction seemed very wild then, and\nprobably would never have been recalled but for its exact\nful\ufb01llment. The troops which he had made ready, Governor\nAndrew, coming after him, promptly dispatched.\nThe moral e\ufb00ect of the marching of the Massachusetts\nSixth was very great. The hearts of the people were stirred\nall along their route by the most powerful emotions. They\nwere fed and applauded at every considerable station.\nWomen thronged around the cars, bringing to them their\nBibles and other gifts, and giving them their tearful\nblessing. New York city was much impressed by their\nsturdy march through the great metropolis. It was a new\nsensation. Men forgot their counting \u2014 rooms and ware-\nhouses, and gave themselves up to the emotions excited by\nso prompt and gallant an exhibition of patriotism. But the\n tramp of the Sixth awoke the young men everywhere to\ndeeds of emulation. Within forty-eight hours after this\nregiment left Boston, two more regiments had been made\nready, and were dispatched. On its way through Baltimore,\nthe Sixth Regiment was attacked by a mob, carrying a\nsecession \ufb02ag, and several of its members killed and\nwounded. This outrage added new fuel to the \ufb01re. The\nNorth was growing angry. The idea that a loyal regiment\ncould not pass through a nominally loyal city, on its way to\nprotect the national capital, without \ufb01ghting its way\nthrough, aroused a storm of indignation that swept over the\nwhole of loyal America.\nGovernor Hicks of Maryland and Mayor Brown of\nBaltimore were frightened. They did not wish to have any\nmore troops taken through Baltimore. Mr. Lincoln assured\nthem that he made no point of bringing troops through that\ncity, and that he left the matter with General Scott, who\nhad said in his presence that the troops might be marched\naround Baltimore. By this arrangement a collision with the\npeople of Baltimore would be avoided, unless they should\ngo out of the way to seek it. \u201cNow and ever,\u201d said Mr.\nLincoln, in closing a note to these gentlemen, \u201cI shall do all\nin my power for peace, consistently with the maintenance\nof the government.\u201d\nGovernor Hicks wished the quarrel between the North\nand South referred to Lord Lyons, the British minister, for\narbitration. To this Mr. Seward, speaking for the President,\nmade a most admirable reply, stating that \u201cwhatever noble\nsentiments, \nonce \nprevalent \nin \nMaryland, \nhad \nbeen\n obliterated, the President would be hopeful, nevertheless,\nthat there is one that would forever remain there and\neverywhere. That sentiment is that no domestic contention\nwhatever, that may arise among the parties of this republic,\nought, in any case, to be referred to any foreign\narbitrament \u2014 least of all to the arbitrament of a foreign\nmonarchy.\u201d\nGovernor Hicks occupied, without doubt, a di\ufb00icult\nposition. Out of ninety-two thousand votes cast at the\npresidential election, only a little more than two thousand\nhad been cast for Mr. Lincoln. More than forty-two\nthousand votes had been given for Mr. Breckinridge, and\nalmost an equal number for John Bell. Maryland was a\nsouthern slave-holding state, and the sympathies of four\npersons in every \ufb01ve were with the rebellion. His people\nthreatened him, while the government would have its\ntroops, and insisted that they should pass through\nMaryland.\nAfter the passage of the Massachusetts Sixth, the mob\nhad control. They burnt the bridges north of Baltimore, so\nas to cut o\ufb00 the means of access to the city; and then,\nagainst the protests of the governor, the troops were\nforwarded by way of Annapolis.\nFour days after Mr. Lincoln\u2019s call for troops \u2014 on the day\nof the bloody passage of the Massachusetts Sixth through\nBaltimore \u2014 he issued a proclamation declaring a blockade\nof the ports of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida,\nMississippi, Louisiana and Texas. This call for troops and\nthe establishment of a blockade were the preliminaries of\n one of the most remarkable wars that have occurred in the\nhistory of the human race \u2014 a war which, for the number of\nmen involved, the amount of spaces traversed, of coast line\nblockaded, of material consumed and results achieved,\nsurpasses all the wars of history.\nThe South had calculated upon the disloyalty of\nMaryland. Nay, more, it had calculated on the assistance of\na large party at the North. It did not intend to be con\ufb01ned\nin its warlike operations to its own territory. Northern\npoliticians, and among them ex-President Pierce, had told\nthem it would not be. It expected to take and hold\nWashington, and to banish the government; and Maryland\nhad an important part to play in the drama. Je\ufb00erson Davis\nhad openly declared that the North and not the South\nshould be the \ufb01eld of battle. The rebel Secretary of War\nsaid publicly in Montgomery that while no man could tell\nwhere the war would end, he would prophesy that the \ufb02ag\nwhich then \ufb02aunted the breeze at Montgomery would \ufb02oat\nover the dome of the old capitol at Washington before the\n\ufb01rst of May; and that it \u201cmight \ufb02oat eventually over Fanueil\nHall itself.\u201d To make good these predictions, the rebel\ngovernment organized and sent toward Virginia, a force of\n, men, calculating upon the secession of Virginia\nwhich had not then joined the confederacy, and which, left\nto the popular choice, never would have taken that fatal\nstep.\nThe attitude of the two governments at this period\npresented a strong contrast \u2014 a most instructive contrast\nto all who are curious to mark the respective degrees of\n responsibility attaching to them for the war which followed.\nThe confederate forces, or the state forces in the\nconfederate interest, had seized and occupied nearly every\nfort, arsenal and dock-yard belonging to the United States,\nupon the southern territory. The rebel government had\nopened its batteries upon United States vessels, and had\nbombarded and captured Fort Sumter. It had issued letters\nof marque to distress our commerce. It was engaged in the\nattempt to force every border slave state into the support\nof its schemes. It was pushing its soldiers northward for a\nwar of aggression; and its highest representatives were\npublicly boasting that their \ufb02ag would soon \ufb02oat over the\ncapitol at Washington, and that the war should not be\ncarried on upon confederate soil. The attitude of the rebel\ngovernment \nwas \nthat \nof \ndirect, \nbitter, \ndetermined,\naggressive hostility.\nVirginia at this time was holding a state convention\nwhich, to the dismay and vexation of the rebel leaders, was\ncontrolled by a large majority of Union men. Nothing is\nmore demonstrable than that the choice of Virginia was to\nremain in the Union. These delegates were chosen as Union\nmen; yet every possible in\ufb02uence was brought to bear upon\nthem to cajole or coerce them into disunion. Threats,\nmisrepresentations, promises of power, social proscription,\nappeals to personal and sectional interest, everything that\ntreasonable ingenuity could suggest were resorted to to\nurge the laggard state into the vortex of secession. The fall\nof Sumter, the inaugural of President Lincoln and the\nfailure of the confederate commissioners to secure a treaty\n were used in di\ufb00erent ways to in\ufb02ame southern pride, and\nloosen the love of the loyal members from the old Union.\nThe President\u2019s Inaugural had been so misconstrued as to\nconvey the idea that his policy was one of coercion; and the\nconvention sent a committee to Mr. Lincoln, commissioned\nto ask him to communicate to the convention the policy\nwhich the federal executive intended to pursue, in regard\nto the confederate states, complaining that great and\ninjurious uncertainty prevailed in the public mind in regard\nto this policy.\nTo this request Mr. Lincoln gave a formal answer; and in\nthis answer appears the contrast to which attention has\nbeen called. He expressed his regret and morti\ufb01cation that,\nafter having stated his position and policy as plainly as he\nwas able to state it in his inaugural address, there should\nbe any uncertainty on the subject. \u201cAs I then and therein\nsaid,\u201d the reply proceeds, \u201c\u2018the power con\ufb01ded in me will\nbe used to hold, occupy and possess property and places\nbelonging to the government, and to collect duties and\nimposts; but, beyond what is necessary for these objects,\nthere will be no invasion, no using of force against, or\namong, people anywhere.\u2019\u201d Fort Sumter, he declared it his\npurpose to repossess, with all the other places seized from\nthe government, and to the best of his ability he should\nrepel force by force. In consequence of the attack on\nSumter, it was possible that he should cause the withdrawal\nof the mails from the states which claimed to have seceded.\nHe closed by reiterating the claim of the government upon\nthe military posts and property which had been seized, and\n by stating that, whatever else he might do for the purpose,\nhe should not \u201cattempt to collect the duties and imposts by\nany armed invasion of any part of the country,\u201d not\nmeaning by that, however, to cut himself o\ufb00 from the\nliberty to land a force necessary to relieve a fort upon the\nborder of the country.\nOn one side was rampant treason and a policy of\naggressive war; on the other, patient forbearance, and the\nmost considerate care not to take any step not absolutely\nnecessary to the maintenance of the indisputable rights of\nthe government. No man in the United States who\npretended to be loyal could \ufb01nd fault with Mr. Lincoln for\nclaiming too much, or being harsh with those \u201cerring\nsisters\u201d who, it was believed by many, might be gently led\nback to their allegiance.\nOn the seventeenth of April, Virginia went out of the\nUnion by a convention vote of eighty-eight to \ufb01fty-\ufb01ve; and\non the twenty-\ufb01rst of May the confederate capital was\ntransferred \nto \nRichmond. \nThenceforth \nVirginia \nwent\nstraight toward desolation. Its \u201csacred soil\u201d was from that\nhour devoted to trenches, forti\ufb01cations, battle-\ufb01elds,\nmilitary roads, camps and graves.\nThe conciliatory policy of Mr. Lincoln had threatened the\nruin of the confederacy; but the confederacy made war, and\nthen appealed to the border states for sympathy and help.\nGovernor Pickens of South Carolina telegraphed the fall of\nSumter to the Governor of Virginia, and appealed to\nVirginia to know what she was going to do. This was the\npolicy \u2014 to precipitate war, and then appeal to sectional\n pride and interest for sectional assistance. The \ufb01rst\npractical show of sectional feeling on the part of the border\nstates was contained in the angry and insulting responses\nwhich they returned to Mr. Lincoln\u2019s call for troops. These\nresponses exhibited the sympathies of their Governors, at\nleast. Tennessee, North Carolina and Arkansas followed\nVirginia out of the Union, and thus the confederate cause\nmade the gain it sought.\nAt the North and West the response to the President\u2019s\ncall for soldiers was rendered with enthusiastic alacrity, the\nstates vieing with each other in the o\ufb00ice of raising, \ufb01tting\nout and dispatching troops. Money was o\ufb00ered to the\ngovernment by millions, and the President found that he\nhad a basis for a policy in the national feeling. After a week\nof great anxiety, Washington was relieved; and while troops\nfrom the North were rushing southward, a still larger\nnumber from the South were pushing northward in\npreparation for the grand struggle.\nOne of the most encouraging incidents of this opening\nchapter of the war was a visit of Mr. Douglas to Mr. Lincoln,\nin which the former gave to the latter the assurance of his\nsympathy and support in the war for the preservation of the\nUnion. It is to be remembered that Mr. Douglas was an\nambitious man, that he was a strong party man, that he had\nbattled for power with all the persistence of a strong and\ndetermined nature, and that he was a sadly disappointed\nman. The person with whom he had had his hardest \ufb01ghts\noccupied the chair to which he had for many years aspired.\n On Sunday, the fourteenth of April, all Washington was\nalive with excitement under the e\ufb00ect of the news of the\nfall of Sumter. Secessionists could not conceal their joy, and\nthe loyal were equally sad and indignant. Churches were\nforsaken, and the opening of the war was the only topic of\nthought and conversation. Under these circumstances,\nHon. \nGeorge \nAshmun \nof \nMassachusetts, \nwho \nwas\npersonally on the most friendly terms with Mr. Lincoln and.\nMr. Douglas, called on the latter in the evening, to obtain\nfrom him some public declaration that should help the\ngovernment in its extremity. He found the Senator\nsurrounded by political friends, who were soon dismissed,\nand then, for an hour, the two men discussed the relations\nof Mr. Douglas to the administration. The \ufb01rst impulse of\nthe Senator was against Mr. Ashmun\u2019s wishes, who desired\nhim to go to the President at once, and tell him he would\nsustain him in all the needful measures which the exigency\ndemanded. His reply was: \u201cMr. Lincoln has dealt hardly\nwith me, in removing some of my friends from o\ufb00ice, and I\ndon\u2019t know as he wants my advice or aid.\u201d Mr. Ashmun\nremarked that he had probably followed democratic\nprecedents in making removals, but that the present\nquestion was above party, and that it was now in the power\nof Mr. Douglas to render such a service to his country as\nwould not only give him a title to its lasting gratitude, but\nwould show that in the hour of his country\u2019s need he could\ntrample all party considerations and resentments under\nfeet. At this juncture, Mrs. Douglas came in, and gave the\nwhole weight of her a\ufb00ectionate in\ufb02uence in the direction\n in which Mr. Ashmun was endeavoring to lead him. He\ncould not withstand the in\ufb02uence of his friend, his wife, and\nthat better nature to which they appealed. He gave up all\nhis enmity, all his resentment, cast every unworthy\nsentiment and sel\ufb01sh feeling behind him, and cordially\ndeclared his willingness to go to Mr. Lincoln, and o\ufb00er him\nhis earnest and hearty support.\nIt was nearly dark when the two gentlemen started for\nthe President\u2019s house. Mr. Lincoln was alone, and on\nlearning their errand gave them a most cordial welcome.\nFor once, the life-long antagonists were united in heart and\npurpose. Mr. Lincoln took up the proclamation, calling for\nseventy-\ufb01ve thousand troops, which he had determined to\nissue the next day, and read it. When he had \ufb01nished, Mr.\nDouglas rose from his chair and said: \u201cMr. President, I\ncordially concur in every word of that document, except\nthat instead of the call for seventy-\ufb01ve thousand men I\nwould make it two hundred thousand. You do not know the\ndishonest purposes of those men as well as I do.\u201d Then he\nasked the President and Mr. Ashmun to look at a map of the\nUnited States which hung at one end of the room. On this\nhe pointed out, in detail, the principal strategic points\nwhich should be at once strengthened for the coming\ncontest. Among the more prominent of these were Fortress\nMonroe, Washington, Harper\u2019s Ferry and Cairo. He then\nenlarged upon the \ufb01rm, warlike course which should be\npursued, while Mr. Lincoln listened with earnest interest,\nand the two old foes parted that night thorough friends,\nperfectly united in a patriotic purpose.\n After leaving the President, Mr. Ashmun said to Mr.\nDouglas: \u201cYou have done justice to your own reputation and\nto the President; and the country must know it. The\nproclamation will go by telegraph all over the country in\nthe morning, and the account of this interview must go with\nit. I shall send it, either in my own language or yours. I\nprefer that you should give your own version.\u201d Mr. Douglas\nsaid he would write it; and so the dispatch went with the\nmessage wherever the telegraph would carry it, con\ufb01rming\nthe wavering of his own party, and helping to raise the tide\nof loyal feeling, among all parties and classes, to its \ufb02ood.\nThe dispatch, the original of which Mr. Ashmun still retains,\nwas as follows:\n\u201cMr. Douglas called on the President this evening, and\nhad an interesting conversation on the present condition of\nthe country. The substance of the conversation was that\nwhile Mr. Douglas was unalterably opposed to the\nadministration on all its political issues, he was prepared to\nsustain the President in the exercise of all his constitutional\nfunctions to preserve the Union, and maintain the\ngovernment and defend the federal capital. A \ufb01rm policy\nand prompt action were necessary. The capital of our\ncountry was in danger and must be defended at all hazards,\nand at any expense of men or money. He spoke of the\npresent and future without reference to the past.\u201d\nThe writer of the life of Mr. Lincoln and the chronicler of\nthe rebellion will \ufb01nd few more delightful tasks than that of\nrecording the unwearied devotion of Mr. Douglas to the\ncause of his country during the brief remainder of his life.\n He was done with his dreams of power, done with the\nthought that compromise would save the country, and done,\nfor \nthe \ntime \nat \nleast, \nwith \nschemes \nfor \nparty\naggrandizement. Six days after his interview with Mr.\nLincoln he was on his way home, and at Bellair, Ohio, he\nwas called out to make a speech. All parties received him\nwith the greatest enthusiasm, and every word he uttered\nhad the genuine ring of patriotism. Subsequently he\naddressed the legislature of Illinois, at Spring\ufb01eld, and his\nown fellow-citizens at Chicago. The old party talk and the\nold party policy were all forgotten, and only the sturdy,\nenthusiastic patriot spoke. In one of the last letters he ever\nwrote he said: \u201cWe should never forget that a man cannot\nbe a true democrat unless he is a loyal patriot.\u201d In May he\nbecame sick, and on the third of June he died. In the low\ndelirium that attended his disease he talked of nothing but\nhis country, and almost his last coherent words were\nshaped to a wish for its honor and prosperity, through the\ndefeat and dispersion of its enemies.\nMr. Lincoln felt his death as a calamity. He had been of\ngreat service to him in unveiling the designs of the rebels,\nand in bringing to the support of the government an\nelement which a word from him at a favorable moment\nwould have alienated. He freely said that he regarded Mr.\nDouglas as one of his best and most valuable friends.\nTo \nthose \nwho \nare \ncurious \nin \nmarking \nstrange\ncoincidences, it will be interesting to remember that just\nfour years to an hour after Mr. Douglas parted with Mr.\nLincoln, at the close of the interview that has been\n described, Mr. Lincoln was slain by an assassin. Both died\nwith a common purpose uppermost in their minds, one in\nthe threatening morning of the rebellion, and the other\nwhen its sun had just set in blood; and both sleep in the\ndust of that magni\ufb01cent state almost every rod of which,\nwithin a quarter of a century, had echoed to their\ncontending voices as they expounded their principles to the\npeople.\n   ha ter  I .\nTHE EMERGENCY WHICH the rebellion forced upon the\ngovernment found that government no less prepared to\nmeet it than it found the loyal people of the country\nwanting in military knowledge and experience. The people\nwere so eager to furnish men and supplies that they at once\nbecame impatient for results. No one among them seemed\nto doubt that the rebellion might be crushed in a few\nmonths, at most. They did not comprehend the almost\nin\ufb01nite detail of a war. Patience was a virtue which it took\nfour years to teach them; and when every man connected\nwith the government was making all the e\ufb00orts possible to\nforward the preparations for the struggle, the popular\npress \u2014 meaning well, but much misapprehending the\ndi\ufb00iculties of the situation \u2014 were already \ufb01nding fault\nwith the tardiness of operations. They had apparently\nforgotten how long it took to bring the Mexican war to a\nsuccessful termination; \u2014 indeed, they stood in a very\ndi\ufb00erent relation to this war from that which they had held\ntoward the Mexican war. That was a war of the government\nagainst another power; this was a war of their own, against\ndomestic traitors who sought to overthrow the government.\nEvery loyal man had a direct interest in the war; and he\njudged every movement and every delay as if it were his\nown private enterprise. There were inconveniences in this;\n but, in this universal personal interest, lay the secret of\nthose four years of popular devotion to the war which so\nastonished the observers of other lands, and made ultimate\nvictory, under Providence, a certainty from the \ufb01rst.\nThis popular impatience was, during the \ufb01rst two or\nthree years of the war, one of the serious di\ufb00iculties with\nwhich the administration had to deal. It had its advantages\nin holding to vigilance and industry all who were in\nresponsible \npositions, \nbut \nit \nhad \ndisadvantages \nin\nsometimes compelling precipitancy of action, and in\nbreeding in the administration the idea that the people\nwere to be managed like children whose food should be\ncarefully prepared in the departments whenever it was\nadministered, or carefully withheld when their stomachs\nwere not able to receive it. This idea of the people was not\nborn in the White House. Mr. Lincoln had a profound\nrespect for the people, and never had any sympathy with\ne\ufb00orts which aimed to make them instruments in the hands\nof the government, or which ignored the fact that they\nwere the source of all his power.\nDuring the latter part of April, certain important military\noperations were e\ufb00ected. Washington, the safety of which\nwas the \ufb01rst consideration, was relieved from immediate\ndanger; Fortress Monroe, commanding the water gateway\nof Virginia, was reinforced and held; the government works\nat Harper\u2019s Ferry were blown up and burned by Lieutenant\nJones, in command of a company of regulars, moved by the\nintelligence of an advance of a large confederate force;\nCairo, Illinois, an important strategic point at the\n con\ufb02uence of the Ohio and the Mississippi rivers, had been\noccupied by government forces, and the blockade was\nextended so as to embrace the states of Virginia and North\nCarolina. Then began organization. On the twenty-seventh\nof April, Adjutant General Thomas made the following\nannouncement of new military departments: First, The\nmilitary department of Washington, including the District of\nColumbia, \naccording \nto \nits \noriginal \nboundary, \nFort\nWashington and the adjacent country, and the state of\nMaryland as far as Bladensburgh, to be under the charge of\nColonel Mans\ufb01eld, with head-quarters at Washington.\nSecond, The department of Annapolis, head-quarters at\nthat city, and including the country for twenty miles on\neither side of the railroad between Annapolis and\nWashington, under command of General B.F. Butler, of the\nMassachusetts volunteers. Third, The department of\nPennsylvania, including that state, Delaware and all of\nMaryland not included in the other departments already\nmentioned, and with Major General Patterson in command.\nThe extension of the department of Washington to the old\nlimits of the district was for the purpose of including\nterritory absolutely necessary for the defense of the capital.\nOn the following tenth of May, another department was\nadded to this list, including the states of Ohio, Indiana and\nIllinois, under the charge of General George B. McClellan.\nThe object of this department was to maintain a defensive\nline on the Ohio River from Wheeling to Cairo.\nOn the twenty-ninth of April, Je\ufb00erson Davis convened\nhis Congress at Montgomery, and sent them a message\n which was intended to be a justi\ufb01cation of himself and his\ncause, before the country and the world. It was a document\nof rare ability, in its plausible presentation of the favorite\nsouthern doctrine of state rights, and its rehearsal of the\npretended wrongs which the South had su\ufb00ered at the\nhands of the North. It must have made a profound\nimpression upon the great multitude of minds ready to\nreceive it among his own people, and upon statesmen\nabroad who, from the \ufb01rst opening of the American\ndi\ufb00iculties, manifested a strange ignorance of the genius\nand structure of American institutions.\nIt is interesting to notice here the attempt on the part,\nboth of Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Davis, to argue the rightfulness\nof their respective positions, in a great number of their\nstate papers. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s old intellectual struggle with Mr.\nDouglas had ceased, and Je\ufb00erson Davis was now his\nantagonist \u2014 a man of higher culture and deeper character.\nMr. Davis, in his message, assumed the role of the\nwronged party. Notwithstanding the fact that he had seized\nall the property of the United States upon which he could\nlay his hands, and had, by bombardment, compelled the\nsurrender of Fort Sumter, he tried to shift the burden of\nopening the war upon Mr. Lincoln, whose cal for troops,\nweeks after a confederate army was on its feet and actively\ngathering numbers, was the pretended cause of the\nconvening of the rebel Congress. In this very message,\nindeed, he announced that there were already nineteen\nthousand men in di\ufb00erent forts, and that sixteen thousand\nwere on their way to Virginia.\n In the doctrine of state rights was the only justi\ufb01cation of\nthe rebellion; and it was necessary that Mr. Davis should\nlabor to establish it. With him, a state was greater than the\nUnited States. The state was sovereign, and the Union was\nessentially subject. Whenever, therefore, any state should\nhave a plausible pretext for dissolVing its union with other\nstates, it had a right to do so. Mr. Davis did not stop to\nconsider that he could not establish a government on any\nsuch basis as this, and that the doctrine of state rights\nwould, in the end, be just as fatal to his confederacy as he\nwas endeavoring to make it to the United States. On the\nother hand, Mr. Lincoln held the Union sovereign and the\nstate subject. A state had no right to coerce a nation into\ndissolution, any more than a county had a right to force a\nstate into dissolution. He maintained that the United States\nwere a nation, one and indivisible, and that any attempt to\ndissolve it on the part of a state, or a combination of states,\nwas treason. Here was where the Union and the new\nconfederacy separated. The confederacy was a logical\nresult of the doctrine of state rights, and its destruction, by\nall the power of the federal government, was the logical\nnecessity of its contravention. Mr. Lincoln believed that a\nnation had a fundamental right to live, and that the United\nStates were a nation. Mr. Davis believed that the United\nStates were not a nation \u2014 or, if one \u2014 that it held its only\nright to live at the will of any state that might choose to\nexercise it.\nOn the third of May, Mr. Lincoln found it necessary to call\nfor forty-two thousand additional volunteers, to serve for\n three years, unless sooner discharged, and for an\naggregate of twenty-two thousand seven hundred and\nfourteen men for di\ufb00erent classes of service in the regular\narmy. An additional call for eighteen thousand men to serve\nin the navy was also made in the same proclamation. The\ncountry gave quick response to this call, and the demand\nfor army volunteers was soon answered to excess.\nThe \narea \nof \noperations \nwas \nrapidly \nspreading.\nSecessionists in and around St. Louis, Missouri, were\nplotting for the seizure of the arsenal in that city, but\nCaptain (afterward General) Lyon promptly thwarted the\nscheme, and secured the arms for the government forces. A\nsecession camp, forming in the same city, was captured,\nand many within it taken prisoners. The Governor of\nMissouri was disloyal, and did what he could to throw that\nstate into the hands of the rebels; and General Harney, for\na short time in command of the military department of the\nWest, so far aided his schemes as to agree with Sterling\nPrice that the whole duty of maintaining order in the state\nshould be intrusted to the state authorities. Harney was\nremoved, and General Lyon put in his place, with a force\nfor which he found abundant employment, and at the head\nof which he afterwards fell \u2014 one of the \ufb01rst and costliest\nsacri\ufb01ces of the war.\nDuring all the \ufb01rst part of May, a secession \ufb02ag \ufb02oated\nover a building in Alexandria, in sight of the capitol at\nWashington; the rebel forces were gathering at Manassas\nJunction, and rebel troops held Harper\u2019s Ferry. On the\ntwenty-second of May, General Butler took command of the\n new department of the South, with head-quarters at\nFortress Monroe. Five days afterward, he issued his famous\norder declaring slaves \u201ccontraband of war.\u201d The phrase\nimbodied a new idea, which was the germ of a new policy,\nas well as the basis of a new name for the freed negro.\nGeneral Butler had under command here about twelve\nthousand men. Confederate troops were already gathering\nand fortifying in the vicinity, and on the tenth of June\noccurred the \ufb01rst considerable battle of the war at Big\nBethel. It was a badly managed a\ufb00air on the part of the\nUnion forces; and, in the excited and expectant state of the\npublic mind, produced a degree of discouragement in the\ncountry quite disproportioned to the importance of its\nresults. Here fell Major Winthrop, a young man of great\nbravery and rare literary ability. The troops fought well, but\nwere badly handled. Enough was learned, however, of the\nbravery of the Yankee, to give prophecy of \ufb01ne results when\nthe art of war should be better learned.\nThese \ncomparatively \nsmall \nand \nwidely \nseparated\nmovements were but ripples shot out into the coves and\nreaches of treason from the tidal sweep of the loyal armies,\ncrowding southward to dash against the grand front of the\nrebellion. The government had no lack of men; but it\nsu\ufb00ered sadly for the want of arms to put into their hands.\nBut they were armed in one way and another \u2014 some of\nthem very poorly. The impatient people could not know how\npoorly, because it would expose the weakness of the\ngovernment to the enemy; so they clamored for a\nmovement, and it was made. On the twenty-fourth of May,\n General Mans\ufb01eld began his passage into Virginia. The\ngallant and lamented Colonel Ellsworth was sent with his\nregiment of Zouaves to Alexandria; and troops to the\nnumber of thirteen thousand were moved across the river,\nand set to work in the erection of forts for the defense of\nWashington. Colonel Ellsworth, on landing at Alexandria,\nwithout resistance, went personally to the Marshall House,\nkept by James Jackson, and mounting to the top, pulled\ndown the secession \ufb02ag with which Jackson had for weeks\nbeen \ninsulting \nthe \nauthorities \nat \nWashington. \nOn\ndescending, the owner shot him dead, and was in turn\nimmediately shot dead by a private named Brownell, who\naccompanied his Colonel.\nIt is interesting to remember the profound impression\nwhich the death of this young and enthusiastic o\ufb00icer\nproduced upon the country. He was among the \ufb01rst the\nnation gave to the war, and his name, with those of Greble\nand Winthrop, who fell at Big Bethel, and Lyon who\nafterward fell in Missouri were embalmed in the fresh\nsensibilities of the people, and remain there, \ufb01xed and\nfragrant, while thousands of those since fallen have found\nonly weary and sickened hearts to rest in, or memories too\nsadly crowded with precious names to give them room.\nEllsworth\u2019s death a\ufb00ected Mr. Lincoln with peculiar sorrow.\nHe had known the young man well. At one time, Ellsworth\nwas a student in Lincoln \n Herndon\u2019s o\ufb00ice; and he\naccompanied Mr. Lincoln on his journey to Washington. The\nbody of the young martyr was borne sadly back to\nWashington, and was received into the White House itself,\n where the funeral took place, Mr. Lincoln himself assuming\nthe position of chief mourner.\nAfter the accumulation of a large army on the Virginia\nside of the Potomac, it was determined to push forward the\nforces then under the command of Major General\nMcDowell, for a battle with the rebel army which had been\ngathered at Manassas. For this battle each side had been\npreparing with great industry. The enemy had withdrawn\nhis forces from the occupation of Harper\u2019s Ferry, and that\nimportant point had passed into federal control. From every\nquarter he gathered in his troops, or held them within easy\ncall, and waited for the attack. It began on the nineteenth,\nand ended on the twenty-\ufb01rst of July, in a most terrible rout\nof the Union forces. The whole army upon which the\nPresident and the people had rested such strong hope and\nexpectation was broken in pieces, and came \ufb02ying back\ntoward Washington, Panic-stricken, worn out, disorganized\nand utterly demoralized. They had fought bravely and well;\nbut they were not above in\ufb02uences that have a\ufb00ected\narmies since time began, and they yielded to fears which\nmade them uncontrollable.\nThe loss of this battle, fought under the pressure of\npopular impatience, cost the country a fearful amount of\nsacri\ufb01ce. \nIt \ngreatly \nencouraged \nthe \nrebels, \ntheir\nsympathizers abroad sent up a shout of triumph, and the\nloyal masses were put to such a test of their patriotism and\ndetermined bravery as they had never been subjected to.\nThe work had all to be done again, under the most\ndiscouraging circumstances; but when the case was\n reviewed, reason was found for gratitude that it had been\nno worse. Washington, at the close of the battle at Bull Run,\nwas at the mercy of the rebels. It was well that they did not\nknow this, or that, if they knew it, they were not in a\ncondition to push on, and occupy what must have fallen\ninto their hands.\nAmong all the millions to whom this event brought\nsorrow, there was not one who su\ufb00ered so keenly as the\ntender-hearted and patient man who, walking back and\nforth between the White House and the War Department,\nfelt the great burden of it all upon his own shoulders. He\nhad need of the full exercise of his abounding faith in\nProvidence to sustain him in that dark and perilous hour.\nHe could not but feel that peace had been put far away by\nthe result of the battle; but he learned afterwards that\nProvidence had wise and bene\ufb01cent designs in that result.\nPeace conquered then, would have been peace with the\ncause of the war retained. Peace then would have left four\nmillion slaves in bondage. Peace then would have left the\n\u201chouse divided against itself\u201d still, with the possibility of an\ninde\ufb01nite extension of slavery. It was not so to be. A\nthousand plagues were yet to come before the public mind\nwould be ready to let the bondman go.\nSoon after the original movement into Virginia, the\nPostmaster-general suspended all postal service in the\nseceded states; and at this time active movements\ncommenced in General McClellan\u2019s department. Under the\nauspices of Governor Mago\ufb00in of Kentucky \u2014 one of the\ngovernors who had sent back an insulting response to the\n President\u2019s original call for troops \u2014 his Inspector-general\nBuckner organized a force in Kentucky, which was watched\nwith much anxiety by the loyal people on the other side of\nthe Ohio, because it was believed to be intended for the\nrebel service. Buckner visited General McClellan at\nCincinnati on the eighth of June, and on the twenty-second\nof that month he reported to Governor Mago\ufb00in the terms\nof a convention into which he had entered with the federal\ngeneral. Brie\ufb02y he reported that General McClellan\nstipulated that Kentucky should be regarded by the United\nStates as neutral territory, even though southern troops\nshould occupy it. In such a case, the United States should\ncall upon Kentucky to remove such troops, and if she\nshould fail to do so within a reasonable time, then the\nGeneral claimed the same right of occupation accorded to\nthe southern troops, and promised to withdraw so soon as\nthose troops should be expelled. Whether this was a true\nstatement of the agreement or not, General McClellan did\nnothing inconsistent with it, although he afterwards denied\nBuckner\u2019s statement of the results of the consultation. The\noccupation and defense of important points upon the bank\nof the river opposite Cincinnati were abandoned, and, in a\nletter to Mr. Crittenden, he disclaimed all responsibility for\nthe intrusion of a body of General Prentiss\u2019 men, who had\nlanded on the Kentucky shore and brought away a\nsecession \ufb02ag. The General, it was evident, did not\ncomprehend the character of the rebellion, or he failed to\nrecognize the fact that in such a struggle there could be no\n such \nthing \nas \nthe \nneutrality \nwhich \nKentucky \nwas\nprofessedly desirous to maintain.\nThe tenderness of the government, as well as of the\ngenerals it had appointed, toward slavery, is worthy of note\nat this juncture. Mr. Lincoln had always taken great pains\nto show that he respected the legal rights of slavery under\nthe Constitution. The republicans, in national convention\nand in Congress, had done the same. The three democratic\ngenerals it had placed in command \u2014 Butler, Patterson and\nMcClellan \u2014 went a step further, and promised in advance\nthat they would not only not interfere with slavery, but\nwould \nassist \nthe \nrebels \nin \nputting \ndown \na \nslave\ninsurrection. General Butler, of the three, experienced a\nhealthy reaction from this devotion to slavery at an early\nday.\nWestern Virginia was loyal, and, on the seventeenth of\nJune, in convention at Wheeling, repudiated the ordinance\nof secession passed by the state convention, and promptly\ninaugurated a new state government, with Francis H.\nPierpoint for Governor. This was the \ufb01rst step toward\n\u201creconstruction,\u201d and it was taken under the direct\nsanction of Mr. Lincoln. The doctrine of secession thus\nearly returned to plague the inventors. Rebel forces and\nrebel sympathizers were of course in Western Virginia; and\na campaign was inaugurated there, early in June, for the\nexpulsion of these forces from the territory. General\nRosecrans and General Thomas A. Morris had this\ncampaign in hand, and, on the twenty-third of June,\nGeneral McClellan arrived. On the tenth of July, a skirmish\n was had with the rebels at Laurel Hill, and two days later\nthe battle of Rich Mountain was fought, which resulted in\nthe defeat and surrender of the rebel Colonel Pegram, with\na thousand men. This did not compass the successes of the\nday. General Garnett who was bringing supports to General\nPegram was pursued, his forces routed, and himself killed.\nThis temporarily cleaned out the enemy from Western\nVirginia. \nGeneral \nMcClellan\u2019s \ndispatch \nto \nthe \nwar\ndepartment announcing this very grateful victory was\ndirect, spirited and well written, and immediately attracted\nthe attention of the country. These successes in Western\nVirginia, together with the Napoleonic manner of their\nannouncement, paved the way to that wonderful popular\ncon\ufb01dence \nwhich \nwas \nafterward \naccorded \nto \nthe\ncommanding general, although he had very little to do in\nplanning the campaign in which they were won, or the\nbattles by which they were secured.\nCongress, \naccording \nto \nthe \nproclamation \nof \nthe\nPresident, had assembled on the fourth of July, and was of\ncourse in session when the successes in Western Virginia\nwere achieved, as well as when the rout of the army at Bull\nRun occurred. Indeed, the presence of the members at\nWashington added to the pressure which precipitated the\nmovement that resulted so disastrously. Some of the\nmembers went out to see the \ufb01ght. One of these was taken\nprisoner, and others took such a lesson in retreating as to\ncure them of all curiosity concerning battles and battle-\n\ufb01elds forever.\n On \nthe \nmeeting \nof \nCongress, \nthe \nPresident\ncommunicated a message which was received with\nprofound interest, both by Congress and the whole country.\nThe opening portions of the document were strictly\nhistorical of the events of the rebellion up to the date of its\nutterance; and as the most of these events have already\nfound record in these pages, their reproduction is not\nnecessary.\nBy opening \ufb01re upon Sumter, when it had not \u201ca gun in\nsight, or in expectancy, to return their \ufb01re, save only the\nfew in the fort sent to that harbor years before for their\nown protection,\u201d he declared that the rebels had forced\nupon the country the distinct issue \u2014 immediate dissolution\nor blood. \u201cAnd this issue,\u201d the message proceeds,\n\u201cembraces more than the fate of these United States. It\npresents to the whole family of man the question whether a\nconstitutional republic or democracy \u2014 a government of\nthe people by the same people \u2014 can or cannot maintain its\nterritorial integrity, against its own domestic foes. It\npresents the question whether discontented individuals, too\nfew in numbers to control administration according to\norganic law in any case, can always, upon the pretences\nmade in this case, or on any other pretences, or arbitrarily,\nwithout any pretence, break up their government, and thus\npractically put an end to free government upon the earth. It\nforces us to ask, \u2018Is there in all republics, this inherent and\nfatal weakness?\u2019 \u2018Must a government, of necessity, be too\nstrong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to\nmaintain its own existence?\u2019\u201d\n The attempt of some of the border states to maintain a\nsort of armed neutrality \u2014 as illustrated in the case of\nKentucky \u2014 the arming of those states to keep the forces\non either side from passing over their territory \u2014 he\ndeclared would be disunion completed, if for a moment\nentertained. It would be building \u201can impassable wall along\nthe line of separation, and yet, not quite an impassable one,\nfor, under the guise of neutrality, it would tie the hands of\nUnion men, and freely pass supplies from among them to\nthe insurrectionists, which it could not do as an open\nenemy. At a stroke it would take all the trouble o\ufb00 the\nhands of secession, except only what proceeds from the\nexternal blockade.\u201d\nSoon after the \ufb01rst call for militia, liberty was given to\nthe commanding general to suspend the privilege of the\nwrit of habeas corpus in certain cases, or \u201cto arrest and\ndetain without resort to the ordinary processes of law such\nindividuals as he might deem dangerous to the public\nsafety.\u201d Although this liberty was indulged very sparingly,\nthere \nwere \nnot \nwanting \nmen \nunfriendly \nto \nthe\nadministration who made it the subject of factious\ncomplaint. This fact Mr. Lincoln noticed, and this was his\ndefense:\n\u201cThe whole of the laws which were required to be\nfaithfully executed were being resisted, and failing of\nexecution, in nearly one-third of the states. Must they be\nallowed to \ufb01nally fail of execution, even had it been\nperfectly clear that by the use of the means necessary to\ntheir execution some single law, made in such extreme\n tenderness of the citizen\u2019s liberty, that, practically, it\nrelieves more of the guilty than the innocent, should, to a\nvery limited extent, be violated? To state the question more\ndirectly: are all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the\ngovernment itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?\nEven in such a case, would not the o\ufb00icial oath be broken,\nif the government should be overthrown when it was\nbelieved that disregarding the single law would tend to\npreserve it? But it was not believed that this question was\npresented. It was not believed that any law was violated.\nThe provision of the Constitution that \u2018the privilege of the\nwrit of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless, when\nin cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may\nrequire it,\u2019 is equivalent to a provision \u2014 is a provision \u2014\nthat such privilege may be suspended when, in case of\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety does require it. It\nwas decided that we have a case of rebellion, and that the\npublic safety does require the quali\ufb01ed suspension of the\nprivilege of the writ, which was authorized to be made.\nNow it is insisted that Congress, and not the Executive, is\ninvested with this power. But the Constitution itself is silent\nas to which or who is to exercise this power; and as the\nprovision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it\ncannot be believed the framers of the instrument intended\nthat, in every case, the danger should run its course until\nCongress could be called together, the very assembling of\nwhich might be prevented, as was intended in this case by\nthe rebellion.\u201d\n After recommending that Congress make the contest a\nshort and decisive one, by placing at the control of the\ngovernment four hundred thousand men and four hundred\nmillion dollars, and stating that a right result at that time\nwould be worth more to the world than ten times the men\nand ten times the money, Mr. Lincoln took up the doctrine\nof state rights, state sovereignty, the right of secession,\nc., and argued against it at length, doubtless as a reply to\nthe message of Mr. Davis, and to place before the world,\nwhose governments and people were sitting in judgment on\nthe case, the grounds of the national struggle with the\nrebellion. The passage is too important to be abbreviated:\n\u201cIt might seem, at \ufb01rst thought, to be of little di\ufb00erence\nwhether the present movement at the South be called\n\u201csecession,\u201d or \u201crebellion.\u201d The movers, however, will\nunderstand the di\ufb00erence. At the beginning, they knew\nthey could never raise their treason to any respectable\nmagnitude by any name which implies violation of law. They\nknew their people possessed as much of moral sense, as\nmuch of devotion to law and order, and as much pride in,\nand reverence for the history and government of their\ncommon country, as any other civilized and patriotic\npeople. They knew they could make no advancement\ndirectly in the teeth of these strong and noble sentiments.\nAccordingly, they commenced by an insidious debauching\nof the public mind. They invented an ingenious sophism,\nwhich, if conceded, was followed by perfectly logical steps,\nthrough all the incidents, to the complete destruction of the\nUnion. The sophism itself is, that any state of the Union\n may, consistently with the national Constitution, and\ntherefore lawfully and peacefully, withdraw from the Union\nwithout the consent of the Union, or of any other state. The\nlittle disguise that the supposed right is to be exercised\nonly for just cause, themselves to be the sole judges of its\njustice, is too thin to merit any notice.\n\u201cWith rebellion thus sugar-coated they have been\ndrugging the public mind of their section for more than\nthirty years, and until at length they have brought many\ngood men to a willingness to take up arms against the\ngovernment the day after some assemblage of men have\nenacted the farcical pretence of taking their state out of the\nUnion, who could haye been brought to no such thing the\nday before.\n\u201cThis sophism derives much, perhaps the whole, of its\ncurrency \nfrom \nthe \nassumption \nthat \nthere \nis \nsome\nomnipotent and sacred supremacy pertaining to a state \u2014\nto each state of our Federal Union. Our states have neither\nmore nor less power than that reserved to them in the\nUnion by the Constitution \u2014 no one of them ever having\nbeen a state out of the Union. The original ones passed into\nthe Union even before they cast o\ufb00 their British colonial\ndependence; and the new ones each came into the Union\ndirectly from a condition of dependence, excepting Texas.\nAnd even Texas, in its temporary independence, was never\ndesignated a state. The new ones only took the designation\nof states on coming into the Union, while that name was\n\ufb01rst adopted by the old ones in and by the Declaration of\nIndependence. \nTherein \nthe \n\u201cUnited \nColonies\u201d \nwere\n declared to be \u201cfree and independent states;\u201d but, even\nthen, \nthe \nobject \nplainly \nwas \nnot \nto \ndeclare \ntheir\nindependence of one another, or of the Union, but directly\nthe contrary, as their mutual pledge and their mutual action\nbefore, at the time, and afterwards, abundantly show. The\nexpress plighting of faith by each and all of the original\nthirteen in the Articles of Confederation, two years later,\nthat the Union shall be perpetual, is most conclusive.\nHaving never been states, either in substance or in name,\noutside of the Union, whence this magical omnipotence of\n\u201cstate rights,\u201d asserting a claim of power to lawfully\ndestroy the Union itself? Much is said about the\n\u201csovereignty\u201d of the states; but the word even is not in the\nnational Constitution; nor, as is believed, in any of the state\nconstitutions. What is \u201csovereignty\u201d in the political sense of\nthe term? Would it be far wrong to de\ufb01ne it \u201ca political\ncommunity without a political superior?\u201d Tested by this, no\none of our states except Texas, ever was a sovereignty. And\neven Texas gave up the character on coming into the\nUnion; by which act she acknowledged the Constitution of\nthe United States and the laws and treaties of the United\nStates made in pursuance of the Constitution, to be for her\nthe supreme law of the land. The states have their status in\nthe Union, and they have no other legal status. If they\nbreak from this, they can only do so against law and by\nrevolution. The Union, and not themselves, separately,\nprocured their independence and their liberty. By conquest\nor purchase the Union gave each of them whatever of\nindependence or liberty it has. The Union is older than any\n of the states, and, in fact, it created them as states.\nOriginally some dependent colonies made the Union, and,\nin turn, the Union threw o\ufb00 their old dependence for them,\nand made them states, such as they are. Not one of them\never had a state constitution independent of the Union. Of\ncourse, it is not forgotten that all the new states framed\ntheir \nconstitutions \nbefore \nthey \nentered \nthe \nUnion;\nnevertheless dependent upon, and preparatory to, coming\ninto the Union.\n\u201cUnquestionably the states have the powers and rights\nreserved to them in and by the national Constitution: but\namong these, surely, are not included all conceivable\npowers, however mischievous or destructive; but, at most,\nsuch only as were known in the world, at the time, as\ngovernmental powers; and, certainly, a power to destroy\nthe Government itself had never been known as a\ngovernmental \u2014 as a merely administrative power. This\nrelative matter of national power and state rights, as a\nprinciple, is no other than the principle of generality and\nlocality. Whatever concerns the whole should be con\ufb01ded to\nthe whole \u2014 to the general government; while whatever\nconcerns only the state should be left exclusively to the\nstate. This is all there is of original principle about it.\nWhether the national Constitution in de\ufb01ning boundaries\nbetween the two has applied the principle with exact\naccuracy, is not to be questioned. We are all bound by that\nde\ufb01ning, without question.\n\u201cWhat is now combated, is the position that secession is\nconsistent with the Constitution \u2014 is lawful and peaceful. Is\n is not contended that there is any express law for it; and\nnothing should ever be implied as law which leads to unjust\nor absurd consequences. The nation purchased with money\nthe countries out of which several of these states were\nformed; is it just that they shall go o\ufb00 without leave and\nwithout refunding? The nation paid very large sums (in the\naggregate, I believe, nearly a hundred millions) to relieve\nFlorida of the aboriginal tribes; is it just that she shall now\nbe o\ufb00 without consent, or without making any return? The\nnation is now in debt for money applied to the bene\ufb01t of\nthese so-called seceding states in common with the rest; is\nit just either that creditors shall go unpaid, or the\nremaining states pay the whole? A part of the present\nnational debt was contracted to pay the old debts of Texas;\nis it just that she shall leave and pay no part of this herself?\n\u201cAgain, if one state may secede, so may another; and\nwhen all shall have seceded, none is left to pay the debts. Is\nthis quite just to creditors? Did we notify them of this sage\nview of ours when we borrowed their money? If we now\nrecognize this doctrine by allowing the seceders to go in\npeace, it is di\ufb00icult to see what we can do if others choose\nto go, or to extort terms upon which they will promise to\nremain.\n\u201cThe seceders insist that our Constitution admits of\nsecession. They have assumed to make a national\nconstitution of their own, in which, of necessity, they have\neither discarded or retained the right of secession, as they\ninsist it exists in ours. If they have discarded it, they\nthereby admit that on principle it ought not to exist in ours;\n if they have retained it, by their own construction of ours\nthey show that, to be consistent, they must secede from one\nanother whenever they shall \ufb01nd it the easiest way of\nsettling their debts, or e\ufb00ecting any other sel\ufb01sh or unjust\nobject. The principle itself is one of disintegration, and\nupon which no government can possibly endure.\n\u201cIf all the states save one should assert the power to\ndrive that one out of the Union, it is presumed the whole\nclass of seceder politicians would at once deny the power,\nand denounce the act as the greatest outrage upon state\nrights. But suppose that precisely the same act, instead of\nbeing called \u2018driving the one out,\u2019 should be called \u2018the\nseceding of the others from that one,\u2019 it would be exactly\nwhat the seceders claim to do, unless, indeed, they make\nthe point that the one, because it is a minority, may\nrightfully do what the others, because they are a majority,\nmay not rightfully do. These politicians are subtle, and\nprofound on the rights of minorities. They are not partial to\nthat power which made the Constitution, and speaks from\nthe preamble, calling itself \u2018We, the people.\u2019\u201d\nThe popular government of the United States, Mr.\nLincoln said, had been called an experiment. Two points of\nthe experiment had already been settled; the government\nhad been established, and it had been administered. One\npoint \nremained \nto \nbe \nestablished: \nits \nsuccessful\nmaintenance against a formidable internal attempt to\noverthrow it. It remained to be demonstrated to the world\nthat those who could fairly carry an election could also\nsuppress a rebellion\u2014 \u201cthat ballots are the rightful and\n peaceful successors to bullets, and that when ballots have\nfairly and constitutionally decided, there can be no\nsuccessful appeal back to bullets \u2014 that there can be no\nsuccessful \nappeal, \nexcept \nto \nballots \nthemselves, \nat\nsucceeding elections.\u201d Another justi\ufb01cation of the war in\nwhich he was engaged he found in that article of the\nConstitution which provides that \u201cthe United States shall\nguarantee to every state in this Union a republican form of\ngovernment.\u201d If a state might lawfully go out of the Union,\nit might also, having gone out, discard the republican form\nof government, \u201cso that to prevent its going out is an\nindispensable means to the end of maintaining the\nguarantee mentioned; and when an end is lawful and\nobligatory, the indispensable means to it are also lawful and\nobligatory.\u201d\nCongress was ready to do all that the President desired,\nand even more. Instead of four hundred million dollars,\nthey placed at his disposal \ufb01ve hundred millions, and\ninstead of con\ufb01ning his levy of troops to four hundred\nthousand, they gave him liberty to call out half a million.\nThey also legalized all the steps he had thus far taken for\nthe suppression of the rebellion, and labored in all ways to\nstrengthen his hands and encourage his heart. These\nmeasures were passed in the presence, and against the\nprotest, of secessionists, who still held their places in both\nhouses of Congress. Burnett of Kentucky and Reid and\nNorton of Missouri, in the House, afterwards proved their\ntreason by engaging directly in the rebellion. Breckinridge\nand Powell of Kentucky and Polk and Johnson of Missouri,\n in the Senate, were known at the time to be anything but\nloyal. And they had sympathizers who, under any other\ngovernment, would have been arrested and held, if not\ntreated with still greater severity. Vallandigham of Ohio was\nafterwards sent into the rebel lines for treason, and it is\nundoubtedly true that Kennedy of Maryland, Bayard of\nDelaware, Bright of Indiana, and Ben Wood of New York\nhad personal reason for feeling that he had been very\nharshly used. Yet it was best that these men should be\nwhere they were, to bicker and bite, and illustrate the spirit\nof that incorporate infamy \u2014 a slaveholders\u2019 rebellion.\nSuch \ntoleration \nillustrated \nalike \nthe \nstrength \nand\nmoderation of the government. Some of these men were\npermitted to rise in the places they had justly forfeited,\nand, with perjured lips, to talk treason \u2014 to complain of\narbitrary arrests when they were su\ufb00ered to go and come,\nand scheme and brawl with perfect liberty, in the streets of\nthe national capital.\nThere was plenty of treasonable talk in Congress, but no\ntreasonable action. The party friends of the government\nwere in a majority, and they were aided by numbers of loyal\ndemocrats. The schemes of \ufb01nance recommended by Mr.\nChase, the Secretary of the Treasury, were adopted\nessentially as recommended, a moderate con\ufb01scation act\nwas passed, and a resolution adopted by the House \u2014\nintroduced by Mr. Crittenden of Kentucky \u2014 that the war\nhad been forced upon the country by the disunionists of the\nsouthern states, then in revolt against the constitutional\ngovernment and in arms around the capital: that Congress,\n banishing all feeling of passion or resentment, would\nrecollect only its duty to the whole country: that the war\nwas not waged on the part of the government in the spirit\nof oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or\nsubjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering\nwith the rights or established institutions of the states; but\nto defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution,\nand to preserve the Union, with all the dignities, equality\nand rights of the several states unimpaired: and that as\nsoon as those objects were accomplished, the war ought to\ncease. During the session, Mr. Trumbull or Illinois\nintroduced a bill in the Senate to emancipate all the slaves\nin the rebel states. This was a prophecy and a threat of\nwhat would come as the reward of rebel contumacy.\nThe session closed on the sixth day of August, having\nlasted but little more than a month. The President found\nhimself abundantly supported, and the means in his hands\nfor carrying on the great contest.\nThe message of Mr. Lincoln to this extra session of\nCongress, taken with his inaugural, did much to overcome\nthe unpleasant impressions produced by the speeches he\nmade on his way to Washington. There is no question that\nthose speeches seriously damaged him, and shook the\ncon\ufb01dence of the country in his ability. The inaugural and\nthe message had the old ring in them, and betrayed\nsomething of those qualities which had originally attracted\nthe country to him.\nIt is true, however, that he did not spend much time in\nwriting his messages. His later e\ufb00orts in this line did not\n bear always so many marks of painstaking as the \ufb01rst. He\nhad a great aversion to what he called \u201cmachine writing,\u201d\nand always used the fewest words possible to express his\nmeaning. Mr. Defrees, the public printer, an intimate\npersonal friend of Mr. Lincoln, testi\ufb01es that he made the\nfewest corrections in his proof of any man he ever knew. He\nknew nothing of the rules of punctuation, yet the\nmanuscripts of very few of our public men are as well\npunctuated as his uniformly were, though his use of\ncommas was excessive.\nMr. Defrees, being on easy terms with Mr. Lincoln, took it\nupon him to suggest with relation to his \ufb01rst message that\nhe was not preparing a campaign document, or delivering a\nstump speech in Illinois, but constructing an important\nstate paper, that would go down historically to all coming\ntime; and that, therefore, he did not consider the phrase,\n\u201csugar-coated,\u201d which he had introduced, as entirely a\nbecoming and digni\ufb01ed one. \u201cWell, Defrees,\u201d said Mr.\nLincoln, good naturedly, \u201cif you think the time will ever\ncome when the people will not understand what \u201csugar-\ncoated\u201d means, I\u2019ll alter it; otherwise, I think I\u2019ll let it go.\u201d\nTo make people understand exactly what he meant, was his\ngrand aim. Beyond that, he had not the slightest ambition\nto go.\nTo close this chapter, it only remains to record the relief\nof Major General McDowell, a worthy but unfortunate\no\ufb00icer, and the appointment of General McClellan to the\ncommand of the army of the Potomac. The country had\nbeen attracted to McClellan by his dispatches from Western\n Virginia. General Scott favored him, and to him was\naccordingly assigned the work of re-organizing the\nshattered army. The public hope was ready to cling\nsomewhere, and the public heart gave itself to McClellan\nwith an enthusiastic devotion rarely accorded to any man.\nHis pictures were in all the windows of the shops, and on\nall the center tables of all the drawing-rooms in the land. If\nhe had done but little before to merit this con\ufb01dence \u2014 if\nhe did but little afterwards to justify it \u2014 he, at least,\nserved at that time to give faith to the people, and furnish a\nrallying point for their patriotic service. For three months,\nunder \nhis \nfaithful \nand \nassiduous \nsupervision, \nthe\norganization of troops went on, until he had at his\ncommand a magni\ufb01cent army which needed only to be\nproperly led to be victorious.\n  ha ter   .\nTHE VICTORY OF the rebels at Bull Run was singularly\nbarren of material results to them. It did not encourage the\ndisloyal masses of the country more than it \ufb01lled with new\ndetermination the loyal people who opposed them. They\nwere as badly punished as the troops they had defeated,\nand could take no advantage of their victory; and they\nfailed to bring nearer the day of foreign recognition for\nwhich they were laboring and longing.\nThis matter of foreign recognition was a very important\none to Mr. Davis and his confederates. That he expected it,\nand had reason to expect it, there is no question. Hostilities\nhad \nhardly \nopened \nwhen \nthe \nBritish \nand \nFrench\ngovernments, acting in concert, recognized the government\nestablished at Montgomery as a belligerent power. If this\nwas not a pledge of friendliness, and a promise of\nrecognition, nothing could have been, for the proceeding\nwas unprecedented. The United States was a power in\nfriendly intercourse with these two great powers of Europe,\nthrough complete diplomatic relations. Without a word of\nwarning, without a victory on the part of the insurgents,\nwithout a confederate \ufb02eet a\ufb02oat, with only a half of the\nslave states in insurrection, these two governments, with\nthe most indecent haste, gave their moral support to the\nenemies of the United States by recognizing a portion of its\n  people engaged in an insurrection which the government\nhad not yet undertaken to suppress \u2014 as a belligerent\npower, with just the same rights on land and sea as if they\nwere an established government.\nBut for the decided position assumed by Mr. Lincoln,\nthrough his accomplished Secretary, Mr. Seward, the rebel\ngovernment would certainly have had an early and full\nrecognition. England and France were, without doubt, very\nfriendly to the United States; but they would have been\nfriendlier to two governments than to one. In his\ninstructions to Mr. Charles Francis Adams, on his departure\nto represent the government at the court of St. James, Mr.\nSeward said:\n\u201cIf, as the President does not at all apprehend, you shall\nunhappily \ufb01nd Her Majesty\u2019s government tolerating the\napplication of the so-called seceding states, or wavering\nabout it, you will not leave them to suppose, for a moment,\nthat they can grant that application, and remain the friends\nof the United States. You may even assure them promptly,\nin that case, that, if they determine to recognize, they may,\nat the same time, prepare to enter into an alliance with the\nenemies of this republic. You alone will represent your\ncountry at London, and you will represent the whole of it\nthere. When you are asked to divide that duty with others,\ndiplomatic relations between the government of Great\nBritain and this government will be suspended, and will\nremain so until it shall be seen which of the two is most\nstrongly intrenched in the con\ufb01dence of their respective\nnations and of mankind.\u201d\n Against the recognition of the rebels as a belligerent\npower, Mr. Adams was directed to make a decided and\nenergetic protest; and when, on the \ufb01fteenth of June, the\nrepresentatives of England and France at Washington\napplied to Mr. Seward for the privilege of reading to him\ncertain \ninstructions \nthey \nhad \nreceived \nfrom \ntheir\ngovernments, he declined to hear them o\ufb00icially until he\nhad had the privilege of reading them privately. This\nprivilege was accorded to him; and then he declined to\nreceive any o\ufb00icial notice of the documents. Four days\nafterwards, he wrote a letter to Mr. Adams, informing him\nof the nature of the instructions, which were prefaced by a\nstatement of the decision of the British government that\nthis country was divided into two belligerent parties, of\nwhich the government represented one; and that the\ngovernment of Great Britain proposed to assume the\nattitude of a neutral between them.\nTouching this decision, Mr. Seward said that the\ngovernment of the United States could not debate it with\nthe government of Her Majesty \u2014 much less consent to\nreceive the announcement of a decision thus derogating\nfrom the sovereignty of the United States \u2014 a decision at\nwhich it had arrived without conferring with us upon the\nquestion. \u201cThe United States,\u201d said Mr. Seward, \u201care still\nsolely and exclusively sovereign, within the territories they\nhave lawfully acquired and long possessed, as they have\nalways been. They are living under the obligations of the\nlaw of nations and of treaties with Great Britain, just the\nsame now as heretofore; they are, of course, the friend of\n Great Britain; and they insist that Great Britain shall\nremain their friend now, just as she has hitherto been.\nGreat Britain, by virtue of these relations, is a stranger to\nparties and sections in this country, whether they are loyal\nto the United States or not; and Great Britain can neither\nrightfully qualify the sovereignty of the United States, nor\nconcede nor recognize any rights or interests or power, of\nany party, state or section, in contravention to the\nunbroken sovereignty of the federal Union. What is now\nseen in this country is the occurrence, by no means\npeculiar, but frequent in all countries, more frequent in\nGreat Britain than here, of an armed insurrection, engaged\nin attempting to overthrow the regularly constituted and\nestablished government. But these incidents by no means\nconstitute a state of war, impairing the sovereignty of the\ngovernment, creating belligerent sections, and entitling\nforeign states to intervene or to act as neutrals between\nthem, or in any other way to cast o\ufb00 their lawful obligations\nto the nation thus, for the moment, disturbed. Any other\nprinciple than this would be to resolve government\neverywhere into a thing of accident and caprice, and\nultimately all human society into a state of perpetual war.\u201d\nInstructions corresponding with these were sent to our\nrepresentatives at the French and other European courts.\nThese governments were plainly given to understand that\nour \ngovernment \nconsidered \nthe \ndi\ufb00iculty \nwith \nthe\nslaveholding states to be exclusively its own \u2014 that it was\npurely a domestic rebellion, which it proposed to extinguish\nby its own power, and one in which foreign governments\n had no right to inter-meddle. Our ministers were told by\nMr. Seward that they could not be too decided or explicit in\nmaking \nknown \nto \nthe \ngovernments \nat \nwhich \nthey\nrepresented us, that there was not then, and would not be,\nany idea existing in the government of su\ufb00ering a\ndissolution of the Union to take place, in any way whatever.\nThroughout all the war that followed, England and\nFrance maintained their most unjusti\ufb01able and cruel\nrecognition of the belligerent rights of the rebels \u2014\nunjusti\ufb01able, because it was an unfriendly act toward a\nfriendly power, on behalf of a rebellion whose forces were\nstill unorganized, and whose suppression the government\nhad hardly entered upon; and cruel, because it encouraged\nthe rebels to persevere in a war which could only end in\ndefeat to them, and which was so prolonged that it made a\ndesolation of their whole country. There is probably nothing\nmore morally certain than that the expectation of full\nrecognition by England and France, on the part of Mr.\nDavis and his people, helped to continue the struggle of the\nrebellion with the government, until tens of thousands of\nloyal and disloyal lives were needlessly sacri\ufb01ced. The act\nwas unfriendly to this government; it was a cruelty to the\nhapless insurgents it deceived, for the promise it contained\nwas never redeemed, and would have accomplished\nnothing if it had been; and it was a great blunder, from\nwhich those blundering governments have retreated, amid\nthe jeers of the nations of the world, and the shu\ufb04ing\napologies of their own people. This sympathy with the\nrebellion on the part of these foreign governments is\n something not to be forgotten, because we are to measure\nby it the magnanimity of Mr. Lincoln in the treatment of\ninternational questions arising afterwards. This sympathy is\nto-day denied; it was then blatant and bellicose. An\nAmerican could not pass through England without insult;\nhe could not speak for the national cause in England\nwithout a mob. England, or all of England that had a voice,\nrejoiced in rebel successes and federal defeats, and garbled\nand quali\ufb01ed all the news which favored the prospects of\nnational success. Whatever may be the professions of\nEngland now, no true American can forget that all the\nin\ufb02uence she dared to give in favor of the rebellion was\ngiven, beginning promptly at the start; and that her\nposition rendered the task of subduing the rebellion doubly\nsevere. Whatever may be the professions of her people now,\nno true American will forget the insults that were heaped\nupon his countrymen abroad whenever an allusion was\nmade to the national di\ufb00iculties, and heaped upon the\ncountry by the issues of a press that represented the\nBritish people, and persistently misrepresented our own. It\nwas not, of course, to be expected that monarchies would\nbe friendly to the great prosperity of democracies, or that\nthey would give them their open sympathy and co-operation\nin di\ufb00iculty; but the latter should be spared receiving the\nhypocrisies of the former as courtesies; and, after having\nbeen compelled to drink of gall for four years, should be\npermitted to remember that it was gall, and to make the\nbest of it, without being persistently assured that it was\nhoney.\n The opening of the war found Colonel John C. Fremont in\nEurope; and he, with a large number of loyal Americans,\nhastened home to give their services to their country.\nColonel Fremont, defeated as the republican candidate for\nthe presidency four years before the election of Mr.\nLincoln, had had military experience, and was recognized\nas a popular man, who would rally to his command, at the\nWest, large numbers of soldiers, especially among the\nGerman population of the region. He received the\nappointment of Major-General, and on the same day (July\nth,) that General McClellan arrived in Washington to take\ncommand of the Army of the Potomac, he arrived at St.\nLouis, and entered upon the command of the Department of\nthe West, to which he had been assigned. Before General\nFremont arrived at St. Louis, a battle was fought on\nWilson\u2019s Creek by General Lyon and General Sigel, with a\nlarge force under the command of Ben McCulloch. It was\nthe second considerable battle of the war, and resulted in\nthe death of General Lyon himself, and the \ufb01nal orderly\nretreat of the federal forces under Sigel. General Lyon had\nin\ufb02icted, with his little force of six thousand men, such\ninjury upon McCulloch\u2019s twenty-two thousand, that the\nlatter could not pursue; and, on the whole, there was no\nspecial discouragement as the result of the defeat.\nGeneral Fremont\u2019s name had a great charm for the\nwestern masses, and especially for the Germans; and\nvolunteers in large numbers sought service under him. His\ncampaign, upon the organization of which he entered with\ngreat energy, contemplated not only the restoration of\n order in Missouri, but the reclaiming the control of the\nMississippi River. For this latter object, he organized a gun-\nboat service, which was destined to play a very important\npart in the operations associated with the western inland\nwaters.\nMissouri was in a condition of most unhappy disorder. It\nwas a border slave state, containing many disunionists of\nits own, and abounding with secession emissaries from\nother states, determined to carry it over to the confederacy.\nBrother was arrayed against brother. Neighborhoods were\ndistressed with deadly feuds. Murders were of every-day\noccurrence on every hand, and outrages of every kind were\nrife. The civil administration of the state was altogether\nunreliable; and on the thirty-\ufb01rst of August, General\nFremont issued a proclamation declaring martial law,\nde\ufb01ning the lines of the army of occupation, and\nthreatening with death by the bullet all who should be\nfound within those lines with arms in their hands.\nFurthermore, the real and personal property of all persons\nin the state who should take up arms against the United\nStates was declared con\ufb01scated to the public use, and their\nslaves, if they had any, were declared free men.\nThis proclamation produced a strong e\ufb00ect upon the\npublic mind. The proclaiming of freedom to the slaves of\nrebels struck the popular chord, particularly among\nthoroughly loyal men in the free states. Of course, it\nmaddened \nall \nthe \nsympathizers \nwith \nthe \nrebellion,\ninfuriated the rebels themselves, and perplexed those loyal\nmen who had upon their hands the task of so conducting\n a\ufb00airs as to hold to their allegiance the border slave states\nwhich had not seceded.\nMr. Lincoln did not approve some features of General\nFremont\u2019s proclamation. As soon as he read it, he wrote,\nunder date of September second, to the General, that there\nwere two points in it which gave him anxiety. The \ufb01rst was,\nthat, if he should shoot a man according to his\nproclamation, \u201cthe confederates would certainly shoot our\nbest men in their hands in retaliation, and so, man for man,\ninde\ufb01nitely.\u201d He therefore ordered him to allow no man to\nbe shot under the proclamation without \ufb01rst having his (the\nPresident\u2019s) approbation or consent. The second cause of\nanxiety was that the paragraph relating to the con\ufb01scation\nof property and the liberation of slaves of traitorous owners\nwould alarm Unionists at the South, and perhaps ruin the\nfair prospect of saving Kentucky to the Union. He,\ntherefore, wished General Fremont, as of his own motion,\nso to modify his proclamation as to make it conformable to\nthe con\ufb01scation act just passed by the extra session of\nCongress, which only freed such slaves as were engaged in\nthe rebel service. Mr. Lincoln did not wish to interfere with\nGeneral Fremont, or unreasonably to curtail his authority,\nalthough he had assumed an unwarrantable responsibility\nin taking so important a step without consultation or notice.\nCongress had had that very matter in hand, and had\nembodied its opinion in an act. To this act he wished to\nhave the General conform his proclamation, and that was\nall he desired. The wisdom of his criticism of the \ufb01rst point\nwas proved by a document issued by the rebel Je\ufb00\n Thompson on the same day he wrote it. \u201cJe\ufb00 Thompson,\nBrigadier General of the \ufb01rst military district of Missouri,\u201d\nacting under the state government, did \u201cmost solemnly\npromise\u201d that for every soldier of the state guard, \u201cor\nsoldier of our allies, the armies of the confederate States,\u201d\nwho should be put to death under the proclamation, he\nwould \u201chang, draw and quarter a minion of Abraham\nLincoln.\u201d\nGeneral \nFremont \nreceived \nthe \nPresident\u2019s \nletter\nrespectfully, and replied to it September eighth, stating the\ndi\ufb00iculties under which he labored, with communication\nwith the government so di\ufb00icult, and the development of\nperplexing events so rapid in the department under his\ncommand. As to the part of his proclamation concerning\nthe slaves, he wished the President openly to order the\nchange desired, as, if he should do it of his own motion, it\nwould imply that he thought himself wrong, and that he\nhad acted without the re\ufb02ection which the gravity of the\npoint demanded. This the President did, in a dispatch under\ndate of September eleventh, in the words: \u201cIt is therefore\nordered that the said clause of said proclamation be so\nmodi\ufb01ed, held, and construed, as to conform to, and not to\ntranscend, the provisions on the same subject contained in\nthe act of Congress entitled, \u2018An act to con\ufb01scate property\nused for insurrectionary purposes,\u2019 approved August ,\n; and that such act be published at length with this\norder.\u201d Before this order had been received, or on the day\nfollowing its date, General Fremont, though acquainted\nwith the President\u2019s wishes, manumitted two slaves of\n Thomas L. Snead of St. Louis, in accordance with the terms\nof his proclamation.\nAlthough Mr. Lincoln desired General Fremont so to\nmodify his proclamation as to make it accordant with the\nact of Congress approved August sixth, it is hardly to be\nsupposed that he did it solely out of respect to that act.\nCongressional acts that were passed under certain\ncircumstances, could not be regarded as binding the hands\nof the executive under all circumstances; and when, in a\nstate of war, circumstances were widely changing with the\npassage of every day, they would be a poor rule of military\naction. If he had believed that the time had come for the\nmeasure of liberating the slaves of rebels by proclamation,\nthe act of Congress would not have stood in his way. This\nact was an embodiment of his policy at that time, and he\nused it for his immediate purpose.\nThe day after he gave his modifying order, he received a\nletter from Hon. Joseph Holt of Kentucky, in which that\ngentleman spoke of the alarm and condemnation with\nwhich the Union-loving citizens of that state had read the\nproclamation, and begged him to modify it by an order such\nas he had already issued. Judge Holt concluded his letter by\nsaying: \u201cThe magnitude of the interest at stake, and my\nextreme desire that by no misapprehension of your\nsentiments or purposes shall the power and fervor of the\nloyalty of Kentucky be at this moment abated or chilled,\nmust be my apology for the frankness with which I have\naddressed you.\u201d\n Complications in the personal relations of General\nFremont and Colonel F.P. Blair, under whose personal and\nfamily in\ufb02uence General Fremont had received his position,\noccurred at an early day. Colonel Blair doubtless thought\nthat he had not su\ufb00icient weight in the General\u2019s counsels,\nand the General, doubtless, exercised his right, in choosing\nhis own counselors. Whether he followed the advice of\nothers, or was guided by his own judgment and impulses,\nhe conducted himself quite as much after the manner of an\neastern satrap as a republican commander. The public\nfound it di\ufb00icult to get at him, he kept around him a large\nretinue, and dispensed patronage and contracts with a\nright royal hand. The most there is to be said of the matter,\nis, that it was his way. Power was in his hands, a great work\nwas before him, great personal popularity attended him,\nand the sudden elevation was not without its e\ufb00ect upon\nhim. Colonel Blair, who was the gallant commander of the\nFirst Missouri Volunteers, stood in a peculiar relation to\nhim, and was not, by virtue of that relation, and by reason\nof a high and worthily won political and social position, to\nbe lightly put aside. He came down upon his superior with\na series of charges which covered a long catalogue of sins:\n\u2014 neglect of duty, uno\ufb00icerlike conduct, disobedience of\norders, conduct unbecoming a gentleman, extravagance\nand the waste of the public moneys, and despotic and\ntyrannical \nconduct. \nAmong \nthe \nspeci\ufb01cations \nwere\nFremont\u2019s alleged failure to repair at once to St. Louis to\nenter upon his duties; his neglecting to reinforce Lyon and\nMulligan; his su\ufb00ering Brigadier-General Hurlburt, \u201ca\n common drunkard,\u201d to continue in command; his refusal to\nsee people who sought his presence on matters of urgent\nbusiness; his violation of the presidential order in the\nmatter of his proclamation and the manumissions under it;\nhis persistency in keeping disreputable persons in his\nemploy; and his unjust suppression of the St. Louis Evening\nNews. General Fremont had no better opinion of Colonel\nBlair than Blair had of him, and placed him under arrest for\nalluding disrespectfully to superior o\ufb00icers.\nIt was a very unhappy quarrel, and it is quite likely that\nthere was blame upon both sides, though it occurred\nbetween men equally devoted to the sacred cause of saving\nthe country to freedom and justice. It is not necessary to\nbelieve, with the enemies of General Fremont, that he\nfound the country going to pieces and intended to place\nhimself at the head of a huge north-western fraction; nor,\nwith the enemies of Colonel Blair, that he was o\ufb00ended\nwith his General because he could not have as good a\nchance at stealing from the government as was believed to\nbe accorded to some of the General\u2019s California friends.\nBoth were loyal men, both were anti-slavery men \u2014 Colonel\nBlair being quite the equal of General Fremont in this\nrespect \u2014 and both wished to serve their country. Mr.\nLincoln always gave to each the credit due to his motives,\nand so far refused to mingle in the general quarrel that\ngrew out of the di\ufb00iculty, that he kept the good-will of both\nsides, and compelled them to settle their own di\ufb00erences.\nOn the sixth of September, General Grant, under General\nFremont\u2019s command, occupied Paducah, Kentucky, at the\n mouth of the Tennessee River. Price and Jackson were\nraising a formidable army for service in Missouri, and, on\nthe twelfth of September, compelled the surrender of\nColonel Mulligan and his forces at Lexington. General\nFremont at length took the \ufb01eld in person. On the eighth of\nOctober he left Je\ufb00erson City for Sedalia. As he advanced\nwith his forces, Price retreated, until it was widely reported\nthat he would give battle to the national forces at\nSpring\ufb01eld. Just as Fremont was making ready to engage\nthe enemy, he was overtaken by an order relieving him of\nhis command. He was succeeded by General Hunter; but\nHunter\u2019s command was brief, and was transferred at an\nearly day to General Halleck.\nGeneral Fremont was relieved of his command by the\nPresident not because of his proclamation, not because he\nhated slavery, and not because he believed him corrupt or\nvindictive or disloyal. He relieved him simply because he\nbelieved that the interests of the country, all things\nconsidered, would be subserved by relieving him and\nputting another man in his place. The matter was the cause\nof great excitement in Missouri, and of much complaint\namong the radical antislavery men of the country: but the\nimputations sought to be cast upon the President were not\nfastened to him; and did not, four years later, when\nFremont himself became a candidate for the presidency,\nprevent the warmest anti-slavery men from giving Mr.\nLincoln their support.\nThe federal army under General Hunter retreated\nwithout a battle; and thus the campaign, inaugurated with\n great show and immense expense, was a \ufb02at failure.\nIn the meantime, General Rosecrans \ufb01nished up the work\nin \nWestern \nVirginia \nthat \nGeneral \nMcClellan \nhad\nprematurely declared, accomplished, and the army of the\nPotomac, under the latter General, was swelling in\nnumbers, and active in organization and discipline. General\nMcClellan\u2019s popularity with the army was very great. They\nfelt his organizing hand, and regarded him with the\nproudest con\ufb01dence. The country, however, was becoming\nimpatient with him. He would spare no men for any outside\nenterprises, and still rolled up the numbers of his\ncumbersome forces, though good roads lay in front, and\npleasant weather invited to action. On the twenty-ninth of\nAugust, General Butler, acting with a naval force under\nCommodore Stringham, took possession of the Hatteras\nforts, with a force which he had raised independently for\nthe expedition. This gave great satisfaction to the country,\nand helped to keep up the popular courage under the\ndepressing in\ufb02uence of delay on the part of the army of the\nPotomac.\nIn the month of August, Munson\u2019s Hill, within view of the\ncapitol, was occupied by the rebel forces; and, though they\nwere not strong in numbers, and took but limited pains to\nintrench themselves, they remained there undisturbed until\nnearly the last of September, when they left of their own\naccord. On the twenty-\ufb01rst of October, there occurred a\ndisastrous battle and blunder at Ball\u2019s Blu\ufb00. It was a sad\nfailure to ful\ufb01ll the promise of a magni\ufb01cent preparation\nfor action. The country was disappointed and indignant.\n The number killed, drowned, wounded and captured was\neleven hundred \u2014 full half that went into the action. Here\nColonel Baker, the President\u2019s friend, fell; and, although\nGeneral McClellan, in his report of the a\ufb00air, said that,\n\u201csituated as their troops were \u2014 cut o\ufb00 alike from retreat\nor reinforcements \u2014 \ufb01ve thousand against one thousand\nseven hundred \u2014 it was not possible that the issue could\nhave been successful,\u201d the unmilitary mind will still inquire\nwhy, with an immense army but a few miles away, they\nwere left or placed where reinforcement and retreat were\nalike impossible?\nGeneral Scott did not like the looks or management of\nmilitary a\ufb00airs, and felt that his place was becoming\nunpleasant. Only a few days after the a\ufb00air at Ball\u2019s Blu\ufb00,\nhe made known to Mr. Lincoln his desire to be released\nfrom all active duties, in consequence of his increasing\nphysical in\ufb01rmity. In a letter dated November \ufb01rst, the\nPresident acceded to his request, and added: \u201cThe\nAmerican people will hear with sadness and deep emotion\nthat General Scott has withdrawn from the active control of\nthe army, while the President and the unanimous Cabinet\nexpress their own and the nation\u2019s sympathy in his personal\na\ufb04iction, and their profound sense of the important public\nservices rendered by him to his country, during his long\nand brilliant public career, among which will ever be\ngratefully distinguished his faithful devotion to the\nConstitution, the Union and the \ufb02ag, when assailed by\nparricidal rebellion.\u201d To do all possible honor to the noble\nveteran who had stood by the country when so many army\n o\ufb00icers had gone over to the rebellion under the appeal of\nsectional friendship \u2014 an appeal made to him with all the\npersuasions that ingenuity could devise \u2014 the President\nand his entire Cabinet waited upon him at his residence;\nand there, with his Secretaries around him, Mr. Lincoln\nread to him his letter. It was a grand moment in the old\nman\u2019s life. \u201cThis honor overwhelms me,\u201d he responded. \u201cIt\noverpays all services I have attempted to render to my\ncountry. If I had any claims before, they are all obliterated\nby this expression of approval by the President, with the\nunanimous support of the Cabinet. I know the President\nand this Cabinet well \u2014 I know that the country has placed\nits interests in this trying crisis in safe keeping. Their\ncouncils are wise; their labors are untiring as they are\nloyal, and their course is the right one.\u201d\nThus, after \ufb01fty-three years of service in the armies of his\ncountry, General Scott went into his nobly earned\nretirement, with the blessing of his government and the\nblessing of his country upon his venerable head; and it is\none of the sweetest satisfactions of both to remember that\nhe lived to see his country\u2019s enemies vanquished, and to\nhear of those who taunted him with faithlessness to his\nsectional \nfriends, \nhumbly \nseeking \npardon \nof \nthe\ngovernment which they had outraged, and which he had so\nloyally supported.\nOn General Scott\u2019s retirement, General McClellan held\nthe highest rank in the army, and was intrusted with the\nchief command.\n During the month of November, the Union forces\nachieved several important and encouraging successes.\nSouth Carolina was invaded by an expedition under the\njoint command of General T.W. Sherman and Commodore\nDupont; the latter of whom achieved a brilliant naval\nvictory \nin \nPort \nRoyal \nHarbor. \nGenerals \nGrant \nand\nMcClernand, with a force of three thousand \ufb01ve hundred\nmen, attacked a rebel camp in Missouri under General\nPolk, captured twelve guns, burned their camp, and took\nbaggage, horses and many prisoners. The rebels were\nafterwards reinforced, and compelled the Union forces to\nreturn to their transports. Notwithstanding the fact that the\nrebels claimed a victory, the results were substantially with\ntheir assailants. General Buckner, with whom McClellan\nwas alleged to have made his treaty of neutrality, had\nthrown o\ufb00 his neutral mask, and was gathering an army of\nrebels in Kentucky, co-operating with General Bragg who\nwas invading the state with the determination to force it\ninto secession. To meet and repel this invasion, General\nW.T. Sherman advanced with a large force to Bowling\nGreen, while General Nelson, on his left, gained a decisive\nvictory over the rebels under Colonel Williams. The various\noperations of the Union forces broke up the rebel project of\nsubjugation, and re-invigorated the e\ufb00orts of the Union\nmen to hold the state to its loyalty. General Halleck was\nappointed to the command of the army of the West, and\nGeneral Buell took General W.T. Sherman\u2019s command in\nKentucky.\n The question of slavery was an ever-present one during\nall the operations of the year. The instructions given by the\nWar Department to General Butler on the eighth of August,\nwere based upon \u201cthe desire of the President that all\nexisting rights in all the states should be respected and\nmaintained;\u201d yet it was declared that \u201cthe rights dependent\non the laws of the states within which military operations\nare conducted must necessarily be subordinate to the\nmilitary exigencies created by the insurrection, if not\nwholly forfeited by the treasonable conduct of the parties\nclaiming them.\u201d The di\ufb00iculty of settling the claims of loyal\nmasters was such that it was recommended to receive all\nfugitives, keep a record of them, and set them to work.\nCongress, the Secretary of War believed, would provide for\nthe repayment of loyal masters. On the departure of\nGeneral T.W. Sherman on his expedition to Port Royal, Mr.\nCameron referred him to the letter to General Butler on\nthis subject. He was directed to receive the services of any\npersons, whether fugitives from labor or not, who should\no\ufb00er them to the national government. These fugitives\nmight be organized into \u201csquads, companies, or otherwise,\u201d\nthough that liberty was not intended to mean a general\narming of them for military service. Loyal masters were to\nbe assured, meantime, that Congress would provide for\nthem a just compensation for services thus lost to them.\nThe time for emancipation had not come, in the opinion of\nthe government. That Mr. Lincoln desired it, none can\ndoubt; but he had undertaken to save the Union under the\nConstitution \u2014 to save the Union while preserving inviolate\n all the rights of all the states. He so understood the oath by\nwhich he was invested with power. Whatever might be his\nhatred of slavery \u2014 and it was the intensest passion of his\nlife \u2014 he could only interfere with it as a military necessity\n\u2014 an essential means of saving the Union.\n   ha ter    .\nMR. LINCOLN HAD reached the pinnacle of his life. By\ncareful and painful steps he had mounted from the foot of\nthe ladder of American society to its topmost round. He had\ndone this by the forces of his nature and character, without\nadventitious aids, or favoring circumstances. He had\naccomplished the greatest work for his country and for\nmankind that had ever been committed to a mortal to\nperform. A great nation had been saved from wreck by his\nhands; a race had been disenthralled by his word and his\npolicy; and a popular government had been established in\nthe faith and a\ufb00ections of its subjects, and in the respect of\nthe governments of the world. His enemies had been\nsilenced, his friends had been reassured, his motives and\nhis policy had been vindicated, and his person had come to\nbe regarded with tender a\ufb00ection by tens of millions of\nmen. Up to him were wafted the acclamations of millions of\nfreemen. \nAcross \nthe \nocean \ncame \nappreciative \nand\nplauditory words from other continents. Benedictions were\nbreathed upon him by multitudes of humble people whom\nhe had enfranchised. Is it strange that the instincts of his\nown logical mind should forecast death as the next logical\nstep in such a course?\nThroughout all the later months and years of the war, he\nhad freely said that he did not expect to outlast the\n rebellion; but in the \ufb02ush of triumph, \u2014 in his large, loving,\nand liberal plans for the good of the people whom the\nfortunes of war had left at his feet, \u2014 in his dreams of the\nfuture Union and harmony of the states, \u2014 he forgot this,\nand was hopeful and happy. He talked to his friends, his\ncabinet, and his family cheerfully of the future, and\ngratefully of the past. He had no resentment to gratify, no\nrevenge to in\ufb02ict, no malicious passion that clamored for\nindulgence. The thought of being able to prove to the\npeople of the South that he owed them no ill-will, and the\ndetermination to deal with them as gently as would be for\nthe public safety, \ufb01lled his magnanimous spirit with the\nsweetest satisfaction.\nIt is hardly to be supposed that the possibility of\nassassination was ever long absent from his mind, during\nthe four years of his presidency. The threats began before\nhe left Spring\ufb01eld for Washington. The attempt to\nassassinate him was made upon the train that bore him\nfrom his home. It was repeated upon that which bore him\nfrom Cincinnati. He ran through the meshes of a conspiracy\nagainst his life at Baltimore. He was in the constant receipt\nof threatening letters; and these were kept in a package by\nthemselves, appropriately labeled. He did not permit these,\nhowever, to trouble him, regarding them as only the\nmalicious missives of bullies and cowards. He undoubtedly\nregarded himself as always in a dangerous position, though\nthe fact had no tendency to make him careful of himself. He\nreasoned upon this, as upon other subjects, and could\nnever see that anything would be gained by his death. He\n had no comprehension of the malice that would delight in\nhis assassination, as a measure of revenge. He supposed\nthat every man would require some rational purpose to be\nanswered by so terrible a crime. \u201cIf they kill me,\u201d said he,\non one occasion, \u201cthe next man will be just as bad for them;\nand, in a country like this, where our habits are simple, and\nmust be, assassination is always possible, and will come if\nthey are determined upon it.\u201d He went to and from the War\nDepartment with perfect freedom; drove out to the\nSoldiers\u2019 Home, his summer residence, and back at night,\noften in an open carriage, alone. He walked the streets of\nWashington at night, with only an unarmed companion,\nwho trembled with the apprehension of the possible\nconsequences of such an exposure. Mr. Seward, in reply to\na letter from Hon. John Bigelow, the American consul in\nParis, wrote under date of July th, : \u201cThere is no\ndoubt that, from a period anterior to the breaking out of\nthe insurrection, plots and conspiracies for the purposes of\nassassination have been frequently formed and organized.\u201d\nMr. Bigelow had reported to Mr. Seward a plot which had\nbecome known abroad. Mr. Seward added: \u201cAssassination is\nnot an American practice or habit; and one so vicious and\nso desperate cannot be engrafted into our political system.\nThis conviction of mine has steadily gained strength since\nthe civil war began. Every day\u2019s experience con\ufb01rms it.\u201d\nNotwithstanding Mr. Seward\u2019s theory, plots were formed\nagainst his own life, as well as that of Mr. Lincoln \u2014 plots,\nindeed, embracing more than these two persons, and\nextending to nearly all the prominent men in the\n government and in its military service. General Grant and\nGeneral Sherman were both the unconscious objects of\ndeadly conspiracies. It is now known that, not only in the\nStates, but in Canada and Europe, plots of this character\nwere concocted; and it is believed that, on one occasion,\nthe President actually took poison, in the drugs that were\nprescribed for him by his physician, and prepared in one of\nthe shops of the city.\nSecretary Seward, even before he came so near to death\nthrough one of these conspiracies, was compelled to give\nup his theory, and to acknowledge that he and the\nPresident were in positive danger.\nThe morning of the fourteenth of April was spent by Mr.\nLincoln mainly in interviews with his friends. Among those\nwho called was Speaker Colfax, who was about setting out\nupon an overland journey to the Paci\ufb01c coast, a journey\nwhich has since been satisfactorily accomplished; and to\nhim the President entrusted a verbal message to the\nminers, assuring them of his friendliness to their interests,\nand telling them that their prosperity was identi\ufb01ed with\nthe prosperity of the nation. General Grant, it will be\nremembered, was in the city; and he was invited to be\npresent at the cabinet meeting held during the day. In\npublic and social duties the day passed away; and in the\nevening Mr. Colfax came again. George Ashmun of\nMassachusetts also came in, and to him Mr. Lincoln gave\nthe following little note in pencil \u2014 the last words he ever\nwrote:\n \u201cAllow Mr. Ashmun and friend to come in at  A.M. to-\nmorrow.\n\u201cA Lincoln.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln and General Grant were the lions of the day;\nand the manager of Ford\u2019s theater, with a keen eye to\nbusiness, had not only invited them to witness that night\nthe \nrepresentation \nof \n\u201cOur \nAmerican \nCousin,\u201d \nbut\nannounced them both as positively to be present. The\nWashington papers of the fourteenth contained the\nfollowing \u201cpersonal notice:\u201d\n\u201cLieutenant-general Grant, President and Mrs. Lincoln,\nand ladies, will occupy the state box at Ford\u2019s theater to-\nnight, to witness Miss Laura Keene\u2019s company in Tom\nTaylor\u2019s \u2018American Cousin.\u2019\u201d\nGeneral Grant did not desire to attend, and so left the\ncity. \nThe \nPresident \nwas \nequally \ndisinclined \nto \nthe\nentertainment; but, as his presence and that of General\nGrant also had been pledged to the people, he saw that\nthere would be great disappointment if he should fail them;\nand, when Mrs. Lincoln entered the President\u2019s room to\ninquire what decision he had arrived at, he said that he had\nconcluded to go. He invited both Mr. Ashmun and Mr.\nColfax to accompany him, but both declined, pleading other\nengagements; and Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln, attended to the\ncarriage by Mr. Ashmun, left without other company, and\ndrove directly to the house of Senator Harris, where they\ntook in Miss Harrill, a daughter of the Senator, and Major\nRathbone, a son of the Senator\u2019s wife, who happened to be\nin at the time. The party reached the theater at twenty\n minutes before nine o\u2019clock, to \ufb01nd the house \ufb01lled in every\npart; and, as they passed to their seats in the private box\nreserved for them, the whole assembly rose and cheered\nthem, \nwith \nthe \nmost \ncordial \nenthusiasm. \nThis\ndemonstration was intended as an expression of good-will,\nand as a popular congratulation on the victories that had\nbrought the rebellion to a close. The President bowed to\nthe audience, took his seat, and was soon afterwards\nabsorbed in the scenes of mimic life upon the stage. Here\nlet us leave him, to trace the movements of another person.\nAt half-past eleven o\u2019clock, on the morning of the\nfourteenth, John Wilkes Booth, a young actor who had been\nopenly disloyal throughout the war, visited Ford\u2019s theater,\nwhere he was informed that a box had been taken for the\nPresident and General Grant. Then he went to a stable, and\nengaged a high-strung mare for a saddle-ride, which he\nproposed to take in the middle of the afternoon. From the\nstable he proceeded to the Kirkwood Hotel, where he sent\nup to Vice-president Johnson a card, bearing the words: \u201cI\ndon\u2019t wish to disturb you; are you at home?\u201d To this, his\nsignature was appended; and it drew from Mr. Johnson only\nthe response that he was very busily engaged. At four\no\u2019clock, he called for the mare, and rode away, leaving her\nat last at a point convenient for his further purposes. In the\nevening, he took her from her hiding-place, and rode to the\ntheater. Summoning one Spangler, a scene-shifter, he left\nthe animal in his charge, to be held until he should return.\nThen he ascended to the dress-circle, looked in upon the\nstage and the audience, and gradually worked his way\n through the crowd packed in the rear of the dress-circle,\ntoward the box occupied by the Presidential party. This box\nwas at the end of the dress-circle, next the stage; and was\nreached by passing in the rear of the dress-circle, to a door\nopening \ufb01rst into a dark, narrow passage, and then by two\ndoors opening from the passage. This passage was\ncontrived so that the box might be made a double one,\nwhen occasion required, by securing facilities for a double\nentrance, an inside sliding partition completing the\narrangement. To the entrance of this passage, Booth forced\nhimself; and, after showing a card to the President\u2019s\nservant, and saying that Mr. Lincoln had sent for him, he\npassed into the passage, and fastened the door behind him.\nPresenting himself at the door of the box, he took a quick\nsurvey of the interior. He found everything favorable to his\npurpose; and, taking a small Derringer pistol in one hand,\nand a double-edged dagger in the other, he thrust his arm\ninto the entrance, where the President, sitting in an arm-\nchair, presented to his full view the back and side of his\nhead. A \ufb02ash, a sharp report, a pu\ufb00 of smoke, and the fatal\nbullet had entered the President\u2019s brain. Mr. Lincoln did\nnot stir. People thought that the report of the pistol had\nsome connection with the play; but the awful truth was\nsoon apparent. There was no escape for the murderer by\nthe way through which he had reached the box; for the\ncrowd was too great. Major Rathbone, the instant he\ncomprehended what was done, sprang upon Booth, who,\nthrowing him o\ufb00, dropped his pistol, and struck him with\nhis dagger, in\ufb02icting a \ufb02esh wound upon the o\ufb00icer\u2019s arm.\n Then the murderer rushed to the front of the box, parted\nthe folds of the \ufb02ag with which it was draped for the\noccasion, and leaped to the stage, half falling as he\ndescended, his spurs having caught in the drapery. Then\nspringing to his feet, he uttered with theatrical emphasis\nthe words of the state motto of Virginia: \u201cSic semper\ntyrannis!\u201d and added: \u201cThe South is avenged.\u201d Quickly\nturning, he rushed from the stage, striking from his path all\nwhom he met, and, escaping at the rear of the theater, was\nin his saddle and away before the party around the\nPresident and the audience fully comprehended what had\nbeen done. Only a single man in the audience took in at\nonce the meaning of the scene; and, although he undertook\nto follow Booth, the assassin had disappeared before he\nreached the door.\nMrs. Lincoln screamed, and Miss Harris called for water.\nThe scene among the audience de\ufb01es all description.\nWomen shrieked and fainted. Men called for vengeance.\nThe most terrible uproar prevailed. Laura Keene, the\nactress, begged the audience to be calm, abd entered the\nbox from the stage, bearing water and cordials. The\nPresident was entirely unconscious; and, as soon as the\nsurgeons, \nwho \nhad \ngathered \nquickly \nyo \nhim, \nhad\nascertained the position and nature of the wound, the\nhelpless form was borne across Tenth street to the house of\na Mr. Peterson. Surgeon-general Barnes, after examination,\npronounced the wound a mortal one. The words fell upon\nthe ears of Secretary Stanton, who, bursting into tears,\nresponded: \u201cOh, no! General, no, no!\u201d Attorney-general\n Speed, Secretary Welles, Postmaster-general Dennison,\nGeneral Meigs, Mr. McCulloch, the new Secretary of the\nTreasury, and Senator Sumner were gathered around the\nbed, the last holding one of the President\u2019s hands, and\nsobbing like a child. In an adjoining room, supported by her\nson Robert and Mrs. Senator Dixon, sat Mrs. Lincoln,\nbewildered and crushed by her great grief. Around the\nunconscious form of the President the great men of the\nnation bowed, and wept, watching the heaving of his\nbreast, until, at twenty-two minutes past seven in the\nmorning, he breathed his last.\nIn another part of the city, at the moment of the murder\nand alarm at the theater, another scene of terrible violence\nwas enacted, which showed that one of the many\nconspiracies that had been organized to destroy the heads\nof the government was in process of execution.\nA few days previously, Mr. Seward had been thrown from\nhis carriage, and severely injured. He was still very low,\nand under the most careful medical and surgical treatment.\nA little after ten, on this fatal evening, the door-bell of his\nresidence was rung by a man who said he came with\nmedicine from Dr. Verdi, Mr. Seward\u2019s physician, which it\nwas necessary for him to deliver in person. The servant\nwho admitted him protested that no one was permitted to\nsee Mr. Seward. The man pushed him aside, and mounted\nthe stairs. When he was about to enter the Secretary\u2019s\nroom, \nMr. \nFrederick \nSeward, \nthe \nSecretary\u2019s \nson,\nappeared, and inquired his business. He gave the same\nreply that he had given to the servant, when the gentleman\n told him that he could not enter. In return for this refusal,\nMr. Frederick Seward received a stunning blow upon his\nforehead, with the butt of a pistol; and the man pushed on\nto the bedside of the Secretary, mounted the bed, and,\naiming at Mr. Seward\u2019s throat, stabbed him three times. He\nwould undoubtedly have killed him, had he not been seized\naround the body by the nurse of Mr. Seward, a soldier\nnamed Robinson. While the assassin was struggling with\nRobinson, Mr. Seward summoned su\ufb00icient strength to roll\nhimself o\ufb00 the bed. The murderer, in\ufb02icting severe wounds\nupon Robinson, burst away from him, rushed to the door,\nforced his way down stairs, stabbing Major Augustus\nSeward and one of his father\u2019s attendants on the way, and\nescaped into the street. He had stabbed no less than \ufb01ve\npersons. This conspirator, known afterward to the public by\nthe name of Payne, was Lewis Payne Powell.\nThe e\ufb00ect of these two tragedies upon the popular\nfeeling in the city of Washington may possibly be imagined,\nbut it cannot be described. Some cried for retaliation upon\nthe leaders of a rebellion that could inspire such deeds, and\nfor revenge even upon the helpless prisoners in our hands.\nOthers were possessed by a sense of horror; others by\nemotions of terror; others by an overwhelming grief; and all\nby a feeling of uncertainty and insecurity. How wide was\nthe conspiracy? How comprehensive was the plot? Who\nwere the designated victims? What would be the next\ndevelopment? There was no sleep in Washington that night.\nA terrible solemnity took possession of the noisy capital.\nOnly the military were busy. All the drinking shops of the\n city were closed, the outlets of the city were guarded, and\nevery necessary step was taken for the protection of the\npersons of the other members of the government.\nThe e\ufb00ect of these terrible events upon the popular heart\nthroughout the country was touching in the extreme. From\nthe sunniest hills of joy, the people went down weeping into\nthe darkest valleys of a\ufb04iction. The long, sad morning of\nthe President\u2019s death was full of the sound of tolling bells.\nIt was everywhere the same. By a common impulse the\nbells from every tower in the land gave voice to the popular\ngrief; and from every dwelling and store and shop, from\nevery church and public building, the insignia of sorrow\nwere displayed. The markets were literally cleared of every\nfabric that could be used for the drapery of mourning. Men\nmet in the streets, and pressed each other\u2019s hands in\nsilence, or burst into tears. The whole nation, which, the\nprevious day, was jubilant and hopeful, was precipitated\ninto the depths of a profound and tender woe. Millions felt\nthat they had lost a brother, or a father, or a dear personal\nfriend. It was a grief that brought the nation more into\nfamily sympathy than it had been since the days of the\nRevolution. Men came together in public meetings, to give\nexpression to their grief. The day on which the murder was\nannounced to the country was Saturday; and on Sunday all\nthe churches were draped with mourning; and from every\npulpit in the land came the voice of lamentation over the\nnational loss, and of eulogy to the virtues of the good\nPresident who had been so cruelly murdered. There were\nmen engaged in the rebellion who turned from the deed\n with horror. Many of these had learned something of the\nmagnanimity of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s character; and they felt that\nthe time would come when the South would need his\nfriendship. These regarded his death as a great calamity;\nbut it must seem doubtful whether those who could starve\nhelpless prisoners, and massacre black soldiers after they\nhad surrendered, and murder in cool blood hundreds of\nUnion men, for no crime but a\ufb00ection for the government\nwhich Mr. Lincoln represented, could have been greatly\nshocked by his assassination. They made haste, however, to\ndisown and denounce the deed; and pretended to regard it,\nnot as an act of the rebellion, but as the irresponsible act of\na crazed desperado.\nAfter the death of the President, his body was removed to\nthe White House, from which he had gone on the previous\nevening, under such happy circumstances. A room had\nbeen prepared for its reception; and there it was placed in\na co\ufb00in, which rested upon a grand catafalque. The\na\ufb00ection and grief of the people were manifested by\no\ufb00erings of \ufb02owers, with which the room was kept\nconstantly supplied. On Monday, the seventeenth, a\nmeeting of congressmen and others was held at the\nCapitol, presided over by Hon. Lafayette S. Foster of\nConnecticut. A committee, of which Senator Sumner of\nMassachusetts was chairman, was appointed to make\narrangements for the funeral; and this committee reported\nat an adjourned meeting, held at four o\u2019clock in the\nafternoon, that they had selected as pall-bearers Messrs.\nFoster, Morgan, Johnson, Yates, Wade, and Conness, on the\n part of the Senate, and Messrs. Dawes, Co\ufb00roth, Smith,\nColfax, Worthington, and Washburne, on the part of the\nHouse. They also presented the names of gentlemen, one\nfrom each state and territory of the Union, to act as a\ncongressional committee, to accompany the remains to\ntheir \ufb01nal resting-place in Illinois.\nMeantime, \nthe \nbody \nof \nthe \nPresident \nhad \nbeen\nembalmed; and, at ten o\u2019clock, on Tuesday morning, the\nWhite House was thrown open to give the people an\nopportunity to take their farewell of the familiar face,\nwhose kind smile death had forever quenched. At least\ntwenty-\ufb01ve thousand persons availed themselves of this\nliberty; and thousands more, seeing the crowd, turned back\nunsatis\ufb01ed. Hundreds of those who pressed around the\nsacred dust, uttered some a\ufb00ectionate word, or phrase, or\nsentence. The rich and the poor, the white and the black,\nmingled their tokens of a\ufb00ectionate regard, and dropped\nside by side their tears upon the co\ufb00in. It was humanity\nweeping over the dust of its benefactor.\nOn \nWednesday, \nthe \nday \nof \nthe \nfuneral, \nall \nthe\ndepartments were closed, all public work was suspended,\n\ufb02ags were placed at half-mast, and the public buildings\nwere draped with mourning. The funeral services were held\nin the East Room, which was occupied by the relatives of\nthe deceased (with the exception of Mrs. Lincoln, who was\ntoo \nmuch \nprostrated \nto \nleave \nher \nroom,) \nand \nby\ngovernmental and judicial dignitaries, and such high\no\ufb00icials from the states as had gathered to the capital to\npay their last tribute of respect to the illustrious dead. The\n ceremonies were conducted with great solemnity and\ndignity. The scriptures were read by Rev. Dr. Hale, of the\nEpiscopal church; the opening prayer was made by Bishop\nSimpson, of the Methodist church; the funeral address was\ndelivered by Rev. Dr. Gurley, of the Presbyterian church\nwhich Mr. Lincoln and his family had attended; and the\nclosing prayer was o\ufb00ered by Rev. Dr. Gray, the chaplain of\nthe Senate, and the pastor of a Baptist church. Among\nthose present from the states were Governors Fenton of\nNew York, Andrew of Massachusetts, Parker of New Jersey,\nBrough of Ohio, Oglesby of Illinois, and Buckingham of\nConnecticut. Dr. Gurley\u2019s tribute was a noble one \u2014\nentirely worthy of the occasion. \u201cProbably no man since the\ndays of Washington,\u201d said he, \u201cwas ever so deeply and\n\ufb01rmly imbedded and enshrined in the hearts of the people\nas Abraham Lincoln. Nor was it a mistaken con\ufb01dence and\nlove. He deserved it; deserved it well; deserved it all. He\nmerited it by his character, by his acts, and by the tenor\nand tone and spirit of his life... His integrity was thorough,\nall-pervading, all-controlling and incorruptible.\u201d Speaking\nof the great national emergency in which Mr. Lincoln was\ncalled to power, he said: \u201cHe rose to the dignity and\nmomentousness of the occasion; saw his duty as the chief\nmagistrate of a great and imperiled people; and he\ndetermined to do his duty and his whole duty, seeking the\nguidance, and leaning upon the arm, of Him of whom it is\nwritten\u2014 \u2018He giveth power to the faint, and to them that\nhave no might he increaseth strength.\u2019 Yes, he leaned upon\n His arm. He recognized and received the truth that the\nkingdom is the Lord\u2019s.\u201d\nAt the close of the ceremonies in the White House, the\naugust personages present, and various bodies of civil and\nmilitary \no\ufb00icials, \njoined \nin \nthe \nprocession \nwhich\naccompanied the sacred remains to the Capitol. It was the\nmost impressive procession that ever passed through the\ngrand avenue which leads from the presidential mansion to\nthe Capitol. The avenue was cleared; and every piazza,\nwindow, veranda, and house-top, was \ufb01lled with eager but\nmournful faces. Funereal music \ufb01lled the sweet spring air;\nand this was the only sound, except the measured tread of\nfeet, and the slow roll of wheels upon the pavement. This\nprocession was so long that the head of it had begun to\ndisperse at the Capitol, before the rear had passed the\nTreasury Department. As the hearse, drawn by six gray\nhorses, reached the Capitol grounds, the bands burst forth\nin a requiem, and were answered by minute-guns from the\nforti\ufb01cations. The body of the President was borne into the\nrotunda, \nwhere \nDr. \nGurley \ncompleted \nthe \nreligious\nexercises of the occasion. Here the remains rested, exposed\nto public view, but guarded by soldiery, until the next day.\nThousands who had had no other opportunity to take their\nfarewell of the beloved dust thronged the Capitol all night.\nThe pageant of the day, in many of its aspects, was never\nparalleled upon this continent. Nothing like it \u2014 nothing\napproaching it \u2014 had ever occurred in this country, if\nindeed, in the world.\n While these funeral services and ceremonies were in\nprogress in Washington, similar ceremonies were observed\nin every part of the country. Churches were thrown open,\nwhere prayer and sermon and music united in the\nexpression of a\ufb00ection for the dead, and lamentation for\nthe national loss. Great public gatherings were held, in\nwhich the memory of the good President was celebrated in\nimpulsive speech or studied eulogy. The whole nation\nsuspended its business, and gave itself up to the mournful\nservices and associations of the day. Never had such a\nfuneral been given to a national ruler. Never had died a\nman who received such testimonials of universal a\ufb00ection\nand grief. A whole nation mourned its dead. One thought\nenthralled every heart \u2014 the thought of a great, good man\n\u2014 the father of his people \u2014 cruelly murdered; and all\nanimosities were overwhelmed in the general grief. All\ndetraction was hushed; and every heart that had done him\nwrong, made its amends to his memory, and won peace for\nitself, by awarding to him his just meed of praise.\nAs there was never such a funeral as this, so there was\nnever such a procession. That which moved from the White\nHouse, on the nineteenth, was but the beginning of a\npageant that displayed its marvelous numbers and its ever-\nvarying forms, through country, and village, and city,\nwinding across the territories of vast states, along a track\nof more than \ufb01fteen hundred miles. The President was to\nbe borne back to his own people, and to be buried among\nthe scenes of his early life. He had told the people of\nSpring\ufb01eld, Illinois, when he parted with them, more than\n four years before, that he owed to them all that he was. It\nwas but right that they should have his dust.\nOn the twenty-\ufb01rst, the funeral train left Washington,\namid the silent grief of thousands who had gathered to\nwitness its departure. With the co\ufb00in which contained the\nremains of the President, went back to the western home\nthe co\ufb00in which contained the dust of his beloved Willie,\nwhose death has already been mentioned; and father and\nson, in the touching companionship of death, traveled\ntogether the long journey. At ten o\u2019clock, the train reached\nBaltimore. The immense crowd that had assembled here to\npay their last tribute of respect to the departed President,\nwas full of its suggestions of the change which four years\nhad wrought upon the city. It seemed incredible that this\nwas the city through which the living President had so\nlately passed, in fear of the fate which had at last overtaken\nhim. Nothing that the ingenuity of grief could devise was\nleft undone to make the return passage an imposing\ntestimonial to his memory. The display of military was\nlarge; and all the ceremonies of the occasion were such as\ndid honor, alike to the people of the city, and to the man\nthey mourned. In the afternoon, the train moved for\nHarrisburg, but not until a multitude had improved the\nopportunity to obtain a view of the pale, dead face of their\nfriend. On the way, new mourners were taken on; and at\nevery considerable station people had gathered to see the\nsolemn pageant sweep by. At York, six ladies came into the\ncar, and deposited upon the co\ufb00in an exquisite wreath of\n\ufb02owers, while all who witnessed the a\ufb00ectionate tribute\n were moved to tears. Bells were tolled, and bands breathed\nforth their plaintive music, at every village. The funeral\nobsequies at Harrisburg were observed in the evening.\nUntil midnight, the people crowded into the State Capitol,\nto obtain a view of the remains; and, from seven to nine on\nthe following morning, the catafalque was surrounded by\nthe anxious throngs that had come in from all the country\nround, for the purpose. At this place, as at all the places on\nthe route, there were new pall-bearers, new processions,\nand new expressions of the popular grief. A very large\nprocession accompanied the remains to the cars; and from\nHarrisburg to Philadelphia the funeral train moved through\ncrowds of people, assembled at every convenient point. For\nseveral miles before the train reached Philadelphia, both\nsides of the railway were occupied by almost continuous\nlines of men, women, and children, who stood with\nuncovered heads as the train passed them.\nPhiladelphia was draped with mourning, to give a \ufb01tting\nreception to the honored dead. The streets were \ufb01lled with\npeople, long before the funeral train arrived; and cannon\nthundered forth the announcement of its coming. All that\ningenuity, aided by abundant means, could do, to make the\nfresh pageant a worthy one, was done. A new hearse had\nbeen built, and this was drawn by eight splendid black\nhorses, in silver-mounted harnesses. The procession itself\nwas composed of eleven divisions, and was one of the most\nremarkable, in every respect, with which the remains of the\nPresident were honored during their long passage to their\nresting-place. What place more \ufb01t for the brief sojourn of\n these \nremains \nthan \nIndependence \nHall, \nintimately\nassociated, as it was, with the principles which the sleeping\npatriot had faithfully defended, and still echoing to the ear\nof sorrowing a\ufb00ection with the sound of his living voice? To\nthis hall he was borne, amid the tears of a vast multitude.\nThe hall was literally \ufb01lled with the most exquisite \ufb02owers.\nFrom ten o\u2019clock until midnight, the people had the\nopportunity to view the remains of their beloved chief\nmagistrate. Then the doors were closed; but hundreds\nremained around the building all night, that they might be\n\ufb01rst in the morning. The following day was Sunday, and\nfrom six o\u2019clock in the morning until one o\u2019clock on Monday\nmorning, during which the remains were exposed to view, a\ndense, unbroken stream of men, women, and children,\npressed into and out of the building. The Philadelphia\nInquirer, in its report of the occasion, said: \u201cNever before in\nthe history of our city was such a dense mass of humanity\nhuddled together. Hundreds of persons were seriously\ninjured, from being pressed in the mob; and many fainting\nfemales were extricated by the police and military, and\nconveyed to places of security.\u201d After a person was once in\nthe line, it took from four to \ufb01ve hours to reach the hall. At\none \no\u2019clock, \non \nMonday \nmorning, \nthe \nprocession\nrecommenced its march, bearing the body to Kensington\nStation, which was left at four, for the passage to New York.\nBells were tolled, mottoes were displayed, minute-guns\nwere \ufb01red, and the people were gathered at the various\nstations along the entire passage through New Jersey. It\n seemed as if the whole state had come to the railroad line,\nsimply to witness the passage of the funeral train.\nIt is bewildering to read the accounts of the ceremonies\nat New York, and impracticable to reproduce them. The\npassage of the beloved remains into and through the great\ncity, and the interval of their brief rest while they lay in\nstate in the City Hall, were marked at every stage by some\nnew and impressive expression of the public grief. Minute-\nguns, tolling bells, requiems by choirs of singers, dirges by\nbands of musicians, military and civic displays, suspended\nbusiness, draped \ufb02ags, and shrouded private and public\nbuildings, all mingled their testimony to the universal\nsorrow, and the common wish to do justice and honor to a\nhallowed memory. Every street and avenue around the City\nHall was \ufb01lled with people. The \ufb01rst line formed for\nviewing the remains was three quarters of a mile long, and\nreached far up the Bowery. From the moment when the\nco\ufb00in-lid was removed, until nearly noon on the following\nday, through all the long night, the people pressed into the\nhall, caught a hasty glimpse of the beloved features, and\nthen retired; until it was estimated that one hundred and\n\ufb01fty thousand persons had gained their object, while it was\nevident that twice that number had failed to win the\npatiently awaited vision. The military procession which\naccompanied the remains to the depot of the Hudson River\nRailroad was the most remarkable ever witnessed in the\ncity, numbering fully \ufb01fteen thousand troops. The carriages\nin the procession were \ufb01lled with federal and state\ndignitaries, and representatives of foreign governments in\n full court costume; and the line of the procession was\nthronged from the beginning to the end by crowding\nmultitudes of spectators. The New York Herald\u2019s report\nsays: \u201cThe people, with tearful eyes, under the shadow of\nthe great a\ufb04iction, watched patiently and unmurmuringly\nthe moving of the honored dead and the mournful\nprocession, and silently breathed over them the most\nheartfelt and fervent prayers... Such an occasion, such a\ncrowd, and such a day, New York may never see again.\u201d\nAt a quarter past four, on the afternoon of the twenty-\n\ufb01fth, the train which bore the funeral party from New York\nleft the station, drawn by the \u201cUnion,\u201d the same locomotive\nthat brought Mr. Lincoln to New York, on his passage to\nWashington, more than four years previously. The train\npassed to Albany without stopping, except at Poughkeepsie,\nwhere a delegation from the city government of Albany was\ntaken on board; but the people were gathered at every\npoint to witness the passage. Mottoes were displayed,\ndraped \ufb02ags \ufb02oated everywhere, and all along the route\nstood the silent crowds, with heads uncovered, as the train\nwhich bore the martyred President swept by. It was nearly\nmidnight when Albany was reached; and it was not until\none o\u2019clock, on the morning of the twenty-sixth, that the\nremoval of the co\ufb00in-lid exposed, in the State Capitol, the\nwhite face that so many were anxious to see. From that\ntime until two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, there was a\nconstant throng, the line reaching four deep from the State\nHouse to the foot of State street. It was estimated that\nthere were sixty thousand people in the streets of Albany.\n Here was another great procession; and, at four o\u2019clock in\nthe afternoon, the train started for Bu\ufb00alo. Throughout the\nentire range of large and beautiful towns which the Central\nRailroad threads in its passage from Albany to Bu\ufb00alo, the\nsame demonstrations of grief and respect were witnessed\nwhich had thus far distinguished the homeward journey of\nthe dead President. The reporter of the New York Tribune\nwrote that \u201ca funeral in each house in Central New York\nwould hardly have added solemnity to the day.\u201d\nAt seven o\u2019clock on the morning of the twenty-seventh,\nthe funeral train reached Bu\ufb00alo; and the sacred remains\nwere taken to St. James\u2019 Hall, where, from half-past nine\nuntil eight o\u2019clock in the evening of the next day, they were\nvisited by an immense throng of persons. Bu\ufb00alo had\nalready paid its tribute to Mr. Lincoln\u2019s memory by a large\nprocession on the day of the funeral ceremonies at\nWashington, and omitted the usual pageant on this\noccasion; but a \ufb01ne military escort, accompanied by a\ncrowd of citizens, conducted the remains to the depot in\nthe evening, which was left by the funeral train at ten\no\u2019clock, for the pursuit of the journey to Cleveland. The\ndemonstrations of the popular grief which had been\nwitnessed throughout the journey, were repeated at every\nstation along the route. Not only men, but women and\nchildren were up and wakeful all night, to catch a glimpse\nof the car which bore the precious dust of the beloved\nruler; and, whenever the train stopped, \ufb02owers were\nbrought in and deposited upon the co\ufb00in. At Cleveland,\ngreat preparations were made to receive the President\u2019s\n remains and the funeral party, with be\ufb01tting honors. A\nbuilding for the deposit of the co\ufb00in was erected in the\npark, that the people might have easy access to it. The city\nwas crowded at an early hour, on Friday morning; and on\nevery hand were displayed the symbols of mourning. At\nseven o\u2019clock, the train arrived at the Union depot, amid a\nsalute of artillery; and from this point it was taken back to\nthe Euclid Street station of the Cleveland and Pittsburg\nRailroad, whence the procession moved \u2014 the most\nimposing pageant that this beautiful city on the lake had\never created or witnessed. Bishop McIlvaine, of the diocese\nof Ohio, read the Episcopal burial service on the opening of\nthe co\ufb00in, and o\ufb00ered prayer; after which the long\nprocession \ufb01led through the pavilion, and caught a last\nglimpse of the honored dead. All day long, through falling\nrain, the crowd, unabated in numbers, pressed through the\nlittle building. At ten o\u2019clock at night, one hundred\nthousand people had viewed the remains; and then the\ngates were shut. Soon afterwards, the co\ufb00in was taken\nfrom its beautiful resting-place; and, at twelve o\u2019clock, the\nfuneral party was again in progress, on the way to\nColumbus, the capital of the state.\nBut why repeat the same story again, and again? Why\nsay more than that at Columbus and Indianapolis and\nChicago, as well as at all the intermediate places, men did\nwhat they could, and all that they could, to honor him who\nhad died in their service \u2014 who had been murdered for his\ntruth to them and to freedom? It was a most remarkable\nexhibition of the popular feeling, and is unparalleled in\n history. There was nothing empty, nothing \ufb01ctitious about\nit. There was never a sincerer tribute of a\ufb00ection rendered\nto a man than this. It was a costly one, but men rendered it\ngladly, and hesitated no more at the cost than if they were\nexpressing their grief over the lost members of their own\nhomes.\nIt seemed almost like profanation of the sleeping\nPresident\u2019s rest, to bear him so far, and expose him so\nmuch; but the people demanded it, and would take no\ndenial. All parties, all sects \u2014 friends and foes alike \u2014\nmingled in their a\ufb00ectionate tributes of honor and sorrow.\nWhen the remains of the President reached Chicago,\nthey were at home. They were in the State in which he had\nspent the most of his life; and the people grasped him with\nalmost a sel\ufb01sh sense of ownership. He was theirs. Only a\nshort distance from the spot, lay his old antagonist,\nDouglas, in his last sleep. The party champions were once\nmore near each other, upon their favorite soil; but their\neloquent lips were silent \u2014 silent with an eloquence\nsurpassing sound, in the proclamation of mighty changes in\nthe nation, and the suggestions of mutability and mortality\namong men. One more journey, and the weary form would\nrest. The people of Chicago honored the dead President\nwith emotions that few thus far had experienced. Mr.\nLincoln had been loved and admired by the people of\nIllinois, long before the rest of the nation knew anything\nabout him. His face and voice had been familiar to them for\nmany years; and they had introduced him to the country\nand to immortality. He had walked through the portals of\n the new city into a fame as wide as the world. \u201cHe comes\nback to us,\u201d said the Chicago Tribune, \u201chis work \ufb01nished,\nthe republic vindicated, its enemies overthrown and suing\nfor peace... He left us, asking that the prayers of the people\nmight be o\ufb00ered to Almighty God for wisdom and help to\nsee the right path and pursue it. Those prayers were\nanswered. He accomplished his work, and now the prayers\nof the people ascend for help, to bear the great a\ufb04iction\nwhich has fallen upon them. Slain as no other man has\nbeen slain, cut down while interposing his great charity and\nmercy between the wrath of the people and guilty traitors,\nthe people of Chicago tenderly receive the sacred ashes,\nwith bowed heads and streaming eyes.\u201d\nThe remains reached Spring\ufb01eld on the morning of May\nthird. Throughout the long ride of two hundred miles, over\nthe continuous prairie that lies between Chicago and\nSpring\ufb01eld, there had transpired the most a\ufb00ecting\ndemonstrations of the popular grief. Mottoes, \ufb02ags, minute-\nguns, immense gatherings of the people, music, \ufb02owers,\nand copious tears, testi\ufb01ed the universal sorrow. But in\nSpring\ufb01eld lived the heartiest mourners. Here were his\nintimate and life-long personal friends; and they received\nthe dust of their murdered neighbor and fellow-citizen with\na tenderness of which the people of no other community\nwere capable. The President was forgotten in the\ncompanion and friend, endeared to them by a thousand\nties. The State House, the Lincoln residence, and every\nstore, public building, and dwelling, were draped heavily\nwith mourning \u2014 a manifestation of the public sorrow\n which remained for weeks and months after it had\ndisappeared from all other places that had been passed in\nthe long procession. For twenty-four hours, or until ten\no\u2019clock on the morning of May fourth, the people pressed\ninto the State House, to gain a last glimpse of their\ndeparted friend. Through all the long night of the third, the\nsteady tramp of thousands was heard, winding up the stair-\ncase that led to the Representatives\u2019 Chamber, and passing\nout again. Silently, patiently, sorrowfully, the unfailing\nprocession moved; and it did not stop until the co\ufb00in-lid\nwas shut down, no more to be opened. The procession\nwhich conducted the remains to their \ufb01nal resting-place, in\na tomb prepared for them at Oak Ridge Cemetery, a\nbeautiful spot about two miles from the city, was under the\nimmediate charge of Major-general Joseph Hooker. The\ntown was thronged; and every train that arrived augmented\nthe crowd. A large choir of two hundred and \ufb01fty singers\nsang the familiar hymn, beginning with the words,\n\u201cChildren of the Heavenly King,\u201d\nas the co\ufb00in was borne out to the hearse; and amid the\nsound of solemn dirges and minute-guns the mournful\nprocession moved. The cemetery was occupied by a vast\nmultitude, before the procession arrived; and from hill and\ntree they looked tearfully on, while the co\ufb00in which\ncontained the dust of their friend was consigned to its\nsepulcher. By the side of it was placed the co\ufb00in of \u201clittle\nWillie;\u201d while the living sons, Robert and Thomas, standing\nby the tomb, were objects of an a\ufb00ectionate interest only\nequaled by the deep sorrow for their own and their\n country\u2019s loss. Rev. A. Hale of Spring\ufb01eld opened the\nreligious exercises with prayer; a hymn written for the\noccasion was sung; selections from Scripture, and Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s last Inaugural were read; and Bishop Simpson, a\nfavorite of Mr. Lincoln while living, delivered an eloquent\naddress. Requiems and dirges, sung and played, completed\nthe exercises of the occasion, closing with a benediction by\nRev. Dr. Gurley of Washington.\nThe address of Bishop Simpson, able, a\ufb00ectionate, and\nexcellent as it was, contained nothing more notable than\nthe quotation that the speaker made from one of Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s speeches, uttered in , in which, speaking of\nthe slave power, he said: \u201cBroken by it I, too, may be, bow\nto it, I never will. The probability that we may fail in the\nstruggle, ought not to deter us from the support of a cause\nwhich I deem to be just; and it shall not deter me. If ever I\nfeel the soul within me elevate and expand to those\ndimensions not wholly unworthy of its Almighty Architect, it\nis when I contemplate the cause of my country, deserted by\nall the world besides, and I, standing up boldly and alone,\nand hurling de\ufb01ance at her victorious oppressors. Here,\nwithout contemplating consequences, before high Heaven\nand in the face of the world, I swear eternal \ufb01delity to the\njust cause, as I deem it, of the land of my life, my liberty\nand my love.\u201d No inspiration \ufb01ner than this breathes in any\nof Mr. Lincoln\u2019s utterances. It almost seems as if an\nintimation of his life and death were given to him at the\nmoment \u2014 as if a glimpse into his own and his country\u2019s\nfuture had been vouchsafed to his excited vision.\n The crowd slowly separated; the citizens moved back to\ntheir homes; those who had accompanied the precious\nremains \u2014 at last resting, and in safe and a\ufb00ectionate\nkeeping \u2014 from Washington and points along the route,\ntook their departure by the out-going trains; the guard\npaced their little round before the tomb, where through the\ngrate the large and the little co\ufb00in lay in the dim light; and\nthe people of Spring\ufb01eld were left to their grief and their\nglory.\nThere, surrounded by the sweetest scenes of nature, his\ntomb a shrine, his name the watchword of liberty, his fame\nin the a\ufb00ectionate keeping of mankind, his memory\nhallowed by martyrdom for the humane and Christian\nprinciples to which his life was devoted, the weary patriot\nrests. His sun went down suddenly, and whelmed the\ncountry in a darkness which was felt by every heart; but far\nup the clouds sprang soon the golden twilight, \ufb02ooding the\nheavens with radiance, and illuminating every uncovered\nbrow with the hope of a fair to-morrow. The aching head,\nthe shattered nerves, the anxious heart, the weary frame,\nare all at rest; and the noble spirit that informed them,\nbows reverently and humbly in the presence of Him in\nwhom it trusted, and to whose work it devoted the troubled\nyears of its earthly life.\nThe death of Mr. Lincoln wrought great change in the\nfeelings of all the representatives of foreign opinion, not\nonly toward him, but toward the country and its cause; and\nmany were the testimonials that came in every ship, of\nforeign sympathy with the nation in its bereavement and\n with those whose family life had been so cruelly dissolved\nby the deed of the assassin. The British Queen wrote to\nMrs. Lincoln a letter of condolence, with her own hand. All\nthe foreign governments took occasion to express their\nhorror at the crime which had deprived the nation of its\nhead, and their sympathy with the people thus suddenly\nand violently bereft. The London Times, which had always\nbeen unjust to Mr. Lincoln, said: \u201cIt would be unjust not to\nacknowledge that Mr. Lincoln was a man who could not,\nunder any circumstances, have been easily replaced.\u201d\nFurther on in its article, it confessed that \u201cEnglishmen\nlearned \nto \nrespect \na \nman \nwho \nshowed \nthe \nbest\ncharacteristics of their race, in his respect for what is good\nin the past, acting in unison with a recognition of what was\nmade necessary by the events of passing history.\u201d The\nLondon Star said: \u201cIt can never be forgotten, while history\nis read, that the hands of southern partisans have been\nreddened by the foulest assassin-plot the world has ever\nknown; that they have been treacherously dipped in the\nblood of one of the best citizens and purest patriots to\nwhom the land of Washington gave birth.\u201d The London\nSpectator spoke of Mr. Lincoln as \u201cthe noblest President\nwhom America has had since the time of Washington;\u201d and\n\u201ccertainly the best, if not the ablest, man ruling over any\ncountry in the civilized world.\u201d The London Saturday\nReview said: \u201cDuring the arduous experience of four years,\nMr. Lincoln constantly rose in general estimation, by\ncalmness of temper, by an intuitively logical appreciation of\nthe character of the con\ufb02ict, and by undisputed sincerity.\u201d\n The Economist said, \u201cThe murder of Mr. Lincoln is a very\ngreat and very lamentable event \u2014 perhaps the greatest\nand most lamentable which has occurred since the Coup\nd\u2019etat, if not since Waterloo. It a\ufb00ects directly and\nimmensely the welfare of the three most powerful countries\nin the world, \u2014 America, France and England, \u2014 and it\na\ufb00ects them all for evil.\u201d Goldwin Smith, in Macmillan\u2019s\nMagazine, said: \u201cHe (Mr. Lincoln) professed to wait on\nevents, or, rather, on the manifestations of the moral forces\naround him, wherein, with a mind sobered by responsibility\nand unclouded by sel\ufb01shness, he earnestly endeavored to\nread the will of God, which, having read it, he patiently\nfollowed to the best of his power. In him, his nation has\nlost, not a king, or a prophet, \u2014 not a creative moulder of\nits destinies, or an inspired unfolder of its future, \u2014 but\nsimply a sensible interpreter, and a wise, temperate, honest\nexecutor of its own better mind.\u201d\nEven these expressions of the British press do not\nindicate the popular feeling with which the English people\nreceived the announcement of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s assassination.\nThe excitement which \ufb01lled the public mind, on the\nreception of the startling tidings, in all the great cities and\nconsiderable towns of England, was only equaled by that\nwhich swept over those of our own country. It was hard to\ntell whether horror at the crime or grief for its victim was\nthe predominant emotion of the British people. Men who\napplauded the deed, were kicked out of assemblies in\nLondon, as they were in New York. The digni\ufb01ed Mr.\nMason, the rebel commissioner, was boldly condemned for\n an attempt to extenuate the crime on the ground that it was\na natural incident of civil war.\nAt home, the change of feeling was hardly less marked\nand gratifying. Presses that had done Mr. Lincoln injustice\nthroughout his whole career, made haste to lay their tribute\nof respectful praise upon his bier. Men who had cursed him,\njoined tearfully in the processions which attended his long\njourney homeward. Even from the depths of the dead\nrebellion, there came honest lamentations, and sincere\npraises. The eyes of his \u201cblinded fellow countrymen,\u201d which\nhe so ardently desired to open, were unsealed at last, to\nbehold, in the man they had so long regarded with hatred\nor contempt, the friend they had always possessed, and the\nbenefactor they sorely needed, but had lost forever.\nAndrew Johnson, the Vice-president, became, under the\nprovisions of the Constitution, the President of the United\nStates, by taking the oath of o\ufb00ice, on the morning of the\nmurder. The people who had battled for the Constitution\nand the laws so long, did not dream of a resort to any other\ncourse. The speculations of a portion of the foreign press,\nconcerning \nthis \nevent, \nshowed \nhow \nunworthy \nand\ninadequate still was the estimate of the American people\nand their institutions. There was not a hand lifted, or a\nword uttered, to question or dispute the step which\ninstalled a new President over the republic; and there was\nnot, in a single American heart, a doubt as to the result.\nThere was no panic, no excitement, no danger, no disaster;\nbut the country kept to its groove, and felt no jar as it slid\ninto the new administration.\n The world could not conceal Mr. Lincoln\u2019s murderer. It\nhad no waste so wide, no cavern so deep, as to give him a\nsafe hiding-place. That was evident to everybody; and\nwould have been foreseen by himself, had he not been\nstulti\ufb01ed by his greed for blood. Large rewards were\no\ufb00ered for his apprehension, and military and police were\nquickly on the alert. After a few days of doubt, it became\nevident that Booth, with a companion, had passed over the\nNavy Yard Bridge, which crosses the eastern branch of the\nPotomac. It was known that the assassin had been in the\nhabit of spending much time in Charles County, Maryland,\nand had been in correspondence with the disloyal people\nthere. It afterwards appeared that Booth, accompanied by\nDavid C. Harold, rode all night after the commission of the\nmurder; and that near Bogantown he called on one Dr.\nMudd, to have his leg dressed, which had been fractured by\nhis leap upon the stage, at the time he committed the\nmurder. The detectives, reaching this region, and hearing\nthat Dr. Mudd had received the visit of two suspicious\nstrangers, arrested him and all his family. From this point,\nBooth and his accomplice were tracked toward the\nPotomac. The ru\ufb00ians were undoubtedly aided in their\nprogress by disloyal citizens, for the o\ufb00icers were\nfrequently not more than an hour behind them. Although\ngunboats were patrolling the river, the murderer and his\naccomplice crossed the Potomac under cover of darkness.\nIt was soon afterwards ascertained where they had\ncrossed, and the cavalry started in pursuit. The men were\nfound at last in a barn belonging to William Garratt. The\n building was surrounded, and Booth was called upon to\nsurrender himself. He \ufb02atly refused to do so. Harold was\nready to surrender, but Booth cursed him for a coward; and\ndeclared to Colonel Baker, at the head of the force, that he\nwould not be taken alive. The barn was \ufb01red, and Booth\nattempted to extinguish the \ufb02ame, but failed. Harold then\ngave himself up, while the murderer remained, displaying\nall the qualities of the hardened desperado. Sergeant\nBoston Corbett, moved by a sudden impulse, drew up his\npistol, and \ufb01red upon Booth, who was seen standing in the\nbarn, with a revolver in each hand; and planted a ball in his\nneck, which passed entirely through his head. He died\nwithin less than three hours, sending to his mother a\nmessage to the e\ufb00ect that he had died for his country, and\nexhibiting no penitence whatever for the terrible deed he\nhad committed. He was shot on the twenty-sixth of April,\ntwelve days after the murder. His body was taken back to\nWashington, and was buried, no one save those to whom\nthe task of sepulture was assigned having any knowledge of\nits place of burial. Harold was committed to prison to await\nhis trial.\nJohn Wilkes Booth was the son of the famous actor,\nJunius Brutus Booth, and had attained some celebrity in his\nfather\u2019s profession. He was an exceedingly handsome man;\nbut he had been notoriously and grossly pro\ufb02igate and\nimmoral in his habits. Still, his gifts and his beauty had\nmade him a favorite in certain nominally respectable social\ncircles. \nHis \nsympathy \nwith \nthe \nrebellion \nwas \nwell\nunderstood in Washington, but he was never regarded as a\n dangerous man. That he committed the crime which cost\nhim his life from any romantic love of the South, or from\nany desire to avenge the South for fancied wrongs, is not\nprobable. The deed seems to have been the o\ufb00spring of a\nmorbid desire for immortality. He had given frequent hints,\nin his conversation, of the miserable passion which\npossessed him; and there is no doubt that he had worked\nhimself into a belief that he should rid the world of a tyrant\nby murdering the President, and thus link his name with a\nstartling deed which, in the future, would be admired as a\nglorious act of heroism. Certainly his deed was one of\nwonderful boldness; and the bravery which he exhibited at\nhis capture was worthy of a better cause and a better man.\nFortunately, no fatal wounds were in\ufb02icted upon Mr.\nSeward in Payne\u2019s attempt upon his life, or upon any of\nthose who were subjects of violence at that ru\ufb00ian\u2019s hands.\nThe Secretary and his son, Mr. Frederick Seward, were\ndesperately wounded; but, under skillful surgical care, they\nentirely recovered. Payne was arrested, and, with his fellow\nconspirators \u2014 David E. Harold (who was captured with\nBooth,) George A. Atzerodt, Michael O\u2019Laughlin, Edward\nSpangler (who held Booth\u2019s horse at the theater, and aided\nhis escape,) Samuel Arnold, Mary E. Surratt and Dr.\nSamuel Mudd \u2014 was tried by a military commission. The\nconspiracy contemplated not only the murder of Mr.\nLincoln and Mr. Seward, but that of Vice-president Johnson\nand Lieutenant-general Grant. Booth alone accomplished\nhis task. Payne made a desperate e\ufb00ort, \u2014 such as only a\nman of his great physical strength could make; but failed.\n Atzerodt, to whose hands the murder of the Vice-president\nwas committed, was not competent, morally or physically,\nto the task he undertook; while General Grant escaped the\nprojected attempt upon his life by leaving the city. Harold,\nAtzerodt, Payne and Mrs. Surratt, the latter of whom aided\nand abetted the plot, were sentenced to be hanged; and\nthey su\ufb00ered the penalty of their crimes on the seventh day\nof July. Dr. Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O\u2019Laughlin\nwere sentenced to hard labor for life, and were consigned\nto the Dry Tortugas. Edward Spangler accompanied them,\nsentenced to hard labor for six years.\nThe writer cannot bid farewell to the reader, and to the\nillustrious subject of this biography, without a closing\ntribute \nto \na \ncharacter \nunique \nin \nhistory, \nand \nan\nadministration that stands alone in the annals of the nation.\nWe have seen one of the humblest of American citizens\nstruggling through personal trials and national turmoils,\ninto the light of universal fame, and an assured immortality\nof renown. We have seen him become the object of warm\nand devoted a\ufb00ection to a whole nation. We have witnessed\nsuch manifestations of grief at his loss as the death of no\nruler has called forth, within the memory of man. We have\nseen a great popular government, poisoned in every\ndepartment by the virus of treason, and blindly and feebly\ntottering to its death, restored to health and soundness\nthrough the bene\ufb01cent ministry of this true man, who left it\nwith vigor in its veins, irresistible strength in its arms, the\n\ufb01re of exultation and hope in its eyes, and with such power\nand majesty in its step, that the earth shook beneath its\n stately goings. We have seen four millions of African\nbondmen who, groaning in helpless slavery when he\nreceived the crown of power, became freemen by his word\nbefore death struck that crown from his brow. We have\nseen the enemies of his country vanquished and suing for\npardon; and the sneering nations of the world, whose\nincontinent contempt and spite were poured in upon him\nduring the \ufb01rst years of his administration, becoming \ufb01rst\nsilent, then respectful, and then unstinted in their\nadmiration and approbation.\nThese marvelous changes in public feeling, and the\nrevolutions imbodied in these wonderful results, were not\nthe work of a mighty genius, sitting above the nation, and\nordering its a\ufb00airs. That Mr. Lincoln was much more than\nan ordinary man, in intellectual power, is su\ufb00iciently\nevident; but it was not by intellectual power that he\nwrought out the grand results of his life. These were rather\nthe work of the heart, than the head. With no wish to\ndepreciate the motives or undervalue the names of Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s predecessors in o\ufb00ice, it may be declared that\nnever, in the history of the government, have the a\ufb00airs of\nthat o\ufb00ice been administered with such direct reference to\nthe will of God, and the everlasting principles of\nrighteousness and justice, as they were during his\nadministration. It was eminently a Christian administration\n\u2014 one which, in its policy and acts, expressed the\nconvictions of a Christian people. Standing above the loose\nmorality of party politics, standing above the maxims and\nconventionalisms of statesmanship, leaving aside all the\n indirections and insincerities of diplomacy, trusting the\npeople, leaning upon the people, inspired by the people,\nwho in their Christian homes and Christian sanctuaries\ngave it their con\ufb01dence, this administration of Abraham\nLincoln stands out in history as the \ufb01nest exhibition of a\nChristian democracy the world has ever seen. The power of\na true-hearted Christian man, in perfect sympathy with a\ntrue-hearted Christian people, was Mr. Lincoln\u2019s power.\nOpen on one side of his nature to all descending in\ufb02uences\nfrom Him to whom he prayed, and open on the other to all\nascending in\ufb02uences from the people whom he served, he\naimed simply to do his duty, to God and men. Acting rightly,\nhe acted greatly. While he took care of deeds, fashioned by\na purely ideal standard, God took care of results. Moderate,\nfrank, truthful, gentle, forgiving, loving, just, Mr. Lincoln\nwill always be remembered as eminently a Christian\nPresident; and the almost immeasurably great results\nwhich he had the privilege of achieving, were due to the\nfact that he was a Christian President.\nConscience, \nand \nnot \nexpediency, \nnot \ntemporary\nadvantage, not popular applause, not the love of power, was\nthe ruling and guiding motive of his life. He was\nconscientious in his devotion to the Constitution and the\nlaws. In this he was in advance of his people, and in\nadvance of a multitude of his own friends. With every\nconstitutional right, he dealt tenderly and carefully, while\ntaunted by his own friends with subserviency to an\ninstitution which, in his inmost soul, he hated. His respect\nfor law was as profound and sincere as his respect for God\n and his will. Unin\ufb02uenced by popular clamor, and unbent\nby his own humane and Christian desire to see all men free,\nhe did not speak the word of emancipation until his duty to\nthe Constitution which he had sworn to protect and defend\ndemanded it. There is no doubt that, if he could have saved\nthe country without destroying slavery, he would have done\nit, and done it against the most ardent wishes of his heart,\nthrough his regard for the Constitution which protected the\ninhuman institution, and the oath by which he had been\ninvested with power. It was not slowness, nor coldness, nor\nindi\ufb00erence, that delayed the emancipation of the slaves. It\nwas loyal, devoted, self-denying virtue.\nMr. Lincoln was conscientious in his patience. He knew\nand felt the weakness of human nature, and appreciated\nthe force of education in moulding character and opinion.\nHence, he was patient with his enemies, and equally\npatient with equally unreasonable friends. No hasty act of\nhis administration can be traced to his impatience. When\nsuch an act was performed, and was followed by its\ninevitable consequences of evil, it originated in the\nimpatience of those whom he could not control. His steps\nwere taken with the deliberateness of destiny; and, as these\nsteps are retraced by the historian, he can compare them\nto nothing but those leisurely and irresistible proceedings\nby which the Great Father in whom the good President\ntrusted had wrought out his will in creation and\nProvidence. Step by step, hand in hand with events, he\nworked and waited patiently, for the great consummation to\nwhich all the e\ufb00orts of his life were devoted. Maligned,\n misunderstood, abused, cursed, his motives the foot-balls of\nmalice and envy and pride and foolishness, he waited\npatiently for history to vindicate him, and permitted no\nsmarting sense of personal injustice to divert him from his\nduty to his country.\nHe was conscientious in his regard for human rights. His\nopposition to slavery, and his love of the African, were no\nmere matters of policy, or means for winning power. He had\na tender, brotherly regard for every human being; and the\nthought of oppression was a torment to him. There was\nnothing that moved him to such indignation as a wrong\ncommitted against the helpless ones of his own kind. He\nbelieved that negroes were men, endowed by their Creator\nwith the rights of men; and, thus believing, there was no\nmanly privilege which he enjoyed, that he would not have\nbeen glad to see conferred upon them. Hence, had he lived,\nhe would logically have numbered himself among those\nwho will agitate the right of universal loyal su\ufb00rage until\nthat right shall be secured to every loyal man living under\nthe American \ufb02ag.\nIn Mr. Lincoln\u2019s life and character, the American people\nhave received a benefaction not less in permanent\nimportance and value, than in the revolution in opinion and\npolicy by which he introduced them to a new national life.\nHe has given them a statesman without a statesman\u2019s\ncraftiness, a politician without a politician\u2019s meannesses, a\ngreat man without a great man\u2019s vices, a philanthropist\nwithout \na \nphilanthropist\u2019s \nimpracticable \ndreams; \na\nChristian without pretensions, a ruler without the pride of\n place and power, an ambitious man without sel\ufb01shness, and\na successful man without vanity. On the basis of such a\nmanhood as this, all the coming generations of the nation\nwill not fail to build high and beautiful ideals of human\nexcellence, whose attractive power shall raise to a nobler\nlevel the moral sense and moral character of the nation.\nThis true manhood \u2014 simple, unpretending, sympathetic\nwith all humanity, and reverent toward God \u2014 is among the\nnoblest of the nation\u2019s treasures; and through it, God has\nbreathed, and will continue to breathe, into the nation, the\nelevating and purifying power of his own divine life.\nHumble child of the backwoods \u2014 boatman, ax-man,\nhired laborer, clerk, surveyor, captain, legislator, lawyer,\ndebater, orator, politician, statesman, President, savior of\nthe republic, emancipator of a race, true Christian, true\nman \u2014 we receive thy life and its immeasurably great\nresults, as the choicest gifts that a mortal has ever\nbestowed upon us; grateful to thee for thy truth to thyself,\nto us, and to God; and grateful to that ministry of\nProvidence and grace which endowed thee so richly, and\nbestowed thee upon the nation and mankind.\n",
    "1862-1869": "   ha ter   I.\nAND NOW BEGAN a new life, so unlike anything that Mr.\nLincoln had hitherto experienced that he found himself\naltogether a\ufb02oat as to the proprieties of his position. His\nnomination had not elevated or elated him; and he did not\nsee why it should change his manners or his bearing\ntoward anybody. He had been diminished in his own\nestimation \u2014 in some respects humbled and oppressed \u2014\nby the great responsibilities placed upon him, rather than\nmade important and great. He was the people\u2019s instrument,\nthe people\u2019s servant, the people\u2019s creation. He could put on\nnone of the airs of eminence; he could place no bars\nbetween himself and those who had honored him. None of\nhis old heartiness and simplicity left him. Men who entered\nhis house impressed with a sense of his new dignities,\nfound him the same honest, a\ufb00ectionate, true-hearted and\nsimple-minded Abraham Lincoln that he had always been.\nHe answered his own bell, accompanied his visitors to the\ndoor when they retired, and felt all that interfered with his\nold homely and hearty habits of hospitality as a burden \u2014\nalmost an impertinence.\nFrom this moment to the moment of his death he knew\nnothing of leisure. He was astonished to \ufb01nd how many\nfriends he had. They thronged his house from every quarter\nof the country. Probably no candidate for presidential\n honors was ever so beset by place-seekers and lion-hunters\nas was Mr. Lincoln; for it is rare indeed that any man is\nnominated for the presidency with the same moral\ncertainty of an election which attached to his prospects. It\nwas almost universally believed, both at the North and the\nSouth, that he would be elected; and he was treated like a\nman who already had the reins of power in his hands.\nSome of his friends who had witnessed his laborious way\nof receiving and dismissing his guests and visitors\ninterposed with \u201cThomas,\u201d a colored servant who became\nvery useful to him; but it was very hard and very unnatural\nfor him to yield to another, and he a servant, the ministry of\nthe courtesies which it was so much his delight to render;\nand he not unfrequently broke over the rules which his\nconsiderate advisers undertook to impose upon him. One\nthing was remarkable in these receptions \u2014 his attention to\nthe humble and the poor. No poor, humble, scared man\never came into his house toward whom his heart did not at\nonce go out with a gush of noble sympathy. To these he was\nalways particularly attentive, and they were placed at ease\nat once. He took pains to show them that no change of\ncircumstance could make him forget his early condition, or\nalienate his heart from those with whom he had shared the\nhardships and humilities of obscurity and poverty.\nThe interruption of family privacy and comfort by the\nconstant throng of visitors at last became intolerable, and it\nwas determined that Mr. Lincoln should hold his receptions\nelsewhere. Accordingly the Executive Chamber, a large \ufb01ne\nroom in the State House, was set apart for him; and in this\n room he met the public until, after his election, he departed\nfor Washington. Here he met the millionaire and the\nmenial, the priest and the politician, men, women and\nchildren, old friends and new friends, those who called for\nlove and those who sought for o\ufb00ice. From morning until\nnight this was his business; and he performed it with\nconscientious care and the most unwearying patience.\nAs illustrative of the nature of many of his calls, a brace\nof incidents may be recorded as they were related to the\nwriter by an eye-witness. Mr. Lincoln being seated in\nconversation with a gentleman one day, two raw, plainly\ndressed young \u201cSuckers\u201d entered the room, and bashfully\nlingered near the door. As soon as he observed them, and\napprehended their embarrassment, he rose and walked to\nthem, saying, \u201cHow do you do, my good fellows? What can I\ndo for you? Will you sit down?\u201d The spokesman of the pair,\nthe shorter of the two, declined to sit, and explained the\nobject of the call thus: he had had a talk about the relative\nhight of Mr. Lincoln and his companion, and had asserted\nhis belief that they were of exactly the same hight. He had\ncome in to verify his judgment. Mr. Lincoln smiled, went\nand got his cane, and, placing the end of it upon the wall,\nsaid, \u201chere, young man, come under here.\u201d The young man\ncame under the cane, as Mr. Lincoln held it, and when it\nwas perfectly adjusted to his hight, Mr. Lincoln said: \u201cnow\ncome out and hold up the cane.\u201d This he did while Mr.\nLincoln stepped under. Rubbing his head back and forth to\nsee that it worked easily under the measurement, he\nstepped out, and declared to the sagacious fellow who was\n curiously looking on, that he had guessed with remarkable\naccuracy \u2014 that he and the young man were exactly of the\nsame hight. Then he shook hands with them and sent them\non their way. Mr. Lincoln would just as soon have thought\nof cutting o\ufb00 his right hand as he would have thought of\nturning those boys away with the impression that they had\nin any way insulted his dignity.\nThey had hardly disappeared when an old and modestly\ndressed woman made her appearance. She knew Mr.\nLincoln, but Mr. Lincoln did not at \ufb01rst recognize her. Then\nshe undertook to recall to his memory certain incidents\nconnected with his rides upon the circuit \u2014 especially his\ndining at her house upon the road at di\ufb00erent times. Then\nhe remembered her and her home. Having \ufb01xed her own\nplace in his recollection; she tried to recall to him a certain\nscanty dinner of bread and milk that he once ate at her\nhouse. He could not remember it \u2014 on the contrary, he only\nremembered that he had always fared well at her house.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said she, \u201cone day you came along after we had got\nthrough dinner, and we had eaten up everything, and I\ncould give you nothing but a bowl of bread and milk; and\nyou ate it; and when you got up you said it was good\nenough for the President of the United States.\u201d The good\nold woman, remembering the remark, had come in from the\ncountry, making a journey of eight or ten miles, to relate to\nMr. Lincoln this incident, which, in her mind, had doubtless\ntaken the form of prophesy. Mr. Lincoln placed the honest\ncreature at her ease, chatted with her of old times, and\n dismissed her in the most happy and complacent frame of\nmind.\nThe interviews of this character were almost numberless,\nconstantly intermingled with grave conversations with\nstatesmen and politicians concerning the campaign in\nprogress, and the condition and prospects of the country.\nThe future was very dark. Threats of secession grew louder\nand deeper. Steps towards treason were bolder with every\npassing day. He knew the spirit of slavery. He had\nmeasured it in all the length and breadth of its malignity\nand treachery. He felt that he was entering upon a path full\nof danger, overshadowed all the way with doubt and fear.\nWith this great care upon him \u2014 with the burden of a\nnation already taken upon his shoulders \u2014 he was often\nbowed down with the deepest despondency. He believed in\nhis inmost soul that he was an instrument in the hands of\nGod for the accomplishment of a great purpose. The power\nwas above him, the workers were around him, the end was\nbeyond him. In him, Providence, the people and the\npurpose of both met; and as a poor, weak, imperfect man,\nhe felt humbled by the august presence, and crushed by the\nimportance with which he had been endowed.\nOf one thing Mr. Lincoln felt sure: that in the great\nstruggle before him he ought to be supported by the\nChristian sentiment and the Christian in\ufb02uence of the\nnation. Nothing pained him more than the thought that a\nman professing the religion of Jesus Christ, and especially a\nman who taught the religion of Jesus Christ, should be\nopposed to him. He felt that every religious man \u2014 every\n man who believed in God, in the principles of everlasting\njustice, in truth and righteousness \u2014 should be opposed to\nslavery, and should support and assist him in the struggle\nagainst inhumanity and oppression which he felt to be\nimminent. It was to him a great mystery how those who\npreached the gospel to the poor, and who, by their Divine\nMaster, were sent to heal the broken-hearted, to preach\ndeliverance to the captives, and to set at liberty those that\nwere bruised, could be his opponents and enemies.\nMr. \nNewton \nBateman, \nSuperintendent \nof \nPublic\nInstruction for the State of Illinois, occupied a room\nadjoining and opening into the Executive Chamber.\nFrequently this door was open during Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nreceptions; and throughout the seven months or more of\nhis occupation Mr. Bateman saw him nearly every day.\nOften when Mr. Lincoln was tired he closed his door\nagainst all intrusion, and called Mr. Bateman into his room\nfor a quiet talk. On one of these occasions Mr. Lincoln took\nup a book containing a careful canvass of the city of\nSpring\ufb01eld in which he lived, showing the candidate for\nwhom each citizen had declared it his intention to vote in\nthe approaching election. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s friends had,\ndoubtless at his own request, placed the result of the\ncanvass in his hands. This was toward the close of October,\nand only a few days before the election. Calling Mr.\nBateman to a seat at his side, having previously locked all\nthe doors, he said: \u201clet us look over this book. I wish\nparticularly to see how the ministers of Spring\ufb01eld are\ngoing to vote.\u201d The leaves were turned, one by one, and as\n the names were examined Mr. Lincoln frequently asked if\nthis one and that were not a minister, or an elder, or the\nmember of such or such a church, and sadly expressed his\nsurprise on receiving an a\ufb00irmative answer. In that manner\nthey went through the book, and then he closed it and sat\nsilently and for some minutes regarding a memorandum in\npencil which lay before him. At length he turned to Mr.\nBateman with a face full of sadness, and said: \u201cHere are\ntwenty-three ministers, of di\ufb00erent denominations, and all\nof them are against me but three; and here are a great\nmany prominent members of the churches, a very large\nmajority of whom are against me. Mr. Bateman, I am not a\nChristian \u2014 God knows I would be one \u2014 but I have\ncarefully read the Bible, and I do not so understand this\nbook;\u201d and he drew from his bosom a pocket New\nTestament. \u201cThese men well know,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat I\nam for freedom in the territories, freedom everywhere as\nfar as the Constitution and laws will permit, and that my\nopponents are for slavery. They know this, and yet, with\nthis book in their hands, in the light of which human\nbondage cannot live a moment, they are going to vote\nagainst me. I do not understand it at all.\u201d\nHere Mr. Lincoln paused \u2014 paused for long minutes, his\nfeatures surcharged with emotion. Then he rose and\nwalked up and down the room in the e\ufb00ort to retain or\nregain his self-possession. Stopping at last, he said, with a\ntrembling voice and his cheeks wet with tears: \u201cI know\nthere is a God, and that He hates injustice and slavery. I see\nthe storm coming, and I know that His hand is in it. If He\n has a place and work for me \u2014 and I think He has \u2014 I\nbelieve I am ready. I am nothing, but truth is everything. I\nknow I am right because I know that liberty is right, for\nChrist teaches it, and Christ is God. I have told them that a\nhouse divided against itself cannot stand, and Christ and\nreason say the same; and they will \ufb01nd it so. Douglas don\u2019t\ncare whether slavery is voted up or voted down, but God\ncares, and humanity cares, and I care; and with God\u2019s help\nI shall not fail. I may not see the end; but it will come, and I\nshall be vindicated; and these men will \ufb01nd that they have\nnot read their Bibles aright.\u201d\nMuch of this was uttered as if he were speaking to\nhimself; and with a sad and earnest solemnity of manner\nimpossible to be described. After a pause, he resumed:\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it appear strange that men can ignore the moral\naspects of this contest? A revelation could not make it\nplainer to me that slavery or the government must be\ndestroyed. The future would be something awful, as I look\nat it, but for this rock on which I stand\u201d (alluding to the\nTestament which he still held in his hand,) \u201cespecially with\nthe knowledge of how these ministers are going to vote. It\nseems as if God had borne with this thing (slavery) until the\nvery teachers of religion have come to defend it from the\nBible, and to claim for it a divine character and sanction;\nand now the cup of iniquity is full, and the vials of wrath\nwill be poured out.\u201d\nHis last reference was to certain prominent clergymen in\nthe South, Drs. Ross and Palmer among the number; and he\nwent on to comment on the atrociousness and essential\n blasphemy of their attempts to defend American slavery\nfrom the Bible. After this the conversation was continued\nfor a long time. Everything he said was of a peculiarly\ndeep, tender and religious tone, and all was tinged with a\ntouching melancholy. He repeatedly referred to his\nconviction that the day of wrath was at hand, and that he\nwas to be an actor in the terrible struggle which would\nissue in the overthrow of slavery, though he might not live\nto see the end. He repeated many passages of the Bible,\nand seemed especially impressed with the solemn grandeur\nof portions of Revelation, describing the wrath of Almighty\nGod. In the course of the conversation, he dwelt much upon\nthe necessity of faith in the Christian\u2019s God, as an element\nof successful statesmanship, especially in times like those\nwhich were upon him, and said that it gave that calmness\nand tranquillity of mind, that assurance of ultimate success,\nwhich made a man \ufb01rm and immovable amid the wildest\nexcitements. After further reference to a belief in Divine\nProvidence, and the fact of God in history, the conversation\nturned upon prayer. He freely stated his belief in the duty,\nprivilege and e\ufb00icacy of prayer, and intimated, in no\nunmistakable terms, that he had sought in that way the\ndivine guidance and favor.\nThe e\ufb00ect of this conversation upon the mind of Mr.\nBateman, a Christian gentleman whom Mr. Lincoln\nprofoundly respected, was to convince him, that Mr.\nLincoln had, in his quiet way, found a path to the Christian\nstand-point \u2014 that he had found God, and rested on the\neternal truth of God. As the two men were about to\n separate, Mr. Bateman remarked: \u201cI have not supposed that\nyou were accustomed to think so much upon this class of\nsubjects. Certainly your friends generally are ignorant of\nthe sentiments you have expressed to me.\u201d He replied\nquickly: \u201cI know they are. I am obliged to appear di\ufb00erent\nto them; but I think more on these subjects than upon all\nothers, and I have done so for years; and I am willing that\nyou should know it.\u201d\nThis remarkable conversation furnished a golden link in\nthe chain of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s history. It \ufb02ashes a strong light\nupon the path he had already trod, and illuminates every\npage of his subsequent record. Men have wondered at his\nabounding charity, his love of men, his equanimity under\nthe most distressing circumstances, his patience under\ninsult and misrepresentation, his delicate consideration of\nthe feelings of the humble, his apparent incapacity of\nresentment, his love of justice, his transparent simplicity,\nhis truthfulness, his good will toward his enemies, his\nbeautiful and unshaken faith in the triumph of the right.\nThere \nwas \nundoubtedly \nsomething \nin \nhis \nnatural\nconstitution \nthat \nfavored \nthe \ndevelopment \nof \nthese\nqualities; but those best acquainted with human nature will\nhardly attribute the combination of excellencies which were\nexhibited in his character and life to the unaided forces of\nhis constitution. The man who carried what he called \u201cthis\nrock\u201d in his bosom, who prayed, who thought more of\nreligious subjects than of all others, who had an undying\nfaith in the providence of God, drew his life from the\nhighest fountains.\n It was one of the peculiarities of Mr. Lincoln to hide\nthese religious experiences from the eyes of the world. In\nthe same State House where this conversion occurred,\nthere were men who imagined \u2014 really believed \u2014 who\nfreely said \u2014 that Mr. Lincoln had probably revealed\nhimself with less restraint to them than to others \u2014 men\nwho thought they knew him as they knew their bosom\ncompanions \u2014 who had never in their whole lives heard\nfrom his lips one word of all these religious convictions and\nexperiences. They did not regard him as a religious man.\nThey had never seen anything but the active lawyer, the\nkeen politician, the jovial, fun-loving companion, in Mr.\nLincoln. All this department of his life he had kept carefully\nhidden from them. Why he should say that he was obliged\nto appear di\ufb00erently to others does not appear; but the fact\nis a matter of history that he never exposed his own\nreligious life to those who had no sympathy with it. It is\ndoubtful whether the clergymen of Spring\ufb01eld knew\nanything of these experiences. Very few of them were in\npolitical sympathy with him; and it is evident that he could\nopen his heart to no one except under the most favorable\ncircumstances. The fountain from which gushed up so\ngrand and good a life was kept carefully covered from the\neyes of the world. Its possessor looked into it often, but the\ncareless or curious crowd were never favored with the\nvision. There was much in his conduct that was simply a\ncover to these thoughts \u2014 an attempt to conceal them. It is\nmore than probable that, on separating with Mr. Bateman\non this occasion, he met some old friend, and, departing by\n a single bound from his tearful melancholy and his sublime\nreligious passion, he told him some story, or indulged in\nsome jest, that \ufb01lled his own heart with mirthfulness, and\nawoke convulsions of laughter in him who heard it.\nThese sudden and wide transitions of feeling were\ncommon with him. He lived for years a double life \u2014 a deep\nand a shallow one. Oppressed with great responsibilities,\nabsorbed by the most profound problems relating to his\nown spirit and destiny, brought into sympathetic relation\nwith the woes of the world, and living much in the very\ndepths of a sadness whose natural fountain had been\ndeepened by the experience of his life, he found no relief\nexcept by direct and entire translation to that other\nchannel of his life which lay among his shallowest\nemotions. His sense of the ludicrous and the grotesque, of\nthe witty and the funny, was really something wonderful;\nand when this sense was appealed to by a story, or an\nincident, or a jest, he seemed to leave all his dignity aside,\nand give himself up to mirth with no more of self-restraint\nthan if he were a boy of twelve years. He resorted to this\nchannel of life for relief. It was here that he won strength\nfor trial by forgetting trial. It was here that he restored the\nbalance which sadness had destroyed. Such a nature and\ncharacter seem full of contradictions; and a man who is\nsubject to such transitions will always be a mystery to those\nwho do not know him wholly. Thus no two men among his\nintimate friends will agree concerning him.\nThe writer has conversed with multitudes of men who\nclaimed to know Mr. Lincoln intimately; yet there are not\n two of the whole number who agree in their estimate of\nhim. The fact was that he rarely showed more than one\naspect of himself to one man. He opened himself to men in\ndi\ufb00erent directions. It was rare that he exhibited what was\nreligious in him; and he never did this at all, except when\nhe found just the nature and character that were\nsympathetic with that aspect and element of his character.\nA great deal of his best, deepest, largest life he kept almost\nconstantly from view, because he would not expose it to the\neyes and apprehension of the careless multitude.\nTo illustrate the e\ufb00ect of the peculiarity of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nintercourse with men, it may be said that men who knew\nhim through all his professional and political life have\no\ufb00ered opinions as diametrically opposite as these, viz: that\nhe was a very ambitious man, and that he was without a\nparticle of ambition; that he was one of the saddest men\nthat ever lived, and that he was one of the jolliest men that\never lived; that he was very religious, but that he was not a\nChristian; that he was a Christian, but did not know it; that\nhe was so far from being a religious man or a Christian that\n\u201cthe less said upon that subject the better;\u201d that he was the\nmost cunning man in America, and that he had not a\nparticle of cunning in him; that he had the strongest\npersonal attachment, and that he had no personal\nattachments at all \u2014 only a general good feeling toward\neverybody; that he was a man of indomitable will, and that\nhe was a man almost without a will; that he was a tyrant,\nand that he was the softest-hearted, most brotherly man\nthat ever lived; that he was remarkable for his pure-\n mindedness, and that he was the foulest in his jests and\nstories of any man in the country; that he was a witty man,\nand that he was only a retailer of the wit of others; that his\napparent candor and fairness were only apparent, and that\nthey were as real as his head and his hands; that he was a\nboor, and that he was in all essential respects a gentleman;\nthat he was a leader of the people, and that he was always\nled by the people; that he was cool and impassive, and that\nhe was susceptible of the strongest passions. It is only by\ntracing these separate streams of impression back to their\nfountain that we are able to arrive at anything like a\ncompetent comprehension of the man, or to learn why he\ncame to be held in such various estimation. Men caught\nonly separate aspects of his character \u2014 only the fragments\nthat were called into exhibition by their own qualities.\nThus the months passed away until the election. His\nroom was thronged by visitors from every portion of the\nUnion, drawn to him by a great variety of motives; and to\nall he gave an open and cordial welcome. In the meantime\nhis political opponents had virtually given up the contest.\nWhile \nthey \nworked \nfaithfully \nwithin \ntheir \nown\norganizations, they openly or secretly conceded his\nelection. At the South no attempt was made to conceal the\nconviction that he would be the next President of the\nUnited States. Indeed, this was so entirely what they\ndesired that they would have regarded the election of Mr.\nDouglas as a calamity, although it may well be doubted\nwhether they would have been deterred from their disunion\nschemes by his election. They took pains to poison the\n public mind by every possible expedient. They identi\ufb01ed\nthe cause of the republicans with the John Brown raid into\nVirginia, with everything that was o\ufb00ensive to the pride of\nthe \nSouth \nin \nHelper\u2019s \n\u201cImpending \nCrisis,\u201d \nwith\n\u201cabolitionism\u201d \nwhich \nwas \nthe \nmost \ndisgusting \nand\ndangerous sin in the pro-slavery catalogue of sins. It was all\na lie. Not a republican was concerned in or approved or the\nJohn Brown invasion, for which Virginia had exacted the life\nof that stern old enthusiast. Helper\u2019s book was a home\nproduction of the South; and the creed of the party had no\nitem looking to the abolition of slavery. Not content with\nmisrepresenting Mr. Lincoln\u2019s cause and principles, they\ntraduced him and his associates upon the ticket. Mr.\nLincoln was called the \u201cIllinois ape,\u201d and this, not by the\nrabble, but by the leaders of public opinion; while Mr.\nHamlin was actually believed by many southern people to\nbe a mulatto, through the representations of presses and\npoliticians. Every falsehood that could sting the southern\nmind to malignity and resentment against the North, and\nmake detestable the man whom the North was about to\nelect to the presidency, was shamelessly uttered. The\nobject, of course, was to \ufb01ll the southern mind with\nbitterness against the North, to alienate the Union from its\na\ufb00ections, to foster its pride, and to prepare it for the\npremeditated and prepared separation.\nMr. Lincoln saw the gathering storm, and felt that upon\nhim it would expend its wildest fury; yet he cherished no\nresentment against these men or their section for all the\nwrongs they heaped upon him, and the woes they were\n bringing upon the country. He was only an instrument in\nthe hands of a higher power. It was only the natural\nexhibition of the spirit of a system of wrong which was\nmaking its last terrible struggle for life. The hatred aroused\nin him passed over the heads of his enemies and fastened\nitself upon the institution which could make such demons\nof men. If he was an instrument in the hands of a higher\npower, they were instruments in the hands of a lower\npower, malignant but mighty indeed. He had charity,\nbecause he felt these men to be the victims of a false\neducation \u2014 of a great mistake. He remembered that had\nhe been bred as they had been, the probabilities were that\nhe should sympathize with them.\nMr. Lincoln was what was called a wise candidate. He\nheld his tongue. No abuse provoked him to utter a word in\nself-vindication. He had accepted the platform of the party\nand his record was before the country. So he calmly\nawaited the result.\nOn the sixth of November the election took place\nthroughout the whole country, and the result was Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s triumph, not by a majority of the votes cast, but\nby a handsome plurality. The popular vote for him was\n,,; while Stephen A. Douglas received ,,\nvotes, John C. Breckinridge ,, and John Bell ,.\nIn the electoral college Mr. Lincoln had  votes, Mr.\nDouglas receiving , Mr. Breckinridge , and Mr. Bell ;\nand when, on the following thirteenth of February, in a joint\nsession of both Houses of Congress, these votes were\ndeclared, it was the o\ufb00ice of John C. Breckinridge himself,\n then \nVice-President, \nto \npronounce \nMr. \nLincoln \nthe\nconstitutionally elected President of the United States for\nfour years from the succeeding fourth of March. And this\nman who, by going into the election as a candidate for the\npresidency, and declaring the result of the contest, had\nbound himself by every principle of honor to abide by the\nresult, was a foul traitor at heart, and only left the chair he\ndisgraced to become a leader in the armies of treason.\nThe result of the election was great popular rejoicing at\nthe North, great exasperation at the South, great fear and\ntrembling among compromisers of both sections, and a\ngeneral conviction that the crisis so long threatened was\nactually upon the nation. Among the republicans there was\nthis feeling: that they had fairly, on an open declaration of\nprinciples and policy, and strictly according to the\nprovisions of the Constitution, elected a president; and that\nif, for this, the South was determined to make war, the\ncontest might as well come \ufb01rst as last. They knew they\nhad made no proposition and entertained no intention to\ninterfere with slavery in the states where the Constitution\nprotected it, that they had made no aggressions upon the\ninstitution, and had only endeavored to limit its spread into\nfree territory. If this was cause of war, then they were ready\nfor the \ufb01ght. Feeling thus, and thus declaring themselves,\nthey still did not generally believe there would be a war.\nThey thought the matter would yet rise upon the wings of\nsome convenient wind and be blown away.\nOf course the man of all others chie\ufb02y concerned in the\nresults of the election was intensely interested. The e\ufb00ect\n upon his nervous system, not altogether ephemeral, is well\nillustrated by an incident which he subsequently related to\nseveral of his friends, and which has found no better\nrecord, perhaps, than in an article from the pen of Major\nJohn Hay, one of his private secretaries in Washington,\npublished in Harper\u2019s Magazine for July, . Major Hay\nreports the incident as nearly as possible in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nown words.\n\u201cIt was just after my election in ,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln,\n\u201cwhen the news had been coming in thick and fast all day,\nand there had been a great \u2018hurrah boys!\u2019 so that I was well\ntired out and went home to rest, throwing myself upon a\nlounge in my chamber. Opposite to where I lay was a\nbureau with a swinging glass upon it; and looking in that\nglass, I saw myself re\ufb02ected nearly at full length; but my\nface, I noticed, had two separate and distinct images, the\ntip of the nose of one being about three inches from the tip\nof the other. I was a little bothered, perhaps startled, and\ngot up and looked in the glass, but the illusion vanished. On\nlying down again, I saw it a second time, plainer, if\npossible, than before; and then I noticed that one of the\nfaces was a little paler \u2014 say \ufb01ve shades \u2014 than the other. I\ngot up and the thing melted away, and I went o\ufb00; and, in\nthe excitement of the hour forgot all about it, \u2014 nearly, but\nnot quite, for the thing would once in a while come up, and\ngive me a little pang as though something uncomfortable\nhad happened. When I went home, I told my wife about it,\nand a few days after I tried the experiment again, when,\nsure enough, the thing came back again; but I never\n succeeded in bringing the ghost back after that, though I\nonce tried very industriously to show it to my wife, who was\nworried about it somewhat. She thought it was \u2018a sign\u2019 that\nI was to be elected to a second term of o\ufb00ice, and that the\npaleness of one of the faces was an omen that I should not\nsee life through the last term.\u201d\nThe President had good sense enough to regard the\nvision as an optical illusion, growing out of the excited\ncondition of his nervous system at the time \u2014 yet, with that\ntinge of superstition which clings to every sensitive and\ndeeply thoughtful man, in a world full of mysteries, he was\nso \nfar \na\ufb00ected \nby \nit \nas \nto \nfeel \nthat \n\u201csomething\nuncomfortable had happened.\u201d In the light of subsequent\nevents, Mrs. Lincoln\u2019s prophetic interpretation of the vision\nhas almost a startling interest.\nMr. Lincoln had become the most important man on the\ncontinent. Parties were given in his honor, autograph\nhunters beset him everywhere, and o\ufb00ice-seekers met him\non the right hand and on the left. That he felt at home in\nthis new life is not probable, but he had the good sense to\nput on no airs, and to undertake no change of his manners\nin meeting men and women. From the day of his election to\nthe day of his death, he was the same unpretending man\nthat he was when he \ufb01rst entered Spring\ufb01eld to practice\nlaw. He had known nothing of drawing-rooms in his youth,\nand he a\ufb00ected to know nothing of them when every\ndrawing-room of loyal America would have swung wide its\ndoors to welcome him. It was noticed by the critical that he\nfound great di\ufb00iculty in disposing of his hand and feet. It is\n quite possible that they were hard to be disposed of, and\nthat he succeeded with them quite as well as he would if he\nhad been a master of deportment. If the hands were large,\nthey had taken no bribes; if his feet were heavy, they had\noutstripped the \ufb02eetest in the race of ambition. If he could\nnot win admiration for his personal graces, he could win\nlove for his personal goodness.\nHe visited Chicago after his election, and met with a\nmagni\ufb01cent welcome. One or two little incidents of this trip\nwill illustrate especially his consideration for children. He\nwas holding a reception at the Tremont House. A fond\nfather took in a little boy by the hand who was anxious to\nsee the new President. The moment the child entered the\nparlor door, he, of his own motion, and quite to the surprise\nof his father, took o\ufb00 his hat, and giving it a swing, cried,\n\u201cHurrah for Lincoln!\u201d There was a crowd, but as soon as\nMr. Lincoln could get hold of the little fellow, he lifted him\nin his hands, and tossing him toward the ceiling laughingly\nshouted: \u201cHurrah for you!\u201d To Mr. Lincoln it was evidently a\nrefreshing episode in the dreary work of hand-shaking. At a\nparty in Chicago, during this visit, he saw a little girl\ntimidly approaching him. He called her to him, and asked\nher what she wished for. She replied that she wanted his\nname. Mr. Lincoln looked back into the room and said: \u201cBut\nhere are other little girls \u2014 they would feel badly if I should\ngive my name only to you.\u201d The little girl replied that there\nwere eight of them in all. \u201cThen,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln \u201cget me\neight sheets of paper, and a pen and ink, and I will see what\nI can do for you.\u201d The paper was brought, and Mr. Lincoln\n sat down in the crowded drawing-room, and wrote a\nsentence upon each sheet, appending his name; and thus\nevery little girl carried o\ufb00 her souvenir.\nDuring all this period of waiting for o\ufb00ice, Mr. Lincoln\ncarried a calm exterior but events were transpiring in the\nnation that gave him the most intense anxiety, and \ufb01lled\nevery leisure hour with painful thought.\nThere were, of course, the usual e\ufb00orts at cabinet\nmaking on the part of presses and politicians, and he was\nfavored with copious advice. It has been publicly said that\nhe really desired to put Mr. Stephens of Georgia, whom he\nhad been somewhat intimate with in Congress, into his\ncabinet. The appointment was at least strongly urged upon\nhim. The republicans were seeking for some policy by\nwhich the South could be silenced and held to its\nallegiance. Many republicans in Washington were inclined\nto compromise the slavery question on the popular\nsovereignty position. Others thought it would be well to put\nsoutherners into the cabinet, and the names of Stephens of\nGeorgia and Scott of Virginia were mentioned. These facts\na personal friend communicated to Mr. Lincoln, and under\ndate of December eighteenth, he replied: \u201cI am sorry any\nrepublican inclines to dally with popular sovereignty of any\nsort. It acknowledges that slavery has equal rights with\nliberty, and surrenders all we have contended for. Once\nfastened on us as a settled policy, \ufb01llibustering for all south\nof us and making slave states of it follow in spite of us, with\nan early supreme court decision holding our free state\nconstitutions to be unconstitutional. Would Scott or\n Stephens go into the cabinet? And if yea, on what terms?\nDo they come to me? or I go to them? Or are we to lead o\ufb00\nin open hostility to each other?\u201d\nIn Mr. Lincoln, though the prospect was dark and the\nway dangerous, there was no disposition to compromise the\nprinciples of his life and his party, and no entertainment of\nthe illusion that concord could come of discord in his\ncabinet. In the latter matter he kept his own counsel and\nawaited his own time.\n   ha ter    III.\nTHE MILITARY OPERATIONS of  were of the most\nmomentous importance. It was a year of intense activity in\nevery \ndepartment; \nand, \nalthough \nthere \nwere \ngreat\nmiscarriages and serious and perplexing disasters, the\ngrand results were such as to show to the people of the\nwhole country that the end was not far o\ufb00; and that that\nend would leave the rebellion hopeless and helpless at the\nfeet of the national power. Although the principal interest\nwas attached to the operations of the two grand armies\nunder Grant and Sherman, there were minor movements of\nsubsidiary bodies, which attracted considerable attention.\nEarly \nin \nFebruary, \nan \nexpedition \nunder \nGeneral\nGillmore\u2019s direction, for clearing Florida of insurgent\nforces, so as to enable the Union elements of the state to\nreorganize, resulted in a failure. At the same time,\nSherman, proceeding from Vicksburg, with a strong\ninfantry force, and General Smith, starting from Memphis,\nwith a heavy force of cavalry, undertook a joint movement\nfor \nthe \npurpose \nof \ndestroying \nrebel \nsupplies \nand\ncommunications; but they failed in their plan of forming a\njunction, though they were quite successful in their work of\ndestruction. Later in the month, Kilpatrick made his bold\nand dashing raid upon Richmond, blowing up the locks of\nthe Kanawha canal, cutting railways and telegraphs, and\n penetrating within the outer defenses of the rebel capital.\nIn March, the disastrous Red River expedition of General\nBanks occurred. Much damage was done to the rebels, and\nmore was received by ourselves. In April, Fort Pillow was\ncaptured from us; and here occurred one of the most\nshocking outrages of the war, already incidentally alluded\nto in these pages. Some three hundred negro troops, with\nwomen and children, were murdered in cold blood, after\nthey had surrendered. The white o\ufb00icers of these troops\nshared their cruel fate; and the event was greeted with\napproval by rebel newspapers. The history of war is\nillustrated by no deed of blacker barbarism than this. It\n\ufb01lled the country with horror, and inspired a universal\ndemand for retaliation. Mr. Lincoln, who was as deeply\ntouched as any one, promised retaliation publicly; but it\nwas never in\ufb02icted.\nLate in the spring, the western army, under Sherman,\nconfronted Johnston at Chattanooga. The army of the\nPotomac, immediately under General Meade, faced Lee in\nVirginia. Both sides had gathered every available man for\nthe last great trial of arms. Lieutenant-general Grant\nperfected his plans, and, after visiting the western army,\nand consulting with Sherman, he returned to the east, and\ntook the general direction of military a\ufb00airs. Everything\nwas given into his hands; and he was supplied with all the\nmen and material that were desired. \u201cThe particulars of\nyour plans,\u201d said the President to him in a letter, \u201cI neither\nknow, nor seek to know. You are vigilant and self-reliant;\nand, pleased with this, I wish not to obtrude any restraints\n nor constraints upon you.\u201d General Grant\u2019s response to this\nnote of Mr. Lincoln was evidently not given in ignorance of\nthe charges which had so freely been made, by political\nenemies of the administration, that our generals were\ninterfered with by the President and the Secretary of War.\n\u201cFrom my \ufb01rst entrance into the volunteer service of my\ncountry to the present day,\u201d said he, \u201cI have never had\ncause of complaint... Indeed, since the promotion which\nplaced me in command of all the armies, and in view of the\ngreat responsibility and importance of success, I have been\nastonished at the readiness with which everything asked\nfor has been yielded, without even an explanation being\nasked.\u201d\nEverything having been made ready, the two armies\nmoved, at the opening of May, to the work that lay before\nthem. On Tuesday night, May third, the army of the\nPotomac crossed the Rapidan; and on Thursday that series\nof actions was begun which will be known in history as\n\u201cThe Battles of the Wilderness.\u201d Thousands and tens of\nthousands of brave men fell on both sides; but the rebel\ngeneral was obliged, from day to day, to fall back from his\ncarefully prepared defenses, to save his communications;\nwhile Grant \ufb02anked him by a series of swift and daring\nswoops of his gigantic force, until Lee found himself and his\narmy in Richmond. In co-operation with these movements\nof Grant\u2019s army, General Butler pushed up the James River\nwith a large force, and secured and held City Point and\nBermuda Hundred. This was his principal work; but he\nundertook various diversions without remarkable results.\n It was not until the middle of June that the army reached\nthe James River, and commenced the siege of Petersburgh,\nwhich was destined to ultimate in the downfall of the\nrebellion.\nGeneral Sherman pursued the strategy adopted by his\nsuperior. He had a larger army than Johnston, but Johnston\nhad the advantage of strong positions and a knowledge of\nthe country. He also moved toward his supplies, while\nSherman left his behind him. The federal General \ufb02anked\nJohnston out of his works at Buzzard\u2019s Roost; and then,\n\ufb01ghting and \ufb02anking, from day to day, he drove him from\nDalton to Atlanta. Then Johnston was superseded by Hood,\nand Hood assumed the o\ufb00ensive. In three days of bloody\nbattle, the new commander lost half of his army; and then\nhe was glad to get behind the defenses of Atlanta. Here he\nremained more than a month, besieged. In the endeavor to\nescape from the toils which Sherman was weaving around\nhim, he found himself at last thoroughly outgeneraled, and\nwas obliged to run. Atlanta fell into our hands, on the\nsecond of September. Then Hood, a rash and desperate\no\ufb00icer, set o\ufb00 to break up Sherman\u2019s communications; and,\n\ufb01nding himself thoroughly whipped, started for a grand\nmarch to Nashville, where he hoped to \ufb01nd repayment for\nthe losses and disgraces he had su\ufb00ered. Sherman sent\nback to General Thomas, who had been left in command\nthere, a portion of his army, and much of his material of\nwar; and then he turned his hack on Hood, for a march to\nthe sea-coast.\n This march, one of the most remarkable in the history of\nwar, was called by the rebels a retreat. It was begun on the\ntwelfth of November; and, leaving behind supplies and all\nmeans of communication, the gallant host started for the\nAtlantic. The most frantic e\ufb00orts were made by the rebels\nto check the progress of the redoubtable army. Small forces\nhovered in front, in \ufb02ank, and in rear, but nothing impeded\nits march. It was a gala-day a\ufb00air, the soldiers supporting\nthemselves upon the country through which they passed.\nOn the eighth of December, the army arrived within twenty\nmiles of Savannah. On the fourteenth, Fort McAllister was\ntaken; and, on the same day, communication was opened\nwith the federal \ufb02eet, sent to co-operate and bear supplies.\nThe army had reached a new base; and had reached it\nwithout \na \nsingle \ndisaster. \nSavannah \nwas \noccupied\nimmediately, the rebel troops retreating and escaping. On\nthe next day after Fort McAllister fell, Thomas defeated\nHood in Tennessee, and sent him back, with his army cut in\npieces and ruined.\nIn the meantime, Sheridan had whipped Early in the\nShenandoah valley, in a series of brilliant engagements;\nand, although there had been raids of rebel cavalry across\nthe Potomac, and panics and alarms in various quarters,\nthe st of January, , found the Union cause much\nadvanced, and the rebels weakened and despondent.\nSherman \nwas \nat \nSavannah, \norganizing \nfor \nanother\nmovement up the coast; Hood was crushed; Early\u2019s army\nwas destroyed; Price, too, had been routed in Missouri;\nCanby was operating for the capture of Mobile; and Grant,\n with the grip of a bull-dog, held Lee in Richmond, while all\nthese great movements in other parts of the country were\nin progress.\nThere was discord in the counsels of the rebels. They\nbegan to talk of using the negroes as soldiers. The\ncommanding general demanded this measure; and, at last,\nthe singular spectacle was exhibited of a slaveholders\u2019\nrebellion, undertaken to make slavery perpetual, calling\nupon the slaves themselves for help. But the call for help\ncame too late, even had it been addressed to more\npromising sources. Lee was tied, and Sherman was turning\nhis steps toward him; and among the leaders of the\nrebellion there was a fearful looking-for of fatal disasters.\nTwo changes occurred in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s cabinet during\nthe year, in addition to that already noted in the post-o\ufb00ice\ndepartment. Edward Bates of Missouri, the Attorney-\ngeneral, left his post on the \ufb01rst of December, and was\nsucceeded by James Speed of Kentucky. Mr. Chase, the\nSecretary of the Treasury, resigned early in July. That this\nresignation was unexpected and unwelcome to Mr. Lincoln,\nwas evident; but it was immediately accepted. There was\nprobably some personal feeling on both sides, into the\ncauses of which there is no occasion to enter. The matter\nexcited Mr. Lincoln very much \u2014 probably more than\nanything \nthat \nconcerned \nhim \npersonally \nduring \nhis\nadministration. He \ufb01rst appointed to the vacant o\ufb00ice\nGovernor David Todd of Ohio; and, the appointment being\ndeclined, he named Hon. William Pitt Fessenden of Maine.\nMr. Fessenden was a gentleman in whom the country had\n full con\ufb01dence; but, owing to his in\ufb01rm health, he assumed\nthe responsibilities of the place with great reluctance, and\nonly after such an appeal from Mr. Lincoln as he could not\nresist.\nOn the twelfth of October, Chief Justice Taney died; and\nthe friends of Mr. Chase urged that gentleman at once as\nthe proper man to be endowed with the responsibilities of\nthat august o\ufb00ice. But Mr. Chase had his enemies, like all\nthose who have achieved an equally prominent position.\nThe antagonism between his friends and enemies was at\nonce developed; and Mr. Lincoln was approached with all\nthe motives for and against the appointment. In this matter,\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s habit of hearing all the arguments in a case\non which he had already passed his judgment, was\nstrikingly exhibited. Intimate friends of Mr. Lincoln declare\nthat there never was a time during his administration when\nhe did not intend to appoint Mr. Chase to this place, if it\nshould be made vacant by any cause. To all arguments\nwhich related to Mr. Chase\u2019s \ufb01tness or un\ufb01tness for the\no\ufb00ice, the President lent a ready ear; but he was\nexceedingly vexed with those who appealed to his sel\ufb01sh\nresentments. There were not wanting men who tried to\narouse his prejudices, by reporting unpleasant words that\nMr. Chase was alleged to have uttered against the\nPresident; but this gossip was always o\ufb00ensive, because it\nsupposed that he could be a\ufb00ected in his choice by sel\ufb01sh\nmotives. To one man who accused Mr. Chase to him of\nhaving used the patronage of his department to advance his\nown presidential prospects, he simply replied: \u201cWell, Chase\n would make a pretty good president; and, so far as I am\nconcerned, I wish some one would take it o\ufb00 my hands.\u201d To\nanother \nfriend \nhe \nremarked \nthat \nthere \nwere \ntwo\nconsiderations that controlled him in the appointment: \ufb01rst,\nthe man appointed should be an anti-slavery man on\nprinciple; secondly, he should thoroughly understand the\n\ufb01nancial policy of the government. Mr. Chase\u2019s anti-slavery\nprinciples were universally acknowledged, and the \ufb01nancial\npolicy of the government was his own. So, after a delay that\ngave Mr. Chase\u2019s friends and enemies time to urge the\npoints of their respective cases, Mr. Chase received the\nappointment; and the country was no better satis\ufb01ed with\nthis disposition of the matter than was Mr. Lincoln himself.\nOn the sixth of December, Mr. Lincoln sent in his annual\nmessage to Congress, which had assembled on the \ufb01fth.\nThe document opened with a review of the position of\nforeign \ngovernments, \nand \nour \nrelations \nto \nthose\ngovernments. The President announced the ports of\nNorfolk, Fernandina and Pensacola to have been opened by\nproclamation. His view of the Arguelles case, which the\nopposition had made the subject of severe criticism, he\ngave in the words: \u201cFor myself, I have no doubt of the\npower and duty of the executive, under the law of nations,\nto exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in\nthe \nUnited \nStates. \nIf \nCongress \nshould \nthink \nthat\nproceedings in such cases lack the authority of law, or\nought to be further regulated by it, I recommend that\nprovision be made for e\ufb00ectually preventing foreign\nslavetraders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their\n criminal occupation in our country.\u201d Owing to raids into the\nstates, planned in Canada by enemies of the United States\nharbored there, he announced that he had thought proper\nto give notice that, after the expiration of six months, the\nperiod conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangements\nwith \nGreat \nBritain, \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nwould \nhold\nthemselves at liberty to increase their naval armament\nupon the lakes, if they should deem it necessary to do so.\nIncreased taxation had bene\ufb01ted the revenue; and the\nnational banking system had proved to be acceptable to\ncapitalists and the people. The naval exhibit gave a total of\n vessels, carrying , guns, which showed an\nincrease, during the year, of  vessels and  guns. The\nwhole cost of the immense squadrons that had been called\ninto existence since the beginning of the war, was more\nthan two hundred and thirty-eight millions of dollars. One\nmatter the President spoke of with special interest, viz: the\nsteady \nexpansion \nof \npopulation, \nimprovement, \nand\ngovernmental institutions, over the new and unoccupied\nportions of the country, notwithstanding the civil war.\nMr. Lincoln thought \ufb01t to urge the passage of an\namendment \nto \nthe \nConstitution, \nprohibiting \nslavery\nthroughout the United States, notwithstanding the same\nCongress had killed the measure at its previous session. It\nmay be stated here that Mr. Lincoln had contemplated this\nmeasure, and was ready for it long before Congress had\ncome up to his position. Before even an allusion to this\namendment had been publicly made, he talked about it with\nhis friends, and was urged by one of them to become a\n leader in the movement. He replied that he had no ambition\nof that sort, but that he thought that the amendment ought\nto be made, and would be made. For himself, he was\ncontent to let others initiate the pleasure, and win the\ncredit of it. But the matter had arrived at a new stage; and,\nwhen he saw that his in\ufb02uence was really necessary to its\nconsummation, he did not hesitate to exert it.\nMr. Lincoln alluded to the lessons which had been taught\nby the presidential election. This election had proved the\npurpose of the people in the loyal states to maintain the\nintegrity of the Union. It had proved, too, that, although the\nwaste of war had been great, there were actually more men\nin the Union than when the war began. There had been,\nduring the three years and a half of war, an increase of\nnearly one hundred and \ufb01fty thousand voters, without\ncounting the soldiers who, by the laws of their respective\nstates, were not permitted to vote. With this fact in view, it\nwas plain that the government could maintain its contest\nwith the rebellion inde\ufb01nitely, so far as the supply of men\nwas concerned. Mr. Lincoln closed his message by\nremarking that the rebels could, at any moment, have\npeace, by laying down their arms, and submitting to the\nnational authority, under the Constitution. In saying this,\nhowever, he did not mean to retract anything he had said\nabout slavery. He would not retract his Emancipation\nProclamation, nor return to slavery any man free by the\nterms of that proclamation.\nThe most important measure e\ufb00ected by Congress at this\nsession, was the passage of the amendment to the\n Constitution, abolishing slavery in all the states. It passed\nthe House by more than the requisite two-thirds vote,\nhaving passed the Senate during the previous session. The\nevent was hailed with great satisfaction by the friends of\nthe administration; and only a few of the more virulent of\nthe opposition were disa\ufb00ected by it. To the President, the\nmeasure was particularly gratifying; and he took occasion\nto express his satisfaction to a crowd that gathered around\nthe White House, immediately after its adoption. He said\nthat it seemed to him to be the one thing necessary to the\nwinding up of the whole di\ufb00iculty. It completed and\ncon\ufb01rmed the work of his proclamation of emancipation. It\nneeded only to be adopted by the votes of the states; and\nhe appealed to his auditors to go home, and see that work\nfaithfully accomplished.\nThe \ufb01gures which gave the result of the presidential\nelection showed that the country was stronger in men than\nit was at the beginning of the war; and, as the call for \ufb01ve\nhundred thousand men, made in July, had failed to produce\nall the soldiers which the war, much longer protracted,\nwould require, the President issued a call, on the\nnineteenth of December, for three hundred thousand more.\nA peace conference, procured by the voluntary and\nirresponsible agency of Mr. Francis P. Blair, was held on the\nsteamer River Queen, in Hampton Roads, on the d of\nFebruary, , between President Lincoln and Mr.\nSeward, \nrepresenting \nthe \ngovernment, \nand \nMessrs.\nAlexander H. Stephens, J.A. Campbell and R.M.T. Hunter,\nrepresenting the rebel confederacy. It was an informal\n a\ufb00air, entirely verbal in its conduct, and unproductive of\nresults. The President consented to become a party to the\ninterview, on representations made by General Grant, who\nregarded at least two of the commissioners as very sincere\nin their desire for peace. In the conference, these\ncommissioners favored a postponement of the question of\nseparation, and mutual e\ufb00orts of the two governments\ntoward some extrinsic policy for a season, so as to give time\nfor the passions of the people to cool. The armies,\nmeantime, were to be reduced, and the intercourse\nbetween the people of the two sections to be resumed. This\nthe President considered as equivalent to an armistice or\ntruce; and he informed them that he could agree to no\ncessation \nof \nhostilities, \nexcept \non \nthe \nbasis \nof \na\ndisbandment of the insurgent forces, and the recognition of\nthe national authority throughout all the states of the\nUnion. He also declared it impossible to recede from his\nEmancipation Proclamation; and informed the Richmond\ngentlemen that Congress had passed the constitutional\namendment, prohibiting slavery; stating, in addition, that\nthe amendment would doubtless be perfected by the action\nof three-fourths of the states. There was an earnest desire\nfor peace on both sides, without a doubt; but Mr. Lincoln\ncould, with truth to himself and honor to his country, make\npeace only on certain essential conditions; while the hands\nof the commissioners were tied by the obstinacy which\nreigned in Richmond.\nThe reports of the conversation at this conference are\nvery meager, necessarily; but enough has been made public\n to show that some of the incidents were very interesting\nand somewhat amusing. The Augusta (Georgia) Chronicle\nhas published an account of the conference, which is said\nto have been prepared under the eye of Mr. Stephens. This\naccount states that Mr. Lincoln declared that, in his\nnegotiations for peace, he could not recognize another\ngovernment inside of the one of which he alone was\nPresident. \u201cThat,\u201d said he, \u201cwould be doing what you so\nlong asked Europe to do in vain, and be resigning the only\nthing the Union armies are \ufb01ghting for.\u201d To this, Mr. Hunter\nreplied that the recognition of Davis\u2019 power to make a\ntreaty was the \ufb01rst and indispensable step to peace; and, to\nillustrate his point, he referred to the correspondence\nbetween King Charles the First and his Parliament, as a\nreliable precedent of a constitutional ruler treating with\nrebels. The Chronicle\u2019s account says that at this point \u201cMr.\nLincoln\u2019s face wore that indescribable expression which\ngenerally preceded his hardest hits; and he remarked:\n\u2018Upon questions of history, I must refer you to Mr. Seward,\nfor he is posted in such things, and I don\u2019t profess to be;\nbut my only distinct recollection of the matter is that\nCharles lost his head.\u2019\u201d\nThe President told his \u201clittle story,\u201d too, on this occasion,\nthe best version of which is given in Mr. Carpenter\u2019s\nReminiscences. They were discussing the slavery question,\nwhen Mr. Hunter remarked that the slaves, always\naccustomed to work upon compulsion, under an overseer,\nwould, if suddenly freed, precipitate not only themselves,\nbut the entire society at the South, into irremediable ruin.\n No work would be done, but blacks and whites would\nstarve together. The President waited for Mr. Seward to\nanswer the argument; but, as that gentleman hesitated, he\nsaid: \u201cMr. Hunter, you ought to know a great deal better\nabout this matter than I, for you have always lived under\nthe slave system. I can only say, in reply to your statement\nof the case, that it reminds me of a man out in Illinois, by\nthe name of Case, who undertook, a few years ago, to raise\na very large herd of hogs. It was a great trouble to feed\nthem; and how to get around this was a puzzle to him. At\nlength, he hit upon the plan of planting an immense \ufb01eld of\npotatoes; and, when they were su\ufb00iciently grown, he\nturned the whole herd into the \ufb01eld, and let them have full\nswing, thus saving not only the labor of feeding the hogs,\nbut that also of digging the potatoes! Charmed with his\nsagacity, he stood one day leaning against the fence,\ncounting his hogs, when a neighbor came along. \u2018Well,\nwell,\u2019 said he, \u2018Mr. Case, this is all very \ufb01ne. Your hogs are\ndoing very well just now; but you know out here in Illinois\nthe frost comes early, and the ground freezes a foot deep.\nThen what are they going to do?\u2019 This was a view of the\nmatter which Mr. Case had not taken into account.\nButchering time for hogs was away on in December or\nJanuary. He scratched his head, and at length stammered,\n\u2018Well, it may come pretty hard on their snouts, but I don\u2019t\nsee but it will be root hog or die! \u2018\u201c\nIt is not supposed that Mr. Lincoln hoped for more from\nthis conference than he did from the Niagara Falls\nnegotiations; but he was determined to show that he was\n ready for peace, on the only grounds that would satisfy the\nloyal people of the country. The result strengthened the\nfaith of the people in him; and the rebel President seized\nupon it to stir the ashes in the southern heart, in the vain\nhope to \ufb01nd fuel there which the long \ufb01re had left\nunconsumed.\nCongress adjourned by constitutional limitation on the\nthird of March, although the Senate was at once convened\nin extra session, in accordance with a proclamation of the\nPresident.\nOn the day of the adjournment of Congress, Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\n\ufb01rst term of o\ufb00ice expired. Four years of bloody war had\npassed away \u2014 four years marked by the most marvelous\nchanges in the spirit, position, feelings, principles and\ninstitutions of the American people. The great system of\nwrong, out of which the rebellion had sprung, was in rapid\nprocess of dissolution, and already beyond the reach of\nresuscitation. The government had passed through the\nseverest tests, and had emerged triumphant. There was no\nlonger doubt in the hearts of the people, and no longer\ncontempt among the nations of the earth. Abraham Lincoln,\nthe humble and unobtrusive citizen, the self-educated and\nChristian man, had been tried, and had not been found\nwanting. His foes no longer denied, and his friends no\nlonger doubted, his great ability. He was, in every sense,\nthe \ufb01rst citizen of the republic; and he had taken his place\namong the leading rulers of the world.\nMr. Lincoln was re-inaugurated into the presidential\no\ufb00ice on the fourth of March. An immense crowd was in\n attendance \u2014 a crowd of a\ufb00ectionate friends, not doubtful\nof the President, and not doubtful of one another and the\nfuture, as at the \ufb01rst inauguration. Chief Justice Chase\nadministered the oath of o\ufb00ice; and then Mr. Lincoln read\nhis inaugural address \u2014 a paper whose Christian\nsentiments and whose reverent and pious spirit has no\nparallel \namong \nthe \nstate \npapers \nof \nthe \nAmerican\nPresidents. It showed the President still untouched by\nresentment, still brotherly in his feelings toward the\nenemies of the government, and still profoundly conscious\nof the overruling power of Providence in national a\ufb00airs.\nThe address was as follows:\n\u201cFellow-Countrymen \u2014 At this second appearing to take\nthe oath of the Presidential o\ufb00ice, there is less occasion for\nan extended address than there was at the \ufb01rst. Then a\nstatement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued\nseemed very \ufb01tting and proper. Now, at the expiration of\nfour years, during which public declarations have been\nconstantly called forth on every point and phase of the\ngreat contest which still absorbs the attention and\nengrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could\nbe presented.\n\u201cThe progress of our arms, upon which all else chie\ufb02y\ndepends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and it\nis, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all.\nWith high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it\nis ventured.\n\u201cOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all\nthoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war.\n All dreaded it; all sought to avoid it. While the inaugural\naddress was being delivered from this place, devoted\naltogether to saving the Union without war, agents were in\nthe city seeking to destroy it without war \u2014 seeking to\ndissolve the Union and divide the e\ufb00ects by negotiation.\nBoth parties deprecated war; but one of them would make\nwar rather than let the nation survive, and the other would\naccept war rather than let it perish; and the war came.\n\u201cOne eighth of the whole population were colored slaves,\nnot distributed generally over the Union, but localized in\nthe southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar\nand powerful interest. All knew that this interest was\nsomehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate\nand extend this interest, was the object for which the\ninsurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the\ngovernment claimed no right to do more than to restrict the\nterritorial enlargement of it.\n\u201cNeither party expected for the war the magnitude or the\nduration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated\nthat the cause of the con\ufb02ict might cease with, or even\nbefore, the con\ufb02ict itself should cease. Each looked for an\neasier triumph, and a result less fundamental and\nastounding.\n\u201cBoth read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and\neach invokes his aid against the other. It may seem strange\nthat any men should dare to ask a just God\u2019s assistance in\nwringing their bread from the sweat of other men\u2019s faces;\nbut let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of\nboth could not be answered. That of neither has been\n answered fully. The Almighty has his own purposes. \u2018Woe\nunto the world because of o\ufb00ences, for it must needs be\nthat o\ufb00ences come: but woe to that man by whom the\no\ufb00ence cometh.\u2019 If we shall suppose that American slavery\nis one of these o\ufb00ences, which in the providence of God\nmust needs come, but which having continued through his\nappointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he gives\nto both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to\nthose by whom the o\ufb00ence came, shall we discern therein\nany departure from those divine attributes which the\nbelievers in a living God always ascribe to him? Fondly do\nwe hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of\nwar may soon pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue\nuntil all the wealth piled by the bondman\u2019s two hundred\nand \ufb01fty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until\nevery drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid with\nanother drawn with the sword; as was said three thousand\nyears ago, so still it must be said; \u2018The judgments of the\nLord are true and righteous altogether.\u2019\n\u201cWith malice toward none, with charity for all, with\n\ufb01rmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us\nstrive on to \ufb01nish the work we are in, to bind up the\nnation\u2019s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the\nbattle and for his widow and orphans, to do all which may\nachieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among\nourselves and with all nations.\u201d\nOn the sixth of March, Mr. Fessenden, who had never\nregarded himself as permanently in the o\ufb00ice of Secretary\nof the Treasury, resigned; and Hugh McCulloch of Indiana\n was appointed to his place. Further than this, Mr. Lincoln\nintroduced no changes into his cabinet. The people had not\nonly indorsed Mr. Lincoln, but they had indorsed his\nadministration. On the eleventh of March, the President\nissued a proclamation, in pursuance of an act of Congress,\ncalling upon deserters to return to their posts, and\npromising them pardon. The proclamation called many of\nthe wanderers back to their duty. The draft for three\nhundred thousand men was commenced on the \ufb01fteenth of\nthe same month, and every necessary measure was adopted\nfor a continuance of the war, should the constant\naccumulation of federal successes fail to bring the rebellion\nto a close.\n   ha ter   I .\nTHE AFFAIRS OF the rebellion were hurrying to a crisis. In\nJanuary, General Sherman started northward with his\nhosts; and the borders of South Carolina were reached on\nthe thirtieth. They swept through the state, a very besom of\ndestruction \u2014 tearing up railroads, burning bridges, living\non the country, and attracting large numbers of negroes to\nthem, to learn that they were free. Columbia was occupied\non the seventeenth of February, and the public property\ndestroyed. The arteries that fed the life of Charleston were\ncut, and the proud city was evacuated without the cost of a\nlife. Though threatened often, the army marched with\nscarcely more di\ufb00iculty than they experienced in their\nmarch across Georgia. Fayetteville, North Carolina, was\nreached and occupied on the twelfth of March; and then\ncommunication was established with Generals Terry and\nScho\ufb01eld at Wilmington, and the army received such\nsupplies as were needed. Battles occurred at Averysboro\nand Bentonville; but still the march was resistless, and the\nforces gathered in front, under command of General\nJohnston, were driven northward as the forest leaves are\ndriven by the wind. On the twenty-second of March,\nGoldsboro was occupied; and there the army remained for\nsome days, while General Sherman visited City Point, for\nconsultation with General Grant.\n The army of Sherman was aiming at Richmond. There\nwas no doubt of that; but Lee was held to the rebel capital\nby Grant, and could not get away. The grand campaign was\nculminating; and, on the day that Sherman entered\nGoldsboro, Mr. Lincoln arrived at City Point, partly to\nrelieve himself of o\ufb00icial cares that had made him sick, and\npartly to be near operations which involved momentous\nconsequences to the country. On the twenty-\ufb01fth of March,\nLee attacked and captured Fort Stedman, but was driven\nout of it with terrible losses; and Mr. Lincoln visited the\nscene on the same day, cheered by the soldiers wherever he\nappeared. The day had been \ufb01xed upon for a grand review,\nin honor of the President; but Mr. Lincoln said: \u201cThis is\nbetter than a review.\u201d On the twenty-eighth of March, a\ncouncil of war was held on the steamer River Queen, at\nCity Point, attended by the President and Generals Grant,\nSherman, Sheridan, Meade, and Ord; and, soon afterwards,\nSherman left to rejoin his army.\nNew dispositions of troops had been in progress for\nseveral days; and, on the day following the council of war,\nthe grand movement of the army of the Potomac began.\nBefore the morning was passed, a new line of battle had\nbeen formed, whose right was on the extreme left of the\nformer \nposition; \nand \nhere \nthe \narmy \ncommenced\nentrenching. A sharp little \ufb01ght occurred in the afternoon,\nwithout material results. On the following day, it rained; but\non Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, Grant\u2019s whole line was\nengaged in a series of heavy battles; and, while these were\nin progress, the President remained at City Point, receiving\n dispatches from the \ufb01eld, and forwarding the substance of\nthem to the country. His \ufb01rst dispatch, on Saturday,\nreported that there had been much hard \ufb01ghting that\nmorning, in which our forces had been driven back. Later\nin the day, he announced that the ground had all been\nretaken, and that our troops were occupying the position\nwhich the rebels held in the morning. On Saturday,\nSheridan and Warren met with great successes. On Sunday,\nthe President announced \u201cthe triumphant success of our\narmies, after three days of hard \ufb01ghting, during which the\nforces on both sides displayed unsurpassed valor.\u201d At half-\npast eight in the evening, Mr. Lincoln telegraphed to Mr.\nStanton that, at half-past four in the afternoon, General\nGrant reported that he had taken twelve thousand\nprisoners, and \ufb01fty pieces of artillery. In the smoke of this\ngreat day of battle, the rebellion was overthrown. Lee, with\nhis shattered army reduced to half of its original numbers,\nby the three days of \ufb01ghting, evacuated Richmond. The\nrebel rams and wooden \ufb02eet were blown up during the\nnight, with terri\ufb01c explosions. On the north side of the\nJames, lay General Weitzel\u2019s corps, waiting to occupy\nRichmond, whenever the signs should indicate the safety of\nan advance. On Monday morning, April third, Weitzel\npushed out the Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry to reconnoiter;\nand they reported that no enemy was to be found. At eleven\nin the morning, he announced by telegraph that he entered\nRichmond at a quarter past eight; that the enemy had left\nin great haste; that he had many guns; that the city was on\n\ufb01re; and that the people received him with enthusiastic\n expressions of joy. His dispatch closed with the statement\nthat Grant had started to cut o\ufb00 Lee\u2019s retreat, and that\nPresident Lincoln had gone to the front.\nThe day on which Richmond fell will long be remembered\nby the people of America, in both sections of the country.\nWhen the news was made public on Monday, the whole\nNorth was thrown into a frenzy of joyous excitement. Every\nbell on every public building, from the Atlantic to the\nPaci\ufb01c, was rung for hours. Cannon answered to cannon,\nfrom mountain to mountain, and from valley to valley. Men\ngrasped one another\u2019s hands in the streets, and wept, or\nembraced each other in the stress of their joyous\nenthusiasm. Public meetings were called, at which the\ndeeds of the gallant heroes who had won the decisive\nvictories were praised and cheered, and the public\nexultation found expression in speech and music. Nothing\nlike it was ever seen upon the continent. The war was over.\nRichmond, that had so long de\ufb01ed the national authority\nand resisted the national arms, was ours. The rebel\nPresident and his associates were fugitives. Lee\u2019s army was\nrunning away, and Grant was pursuing them. The sun of\npeace had fairly risen. The incubus of war that had pressed\nupon the nation\u2019s heart for four long, weary years, was\nlifted; and the nation sprang to its feet, with all possible\ndemonstrations of joyous exultation.\nThe pursuit of Lee was relentlessly prosecuted by our\nvictorious forces; and, after two or three battles, the rebel\nGeneral was obliged to surrender his whole army, which\nhad been reduced by his losses to less than twenty\n thousand men. Within a period of less than two weeks, the\ncity of Richmond was taken, and the proud army of Virginia\npassed out of existence. The capture of Lee was made the\noccasion of another day of popular rejoicing; and the\nscenes and sounds that followed the capture of Richmond\nwere repeated.\nOf the feelings of Mr. Lincoln, as he sat in his tent at City\nPoint, receiving the dispatches which informed him of the\nmomentous movements in progress at the front, no\nimagination can form an exaggerated estimate. But he\ncould not sustain the excitement of those days without\nrelief; and he found it in a way which none but he would\nhave adopted. Just before he arrived at City Point, a pet cat,\nbelonging to General Grant, had presented the General\nwith a little family of kittens. On their owner\u2019s departure,\nthe President took them into his care; and, during all those\ndays of battle, in the intervals while he waited for\ndispatches, he relieved the pressure upon his heart and\nbrain by playing with these kittens. When Richmond had\nfallen, and he was about to start for the front, he took up\none of the kittens, and said: \u201cLittle kitten, I must perform a\nlast act of kindness for you, before I go. I must open your\neyes.\u201d He then manipulated the closed lids as tenderly as a\nmother would handle her child, until he had accomplished\nhis purpose. Then he put her down, and, as he stood\nenjoying her surprise at being able to see, he said sadly:\n\u201cOh that I could open the eyes of my blinded fellow-\ncountrymen, as easily as I have those of that little\n creature!\u201d The eyes of his blinded fellow-countrymen were\nsoon opened, but alas! it involved the closing of his own!\nMr. Lincoln belied his own estimate of his physical\ncourage by going directly into the fallen capital, so lately\nswarming with armed enemies, and so crowded still with\nsullen rebels. He did this apparently without a thought of\ndanger, although the whole loyal North trembled with\napprehension. He went up in a man-of-war, on the\nafternoon of Monday, landed at the Rocketts below the city,\nand with his boy \u201cTad\u201d rode up the remaining mile in a\nboat. He entered the city in no triumphal car. No brilliant\ncavalcade accompanied him; but on foot, with no guard\nexcept the sailors who had rowed him up the James, he\nentered and passed through the streets of the fallen\ncapital. But his presence soon became known to the\ngrateful blacks, who pressed upon him with their thankful\nejaculations and tearful blessings on every side. Better and\nmore expressive were the hats and handkerchiefs, tossed in\nthe air by these happy and humble people, than \ufb02ags and\nstreamers, \ufb02oating from masts and house-tops. \u201cGlory to\nGod! Glory! Glory!\u201d shouted the black multitude of\nliberated slaves. \u201cI thank you dear Jesus, that I behold\nPresident Linkum,\u201d exclaimed a woman standing in her\nhumble doorway, weeping in the fullness of her joy.\nAnother, wild with delight, could do nothing but jump, and\nstrike her hands, and shout with wild reiteration: \u201cBless de\nLord! Bless de Lord! Bless de Lord!\u201d At last, the streets\nbecame choked with the multitude, and soldiers were\ncalled to clear the way. A writer in the Atlantic Monthly, to\n whom the author is indebted for the most of these\nparticulars, says that one old negro exclaimed: \u201cMay de\ngood Lord bless you, President Linkum!\u201d while he removed\nhis hat, and the tears of joy rolled down his cheeks. \u201cThe\nPresident,\u201d the account proceeds, \u201cremoved his own hat,\nand bowed in silence; but it was a bow which upset the\nforms, laws, customs, and ceremonies of centuries. It was a\ndeath-shock to chivalry, and a mortal wound to caste.\u201d\nAfter a visit to General Weitzel\u2019s headquarters, and a\ndrive around the city, he returned to City Point. On\nThursday, he visited the city again, accompanied by Mrs.\nLincoln and the Vice-president, with others. While he was\nin Richmond on this occasion, he held important interviews\nwith leading citizens, prominent among whom was Judge\nCampbell, one of the parties in the Hampton Roads\nconference. The Judge urged him to issue a proclamation,\npermitting the Virginia Legislature to assemble, under the\nrepresentation \nthat \nthat \nbody \nwould \nrecognize \nthe\nsituation, and withdraw the Virginia troops from the\nsupport of Lee. After his return to City Point, he addressed\na note to General Weitzel, directing him to permit the\nlegislature to assemble, and to protect them until they\nshould attempt some action hostile to the United States. He\nwas also directed to show the note to Judge Campbell, but\nnot to make it public. The Judge sent an account of his\ninterview and its results to the Richmond Whig; and, this\nhaving been copied into the Washington Chronicle, after\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s return to the federal capital, the President\nwas very indignant. The breach of con\ufb01dence on the part of\n Judge \nCampbell, \nand \nthe \nmisrepresentations \nwhich\naccompanied it, quite exhausted his patience. As Lee\u2019s\narmy had surrendered, and there was no further apology\nfor the desire to have the legislature assemble, he revoked\nhis permission for its convocation. It was evident, in a\ncabinet meeting that was held a few days afterward, that\nJudge Campbell\u2019s course had much embittered him. He had\nbeen inclined to trust in the personal honor of rebels with\nwhom he had been brought in contact; but he evidently felt\nthat his con\ufb01dence had been practiced upon by Campbell;\nand the fact stung him to indignation, if not anger.\nThe order produced an unpleasant e\ufb00ect upon the public\nmind, and its revocation was received with grati\ufb01cation all\nover the North. The revocation did not come early enough,\nhowever, to save serious di\ufb00iculty in other quarters; for\nSherman, negotiating with Johnston, patterned his policy\nupon that of the President, and brought down upon himself\nthe reprobation of the loyal press of the country \u2014\nreprobation which, in extreme instances, assumed the form\nof direct charges of disloyalty against this gallant and most\nloyal soldier. But Johnston surrendered; and soon there was\nnot an army of the rebellion that had not given itself up to\nour forces, or been disbanded and scattered.\nThe great rebellion was ended. General Grant reached\nWashington on the thirteenth of April, and held an\ninterview with the President and Mr. Stanton, the result of\nwhich was the issue of an order from the War Department\non the same day, or, rather, of a statement that orders\nwould immediately be issued, to stop drafting and\n recruiting, to curtail purchases for arms, ammunition and\nsupplies, to reduce the number of general and sta\ufb00 o\ufb00icers\nto the necessities of the service, and to remove military\nrestrictions on trade and commerce.\nThe American people were \ufb02oating on the high tide of\njoy. All were glad and happy; and, as they returned their\nthanks to the Giver of all good for victory and peace, they\ndid not forget the instrument he had used in the execution\nof his plans. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s name was on every tongue. The\npatient man who had su\ufb00ered the pain of a thousand\ndeaths during the war \u2014 who had been misconstrued,\nmaligned, and condemned by personal and party enemies,\nand questioned and criticised by captious friends, \u2014 was\nthe man above all others who stood in the full sunshine of\nthe popular a\ufb00ection. His motives were vindicated, his\npolicy had been sanctioned by success, and his power had\nbeen proved. He was the acknowledged savior of his\ncountry, and the liberator of a race. He had solved the great\nproblem of popular government; he had settled the great\nquestion of African slavery on the continent. He had won a\nglorious place in history; and his name had been committed\nto the a\ufb00ectionate safe-keeping of mankind.\nOn the evening of the eleventh of April, the White House\nwas brilliantly illuminated; and to the immense crowd\ngathered around it, to express their joyous congratulations,\nLincoln delivered his last public address. He said little\nabout \nvictory, \nfurther \nthan \nbrie\ufb02y \nto \nexpress \nhis\nacknowledgments to the soldiers who had fought, and the\nGod who had prospered their arms; but turning his eyes\n from the past, he regarded the future, and the new duties\nand \nperplexities \nwhich \nit \nwas \ncertain \nto \nbring.\n\u201cReconstruction\u201d was the burden of his speech; and he\nexplained, at length, his connection with the e\ufb00orts at\nreconstruction which had taken place in Louisiana. The\nquestion as to whether the rebel states were out of the\nUnion, or in it, he regarded as a \u201cpernicious abstraction.\u201d\n\u201cWe all agree,\u201d said he, \u201cthat the seceded states, so called,\nare out of their proper practical relation with the Union;\nand that the sole object of the government, civil and\nmilitary, in regard to those states, is to again get them into\ntheir proper practical relation.\u201d He believed the state\ngovernment of Louisiana o\ufb00ered for that state a practicable\nplan of return, but he was not committed to that plan alone.\nThe quickest way back to the old relations with the\ngovernment was the best way, without any regard to any\n\ufb01nely spun theories.\nThe Louisiana Legislature had rati\ufb01ed the Constitutional\namendment abolishing slavery, and Mr. Lincoln said: \u201cThese\ntwelve thousand persons (the loyal element of the state) are\nthus fully committed to the Union, and the perpetuation of\nfreedom in the state \u2014 committed to the very things, and\nnearly all the things, the nation wants; and they ask the\nnation\u2019s recognition, and its assistance to make good this\ncommittal. Now, if we reject and spurn them, we do our\nutmost to disorganize and disperse them. We, in fact, say to\nthe white man: \u2018You are worthless, or worse: we will\nneither help you nor be helped by you.\u2019 To the blacks we\nsay: \u2018This cup of liberty which these, your old masters, held\n to your lips, we will dash from you, and leave you to the\nchances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in\nsome vague and unde\ufb01ned when, where, and how.\u2019\u201d\nAll the President\u2019s plans considered the welfare of the\nblack man as well as the white; and there will be no better\nopportunity to give his views of negro su\ufb00rage than this\npage will furnish. This great question, which promises to be\na stone of stumbling and a rock of o\ufb00ence to the party\nwhich placed Mr. Lincoln in power \u2014 a stone which is\ncertain, in the administration of God\u2019s providence, to\nbecome the head of the corner \u2014 was one which he had\ncarefully considered, and upon which, with his respect for\nhuman rights, he could have but one opinion. In a letter to\nthe late General Wadsworth, he once said: \u201cYou desire to\nknow, in the event of our complete success in the \ufb01eld, the\nsame being followed by loyal and cheerful submission on\nthe part of the South, if universal amnesty should not be\naccompanied with universal su\ufb00rage. Since you know my\nprivate inclinations as to what terms should be granted to\nthe South, in the contingency mentioned, I will here add\nthat, if our success should thus be realized, followed by\nsuch desired results, I cannot see, if universal amnesty is\ngranted, how, under the circumstances, I can avoid\nexacting in return universal su\ufb00rage, or at least su\ufb00rage on\nthe basis of intelligence and military service.\u201d\nThus stands Mr. Lincoln\u2019s record on this question, and\nthus must stand the record of every man whose love of men\nand whose regard for human rights are as genuine as those\nwhich moved the heart of the good President. The party\n which loved and supported Mr. Lincoln cannot deny the\nprinciple of universal su\ufb00rage, without denying both Mr.\nLincoln and the everlasting principles of right upon which\nhe based his action \u2014 upon which they have won all their\nsuccesses. And if, for immediate advantage, in the strife for\npower, they so far turn their backs upon their record as to\ndeny manhood to the African, and refuse to recognize his\nservice in the salvation of the republic, they are sure to be\ndefeated, as they will be certain to deserve defeat.\n   ha ter   I.\nEARLY IN NOVEMBER, an event occurred which gave to our\nrelations with England a very threatening aspect \u2014 an\nevent which aroused the ire of the British people to a\nfeverish pitch, encouraged the rebels, and \ufb01lled with\nuneasiness the friends of the government. Although the\nblockade, under the energetic measures of the government,\nhad become something very di\ufb00erent from a blockade on\npaper, there were still many ports in the southern states\nwhich carried on a large contraband commerce, through\nthe agency of blockade-runners, the majority of which were\nowned in England, and navigated by British seamen. The\ncapture of the Hatteras forts and of the defenses of Port\nRoyal Harbor had shut two of these ports; but Charleston,\nnotwithstanding all the e\ufb00orts of the blockading \ufb02eet,\ncontinued to receive numbers of foreign vessels, and to\ndispatch them in safety. On the twelfth of October, the\nsteamship Theodora shot out of that harbor, with two\nnotorious rebels on board, James M. Mason and John\nSlidell, both perjured senators of the United States, and\naccredited by the Davis government respectively to the\ngovernments of England and France. They went to get\nrecognition for their government. They went as enemies of\nthe United States.\n Proceeding to Cuba, these emissaries took passage from\nHavana on the seventh of November, on the British mail\nsteamer Trent, bound immediately for St. Thomas. On the\nfollowing day, the Trent was hailed by the United States\nfrigate San Jacinto, Captain Wilkes, who directed a shot\nacross her bows to bring her to. Then two o\ufb00icers and\ntwenty men, more or less, put o\ufb00 from the San Jacinto,\nboarded the Trent, and, after a search, took out Mr. Mason\nand Mr. Slidell and their two secretaries, and, by force,\nagainst the protest of the Trent\u2019s o\ufb00icers, bore them to\ntheir vessel. These rebel emissaries Captain Wilkes brought\nto the United States, and they were lodged in Fort Warren.\nThe excitement which this a\ufb00air produced in both\ncountries was intense, and but little favorable to its calm\nconsideration. It was unquestionably a doubtful proceeding,\nand cool British blood came up to a boiling heat wherever\nin England or her provinces the intelligence of the a\ufb00air\nwas published. The news found the loyal people of America\nsmarting under a sense of the injustice of the relation\nwhich England had assumed toward their struggle, and\nsensitive to the insults which their people had received\nfrom the British press and public. America came to care\nless for England afterward; but then she was sensitive in\nevery \ufb01ber to her opinion, her lack of sympathy, and her\ncovert aid to the rebellion. To the American public the news\nof this capture was most grateful. They felt that whatever\nthe laws of nations might be \u2014 and in these they were but\nlittle versed \u2014 it was morally right that these men should\nbe in their power, and that it was morally wrong that any\n other power should have our traitors under its protection.\nSo they greeted the event with huzzas, and made a hero of\nthe impulsive Captain Wilkes, who, though a most loyal and\nexcellent person, was possessed by a zeal that sometimes\nsurpassed his discretion.\nThe e\ufb00ect of this capture was, of course, foreseen by the\ngovernment; and on the thirtieth of November Mr. Seward\ncommunicated to Mr. Adams, our minister in England, a\nstatement of the facts, with the assurance that Captain\nWilkes had acted without any instructions from the\ngovernment, and that our government was prepared to\ndiscuss the matter in a friendly spirit, so soon as the\nposition of the British government should be made known.\nEarl Russell wrote under the same date to Lord Lyons,\nrehearsing his understanding of the facts of the case, and\nsaying that his government was \u201cwilling to believe that the\nnaval o\ufb00icer who committed the aggression was not acting\nin compliance with any authority from his government,\u201d\nbecause the government of the United States \u201cmust be fully\naware that the British government could not allow such an\na\ufb00ront to the national honor to pass without full\nreparation.\u201d The minister expressed the hope that the\nUnited States would, of its own motion, release the\ncommissioners, and make an apology.\nThis was a very sensible and neighborly dispatch, but\nEarl Russell seems to have been subjected afterward to a\npressure that changed his feelings and sharpened his\npolicy, for, in a subsequent note, he transformed his polite\ndispatch into an insulting ultimatum. Lord Lyons was\n directed to wait seven days after having made his demand\nfor reparation; and then, in case no answer should be\ngiven, or any other answer should be given than a full\ncompliance with the terms of the demand, he should pack\nup the archives of the legation, and return to London,\nbringing his archives with him. Usually an ultimatum comes\nat the end of a long series of negotiations \u2014 after all the\nresources of diplomacy are exhausted \u2014 after there is\nplainly seen to be a warlike, or unreasonable, or\ncontumacious spirit on the part of the power from which\nredress is sought. Earl Russell gave Mr. Lincoln his\nultimatum at the start. It was an insult \u2014 a threat. It was\nuttered to gratify the war-like feeling of the British people.\nThere is no question that they desired war; and when the\nBritish people are mentioned in this connection, those are\nmeant who, in print and speech, represent them and\nassume to speak for them. War with America was looked\nupon in England as probable. Measures were taken to\nprepare for it. Indeed, many of the London journals\nregarded war as inevitable; and when the peaceful nature\nof Mr. Seward\u2019s \ufb01rst dispatches were known, the Morning\nPost hastened to publish in large type an o\ufb00icial\ncontradiction of the news. \u201cThe war will be terrible,\u201d said\nthe London journals. \u201cIt will begin by a recognition of the\nSouth, by the alliance of the South, by the assured triumph\nof the South.\u201d That was the precise point. War was wanted\nby the people, that their cherished desire for the disruption\nof the Republic might be ful\ufb01lled; and they were\n disappointed when they found that even an impertinent\nultimatum could not bring it.\nIf British statesmen sympathized with these views and\nfeelings, \u2014 and some of them did, \u2014 it showed how poorly\ninformed they were; for there was never anything in the\ndi\ufb00iculty, from the \ufb01rst, to give either government alarm.\nThe British people found that there was a government at\nWashington, \u2014 calm, digni\ufb01ed and intelligent, not under\nthe control of the mob at all, and showing, in the cool\nindependence of its action, its entire freedom from the\nmisdirected passions of the people. Only in the early\napproval of the Secretary of the Navy and of the lower\nHouse of Congress, awarded to Captain Wilkes, was there\nanything to give the British government cause of alarm, or\nground of serious complaint; and the news of these ill-\nadvised indorsements reached England after the tempest of\npassion had been spent.\nOn the twenty-sixth of December Mr. Seward addressed\na note to Lord Lyons, in which he elaborately discussed all\nthe questions growing out of the case. The paper was one\nof great moderation, and consummate ability \u2014 indeed, one\nof the \ufb01nest to which he ever gave utterance. It was a\nprofound lesson in the law of nations, which could not be\nread without bene\ufb01t by statesmen everywhere. By it the\nBritish government learned that there were two sides to\nthe case, and that there was something to be said upon the\nside of Captain Wilkes; for in it he argued most ingeniously,\nif not in all instances decisively, that Messrs. Mason and\nSlidell and their dispatches were contraband of war, that\n Captain Wilkes might lawfully stop and search the Trent for\ncontraband persons and dispatches, and that he had the\nright to capture the persons presumed to have contraband\ndispatches. He did not, however, exercise the right of\ncapture in the manner allowed and recognized by the laws\nof nations, as understood and practically entertained by the\nAmerican government. \u201cIf I decide this case in favor of my\nown government,\u201d said Mr. Seward, \u201cI must disavow its\nmost cherished principles, and reverse and forever\nabandon its essential policy. If I maintain those principles\nand adhere to that policy, I must surrender the case itself.\u201d\nHe therefore declared that the persons held in military\ncustody in Fort Warren would be \u201ccheerfully liberated.\u201d Mr.\nSeward could not forbear to say that, if the safety of the\nUnion required their detention, they would have been\ndetained; to draw a contrast between the action of our\ngovernment and that of Great Britain under similar\ncircumstances; and to indulge in the irony that \u201cthe claim\nof the British government is not made in a discourteous\nmanner.\u201d\nEarl Russell was satis\ufb01ed with the \u201creparation.\u201d The\nprisoners were released, peace between the two nations\nwas kept, the war feeling subsided, disunion sympathizers\nall over Europe were disgusted with Mr. Seward\u2019s\npusillanimity, and at the South there was no attempt to\ndisguise the disappointment felt at the result. The hopes\nexcited in the South by the di\ufb00iculty are well expressed in\nthe language of Pollard\u2019s \u201cHistory of the First Year of the\nWar,\u201d which says: \u201cProvidence was declared to be in our\n favor; the incident of the Trent was looked upon almost as a\nspecial dispensation; and it was said in fond imagination\nthat on its deck and in the trough of the weltering Atlantic\nthe key of the blockade had at last been lost.\u201d The same\nauthor continues: \u201cThe surrender was an exhibition of\nmeanness and cowardice unparalleled in the political\nhistory of the civilized world.\u201d Patriots may well be content\nwith a decision which brought grief to their enemies\neverywhere, and raised the whole nation in the respect of\nChristendom.\nOn the second day of December, Congress met in regular\nsession, and on the following day Mr. Lincoln sent in his\nannual message. The message opened with an allusion to\nthe attitude of foreign governments, and a statement of the\nfact that, should those governments be controlled only by\nmaterial considerations, they would \ufb01nd that the quickest\nand best way out of the embarrassments of commerce\nconsequent upon the American di\ufb00iculties, would be rather\nthrough the maintenance, than the destruction, of the\nUnion. It was undoubtedly with reference to the excitement\nthen existing concerning the Trent a\ufb00air that he penned\nthe sentence: \u201cSince, however, it is apparent that here, as\nin every other state, foreign dangers necessarily attend\ndomestic di\ufb00iculties, I recommend that adequate and\nample measures be adopted for maintaining the public\ndefenses on every side.\u201d\nThe message announced the \ufb01nancial measures of the\ngovernment to have been very successful; recommended a\nre-organization of the Supreme Court, the machinery of\n which the country had outgrown; suggested a codi\ufb01cation\nor digest of the statutes of Congress, so as to reduce the six\nthousand pages upon which they were printed to the\nmeasure of a volume; indicated his wish that the Court of\nClaims should have power to make its decisions \ufb01nal, with\nonly the right of appeal on questions of law to the Supreme\nCourt; asked for increased attention on the part of\nCongress to the interests of agriculture; expressed his\ngrati\ufb01cation with the success of e\ufb00orts for the suppression\nof the African slave trade; and broached a plan for\ncolonizing such slaves as had been freed by the operation\nof the con\ufb01scation act, passed on the previous sixth of\nAugust, on territory to be acquired. The progress made by\nthe federal armies, and by his own careful and moderate\nmanagement of a\ufb00airs in the border states, is shown in the\nfollowing passage:\n\u201cThe last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably,\nexpired at the assault upon Fort Sumter; and a general\nreview of what has occurred since may not be unpro\ufb01table.\nWhat was painfully uncertain then, is much better de\ufb01ned\nand more distinct now; and the progress of events is plainly\nin the right direction. The insurgents con\ufb01dently claimed a\nstrong support from north of Mason and Dixon\u2019s line; and\nthe friends of the Union were not free from apprehension\non the point. This, however, was soon settled de\ufb01nitely, and\non the right side. South of the line, noble little Delaware\nled o\ufb00 right from the \ufb01rst. Maryland was made to seem\nagainst the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges\nwere burned, and railroads torn up within her limits; and\n we were many days, at one time, without the ability to\nbring a single regiment over her soil to the capital. Now\nher bridges and railroads are repaired and open to the\nGovernment; she already gives seven regiments to the\ncause of the Union, and none to the enemy; and her people,\nat a regular election, have sustained the Union by a larger\nmajority and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before\ngave to any candidate or any question. Kentucky, too, for\nsome time in doubt, is now decidedly and, I think,\nunchangeably ranged on the side of the Union. Missouri is\ncomparatively quiet, and, I believe, can not again be\noverrun by the insurrectionists. These three states of\nMaryland, Kentucky and Missouri, neither of which would\npromise a single soldier at \ufb01rst, have now an aggregate of\nnot less than forty thousand in the \ufb01eld for the Union; while\nof their citizens, certainly not more than a third of that\nnumber, and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubtful\nexistence, are in arms against it. After a somewhat bloody\nstruggle of months, winter closes on the Union people of\nWestern Virginia, leaving them masters of their own\ncountry.\n\u201cAn insurgent force of about \ufb01fteen hundred, for months\ndominating the narrow peninsular region constituting the\ncounties of Accomac and Northampton, and known as the\nEastern Shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous\nparts of Maryland, have laid down their arms; and the\npeople there have renewed their allegiance to, and\naccepted the protection of the old \ufb02ag. This leaves no\n armed insurrectionist north of the Potomac, or east of the\nChesapeake.\n\u201cAlso, we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated\npoints on the southern coast, of Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee\nIsland near Savannah, and Ship Island; and we likewise\nhave some general accounts of popular movements in\nbehalf of the Union in North Carolina and Tennessee.\n\u201cThese things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is\nadvancing steadily and certainly southward.\u201d\nIn the development of the insurrection, Mr. Lincoln\ndetected a growing enmity to the \ufb01rst principle of popular\ngovernment \u2014 the rights of the people. In the grave and\nwell considered public documents of the rebels he found\nlabored arguments to prove that \u201clarge control of the\npeople in government is the source of all political evil.\nMonarchy itself,\u201d he adds, \u201cis sometimes hinted at as a\npossible refuge from the power of the people.\u201d Proceeding\nfrom this, Mr. Lincoln said:\n\u201cIt is not needed, nor \ufb01tting here, that a general\nargument should be made in favor of popular institutions;\nbut there is one point, with its connections, not so\nhackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief attention.\nIt is the e\ufb00ort to place capital on an equal footing with, if\nnot above, labor, in the structure of the government. It is\nassumed that labor is available only in connection with\ncapital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning\ncapital, somehow by the use of it induces him to labor. This\nassumed, it is next considered whether it is best that\ncapital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by\n their own consent, or buy them, and drive them to it\nwithout their consent. Having proceeded so far, it is\nnaturally concluded that all laborers are either hired\nlaborers or what we call slaves. And further, it is assumed\nthat whoever is once a hired laborer, is \ufb01xed in that\ncondition for life.\n\u201cNow, there is no such relation between capital and labor\nas assumed; nor is there any such thing as a free man being\n\ufb01xed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both these\nassumptions are false, and all inferences from them are\ngroundless.\n\u201cLabor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is\nonly the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor\nhad not \ufb01rst existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and\ndeserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its\nrights, which are as worthy of protection as any other\nrights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always\nwill be, a relation between labor and capital, producing\nmutual bene\ufb01ts. The error is in assuming that the whole\nlabor of the community exists within that relation. A few\nmen own capital, and those few avoid labor themselves,\nand, with their capital, hire or buy another few to labor for\nthem. A large majority belong to neither class \u2014 neither\nwork for others, nor have others working for them. In most\nof the southern states, a majority of the whole people of all\ncolors are neither slaves nor masters; while in the\nnorthern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired.\nMen, with their families \u2014 wives, sons, and daughters \u2014\nwork for themselves, on their farms, in their houses, and in\n their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and\nasking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired\nlaborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a\nconsiderable number of persons mingle their own labor\nwith capital \u2014 that is, they labor with their own hands, and\nalso buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a\nmixed, and not a distinct class. No principle stated is\ndisturbed by the existence of this mixed class.\n\u201cAgain: as has already been said, there is not of necessity\nany such thing as the free hired laborer being \ufb01xed to that\ncondition for life. Many independent men everywhere in\nthese states, a few years back in their lives, were hired\nlaborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world,\nlabors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy\ntools or land for himself, then labors on his own account\nanother while, and at length hires another new beginner to\nhelp him. This is the just and generous and prosperous\nsystem, which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and\nconsequent energy and progress, and improvement of\ncondition to all. No men living are more worthy to be\ntrusted than those who toil up from poverty \u2014 none less\ninclined to take or touch aught which they have not\nhonestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a\npolitical power which they already possess, and which, if\nsurrendered, will surely be used to close the door of\nadvancement against such as they, and to \ufb01x new\ndisabilities and burdens upon them, till all of liberty shall\nbe lost.\u201d\n Aside from the bills passed for sustaining the war, and\nsustaining the President in his mode of and means for\nsuppressing the rebellion, very little important action was\ntaken by this session of Congress, that did not relate to\nslavery. The question of \u201carbitrary arrests,\u201d of which the\nenemies of the President made loud complaint, came up,\nand Mr. Lincoln was sustained in the House by a vote of\none hundred and eight to twenty-six. A provision was made\nfor the issue of legal-tender notes, for increasing the\ninternal revenue, and establishing a basis for the payment\nof interest on loans, in accordance with the policy of Mr.\nChase, the distinguished Secretary of the Treasury; and a\ncon\ufb01scation act was passed, more stringent than its\npredecessor.\nWe now enter upon a review of that series of measures\nand movements which culminated in the overthrow of\nslavery; and, as Mr. Lincoln has been assailed on one side\nfor being too slow, and on the other for being too\nprecipitate, these movements and measures deserve\ncareful consideration.\nIf there is one thing that stands out more prominently\nthan any other in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s history, it is his regard for\nthe Constitution and the laws. Especially was this the case\nin relation to that clause of the Constitution which\nprotected slavery, and all the laws by which the relation of\nmaster and slave was preserved. This was not attributable\nto his love of slavery, for he hated it; but it was because\nthat on this point only was he suspected, and on this point\nonly was there any sensitiveness in the nation. He\n voluntarily and frequently declared that he considered the\nslaveholders entitled to a fugitive slave law. By the\nConstitution he was determined to stand; yet there is\nevidence that from the \ufb01rst he considered emancipation to\nbe the logical result of persistence in rebellion. As the\nrebellion progressed, and the rebels themselves had\nforfeited all right to constitutional protection for their\npeculiar institution, he felt himself still withheld from\nmeddling with slavery by any sweeping measure, for, in the\nfour border states \u2014 Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky and\nMissouri \u2014 which had not seceded, the government had\nmany friends, whose hands he felt it his duty to strengthen\nby every possible means. He saw the time of emancipation\ncoming, but he wished to save them; and this was the\nprincipal reason for his delay. How faithfully he endeavored\nto do this, and with how little avail, will appear in the\nnarrative. Amid the attacks of bitter political foes, and the\nreproaches of well-meaning but impatient friends, he had a\ndi\ufb00icult path to pursue.\nFollowing Mr. Lincoln\u2019s lead, Mr. Seward had announced\nto foreign governments that no change in the institutions of\nthe South was contemplated. General McClellan had\nabundant reason in the President\u2019s position for assuring the\npeople of Virginia, as he did, that he contemplated nothing\nof the kind. But the people were becoming discontented\nwith this mild policy, and Congress obeyed their voice by an\nearly tabling of the Crittenden resolution, which had\nsatis\ufb01ed that body at their session in July.\n Mr. Lincoln was quick to see the tendency of the public\nmind, and began at once to shape his measures for the\nresult which could not long be delayed. On the sixth of\nMarch, he sent a message to Congress, recommending the\npassage of a joint resolution which should be substantially\nas follows:\n\u201cResolved: That the United States ought to co-operate\nwith any state which may gradually adopt abolishment of\nslavery, giving to such state pecuniary aid, to be used by\nsuch \nstate \nin \nits \ndiscretion, \nto \ncompensate \nfor\ninconveniences, public and private, produced by such\nchange of system.\u201d\n\u201cIf the proposition contained in the resolution docs not\nmeet the approval of Congress and the country,\u201d added Mr.\nLincoln, \u201cthere is an end; but if it does command such\napproval, I deem it of importance that the states and people\nimmediately interested should be at once distinctly noti\ufb01ed\nof the fact, so that they may begin to consider whether to\naccept or reject it.\u201d It was Mr. Lincoln\u2019s opinion that one of\nthe severest blows the rebellion could receive would be the\nabolition of slavery in the border states. To deprive the\nrebels of the hope of securing the still loyal slave states, he\nbelieved would be substantially to end the rebellion. If\nthese states should abolish slavery, it would in e\ufb00ect be\nsaying to the confederacy, \u201cWe will join you under no\ncircumstances.\u201d He believed that gradual was better than\nsudden emancipation; and that, as a war measure, the\ngovernment would make the scheme of compensation a\npaying one. Still true to his old tenderness on the subject of\n national interference with slavery, he took pains to show\nthat his plan threw the whole matter into the hands of the\nstates themselves.\nThere was kindly warning to his friends in the border\nslave states, in these words:\n\u201cIn the annual message of last December, I thought \ufb01t to\nsay\u2014 \u2018The Union must be preserved; and hence all\nindispensable means must be employed.\u2019 I said this not\nhastily, but deliberately. War has been made, and continues\nto be, an indispensable means to this end. A practical re-\nacknowledgment of the national authority would render the\nwar unnecessary, and it would at once cease. If, however,\nresistance continues, the war must also continue; and it is\nimpossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend,\nand all the ruin which may follow it. Such as may seem\nindispensable, or may obviously promise great e\ufb00iciency\ntoward ending the struggle, must and will come. The\nproposition now made (though an o\ufb00er only), I hope it may\nbe esteemed no o\ufb00ense to ask whether the pecuniary\nconsideration tendered would not be of more value to the\nstates and private persons concerned, than are the\ninstitutions and property in it, in the present aspect of\na\ufb00airs.\n\u201cWhile it is true that the adoption of the proposed\nresolution would be merely initiatory, and not within itself a\npractical measure, it is recommended in the hope that it\nwould soon lead to important practical results. In full view\nof my great responsibility to God and my country, I\n earnestly beg the attention of Congress and the people to\nthe subject.\u201d\nIt took no special degree of sagacity to learn what this\npassage meant; but those for whom this thoughtful\nmeasure was intended, though the resolution went through\nboth Houses of Congress, and stood as a pledge of\ncompensation for emancipation, turned their backs upon it.\nOnly a very few members from the border states voted for\nit. But the President could not let the matter stop there. He\nsaw that emancipation would surely come as a war\nmeasure; and that these slave states that had stood by him\nthrough much di\ufb00iculty, would lose, in that event, that\nwhich the Constitution recognized as their property.\nBefore the close of the session, he invited the senators\nand representatives from those states to a conference, at\nthe Executive Mansion. It was early in July; and, while\nCongress had been talking and acting, McClellan had been\n\ufb01ghting with very unsatisfactory results. The nation was\ndepressed by reverses; and Mr. Lincoln wished to give\nthese men and the people they represented another chance\nto escape from the loss which he felt must soon befall them.\nHaving convened them, he read to them this carefully\nprepared address, in which he argued his own case and\ntheirs, and appealed to them to save themselves and the\ncountry:\n\u201cGentlemen \u2014 After the adjournment of Congress, now\nnear, I shall have no opportunity of seeing you for several\nmonths. Believing that you of the border states hold more\npower for good than any other equal number of members, I\n feel it a duty which I cannot justi\ufb01ably waive, to make this\nappeal to you.\n\u201cI intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you\nthat, in my opinion, if you all had voted for the resolution in\nthe gradual emancipation message of last March, the war\nwould now be substantially ended. And the plan therein\nproposed is yet one of the most potent and swift means of\nending it. Let the states which are in rebellion see\nde\ufb01nitely and certainly that in no event will the states you\nrepresent ever join their proposed confederacy, and they\ncannot much longer maintain the contest. But you cannot\ndivest them of their hope to ultimately have you with them,\nas long as you show a determination to perpetuate the\ninstitution within your own states. Beat them at elections,\nas you have overwhelmingly done, and, nothing daunted,\nthey still claim you as their own. You and I know what the\nlever of their power is. Break that lever before their faces,\nand they can shake you no more forever.\n\u201cMost of you have treated me with kindness and\nconsideration; and I trust you will not now think I\nimproperly touch what is exclusively your own, when, for\nthe sake of the whole country, I ask, can you, for your\nstates, do better than to take the course I urge? Discarding\npunctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times,\nand looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our\ncase, can you do better in any possible event? You prefer\nthat the constitutional relation of the states to the nation\nshall be practically restored without disturbance of the\ninstitution: and if this were done, my whole duty, in this\n respect, under the Constitution and my oath of o\ufb00ice,\nwould be performed. But it is not done, and we are trying\nto accomplish it by war. The incidents of the war cannot be\navoided. If the war continues long, as it must if the object\nbe not sooner attained, the institution in your states will be\nextinguished by mere friction and abrasion \u2014 by the mere\nincidents of the war. It will be gone, and you will have\nnothing valuable in lieu of it. Much of its value is gone\nalready. How much better for you and for your people, to\ntake the step which at once shortens the war, and secures\nsubstantial compensation for that which is sure to be\nwholly lost in any other event! How much better to thus\nsave the money which else we sink forever in the war! How\nmuch better to do it while we can, lest the war ere long\nrender us pecuniarily unable to do it! How much better for\nyou, as seller, and the nation, as buyer, to sell out and buy\nout that without which the war never could have been, than\nto sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in\ncutting one another\u2019s throats!\n\u201cI do not speak of emancipation at once, but of a decision\nat once to emancipate gradually. Room in South America\nfor colonization can be obtained cheaply, and in abundance;\nand, when numbers shall be large enough to be company\nand encouragement for one another, the freed people will\nnot be so reluctant to go.\n\u201cI am pressed with a di\ufb00iculty not yet mentioned \u2014 one\nwhich threatens division among those who, united, are\nnone too strong. An instance of it is known to you. General\nHunter is an honest man. He was, and I hope still is, my\n friend. I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me\nin the general wish that all men everywhere could be free.\nHe proclaimed all men free within certain states, and I\nrepudiated the proclamation. He expected more good and\nless harm from the measure than I could believe would\nfollow. Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not\no\ufb00ense, to many whose support the country cannot a\ufb00ord\nto lose. And this is not the end of it. The pressure in this\ndirection is still upon me, and is increasing. By conceding\nwhat I now ask, you can relieve me, and, much more, can\nrelieve the country in this important point.\n\u201cUpon these considerations I have again begged your\nattention to the message of March last. Before leaving the\ncapital, consider and discuss it among yourselves. You are\npatriots and statesmen, and as such I pray you consider\nthis proposition; and at the least commend it to the\nconsideration of your states and people. As you would\nperpetuate popular government for the best people in the\nworld, I beseech you that you do in nowise omit this. Our\ncommon country is in great peril, demanding the loftiest\nviews and boldest action to bring a speedy relief. Once\nrelieved, its form of government is saved to the world; its\nbeloved history and cherished memories are vindicated;\nand \nits \nhappy \nfuture \nfully \nassured, \nand \nrendered\ninconceivably grand. To you, more than to any others, the\nprivilege is given to assure that happiness and swell that\ngrandeur, and to link your own names therewith forever.\u201d\nWhat Mr. Lincoln said in this paper, touching the\ndissatisfaction with which his revocation of General\n Hunter\u2019s order of emancipation had been received, was\ntrue. People were tired of the governmental protection of\nslavery in the rebel states; and they had reason to be. Mr.\nLincoln felt all this, but he could not forsake his friends,\nuntil he had tried every means to save them. In his\nrevocation of General Hunter\u2019s order, one of the most\nbeautiful and touching appeals that man ever penned,\noccurs an appeal which the mistaken men before him had\nalready had the opportunity of reading. In that paper, after\nquoting the resolution which Congress had passed pledging\nthe country to compensation for emancipation, he said:\n\u201cTo the people of those states I now earnestly appeal. I\ndo not argue \u2014 I beseech you to make the argument for\nyourselves. You cannot, if you would, be blind to the signs\nof the times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged\nconsideration of them, ranging, if it may be, far above\npersonal and partisan politics. This proposal makes\ncommon cause for a common object, casting no reproaches\nupon any. It acts not the Pharisee. The changes it\ncontemplates would come gently as the dews of Heaven,\nnot rending nor wrecking anything. Will you not embrace\nit? So much good has not been done by one e\ufb00ort in all past\ntime, as, in the providence of God, it is now your high\nprivilege to do. May the vast future not have to lament that\nyou have neglected it.\u201d\nStill forbearing, still arguing, still beseeching, Mr.\nLincoln stood before these border-state legislators, for\nwhose sake he was su\ufb00ering sharp reproach in the house of\nhis best friends; but they were unmoved. They could not\n read the signs of the times. Only nine of the twenty-nine\nwho responded gave words of friendliness and approval. If,\nsince then, they have found themselves and their friends in\ndistress through the destruction of their property, they can\nhave no reproaches to cast upon the patient man who so\nfaithfully besought them to save themselves while there\nwas an opportunity.\nTwo acts were passed by this session which respectively\ncalled out a message from the President. The con\ufb01scation\nact, to which allusion has already been made, touched a\nsubject on which he had peculiar views. It would be di\ufb00icult\nto express in the English language the basis of the right of\nCongress to free the slaves of rebels, in clearer and more\nunanswerable tones than Mr. Lincoln used when he wrote:\n\u201cIt is startling to say that Congress can free a slave within a\nstate, and yet, were it said that the ownership of the slave\nhad \ufb01rst been transferred to the nation, and that Congress\nhad then liberated him, the di\ufb00iculty would vanish; and this\nis the real case. The traitor against the general government\nforfeits his slave, at least as justly as he does any other\nproperty; and he forfeits both to the government against\nwhich he o\ufb00ends. The government, so far as there can be\nownership, owns the forfeited slaves; and the question for\nCongress, in regard to them, is, \u2014 Shall they be made free,\nor sold to new masters? I see no objection to Congress\ndeciding in advance that they should be free.\u201d The\nargument of a whole volume would not make the subject\nclearer.\n The other act abolished slavery in the District of\nColumbia, and he merely pointed out an oversight in the\nbill, expressing at the same time his grati\ufb01cation that it\nrecognized \nthe \ntwo \nprinciples \nof \ncolonization \nand\ncompensation. It must have been with peculiar satisfaction\nthat he thus completed a work which he began while he\nwas a member of Congress himself, many years before.\nLate in the session, Mr. Lincoln sent to Congress the\ndraft of a bill for the compensation of any state that might\nabolish slavery within its limits; which, although it was\nreferred to a committee, was not acted upon, as there\nappeared no disposition on the part of the border states to\nrespond to the action which Congress had already taken.\nMeantime, and especially after the enactment of the\ncon\ufb01scation bill, presses and people maintained their\nclamor for a sweeping proclamation of emancipation. The\nclamor took a direct and de\ufb01nite form in a letter addressed\nby Horace Greeley, through the New York Tribune. The\nletter was severe in its terms, and intemperate in spirit.\nAny President who had occupied the o\ufb00ice previous to Mr.\nLincoln, would have passed over such a letter in silence,\nhowever much it might have annoyed or pained him. Mr.\nLincoln, however, never thought of his dignity, and saw no\nreason why the President of the United States should not\nappear in a newspaper, as well as other men. He\naccordingly replied to Mr. Greeley, under date of August\ntwenty-second, in a letter which, for conciseness and\nlucidity, may well be regarded as a model, whether the\n position assumed in it was sound or otherwise. Mr. Lincoln\nwrote as follows:\n\u201cHon. Horace Greeley, Dear Sir: I have just read yours of\nthe nineteenth instant, addressed to myself through the\nNew York Tribune.\n\u201cIf there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact\nwhich I may know to be erroneous, I do not now and here\ncontrovert them.\n\u201cIf there be any inferences which I may believe to be\nfalsely drawn, I do not now and here argue against them.\n\u201cIf there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial\ntone, I waive it in deference to an old friend whose heart I\nhave always supposed to be right.\n\u201cAs to the policy I \u2018seem to be pursuing,\u2019 as you say, I\nhave not meant to leave any one in doubt. I would save the\nUnion. I would save it in the shortest way under the\nConstitution.\n\u201cThe sooner the national authority can be restored, the\nnearer the Union will be \u2014 the Union as it was.\n\u201cIf there be those who would not save the Union unless\nthey could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree\nwith them.\n\u201cIf there be those who would not save the Union unless\nthey could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree\nwith them.\n\u201cMy paramount object is to save the Union, and not\neither to save or destroy slavery.\n\u201cIf I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I\nwould do it; if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I\n would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving\nothers alone, I would also do that.\n\u201cWhat I do about slavery and the colored race, I do\nbecause I believe it helps to save this Union; and what I\nforbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to\nsave the Union.\n\u201cI shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing\nhurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I believe\ndoing more will help the cause.\n\u201cI shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors,\nand I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to\nbe true views.\n\u201cI have here stated my purpose according to my views of\no\ufb00icial duty, and I intend no modi\ufb01cation of my oft-\nexpressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be\nfree.\n\u201cYours, A. Lincoln.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln was anxious to take no steps which be should\nbe obliged to retrace through the lack of popular support,\nand at this time he was carefully measuring the public\nopinion on the subject of emancipation. A part of the\npreliminary work he had accomplished. He had performed\nwith the tenderest and most assiduous \ufb01delity all his duty\ntoward the border slave states. He had warned them,\nbesought them, advised them, to get out of the way of an\nevent which he felt certain would come. He knew that the\ninstitution of slavery would not be worth a straw, in any\nstate, after it should be destroyed in the rebel states. But\nthey turned a deaf ear to his warnings and entreaties; and\n in this manner, if not in the manner desired, took\nthemselves out of his way.\nHis letter to Horace Greeley was, without doubt,\nintended to prepare the mind of the country for\nemancipation, and to exhibit the principles and exigencies\nby which he should be controlled in proclaiming it. He was\nclearing away obstacles, and preparing his ground; and, in\nconnection with events which wait for record, the time for\naction came at last.\nMr. \nCameron \nwas \nnot \nvery \nsuccessful \nin \nthe\nadministration of the a\ufb00airs of his bureau. It is no\nderogation to his ability as a statesman to say that, for the\ndischarge of the duties of the war o\ufb00ice, at the time he\noccupied it, he had no eminent \ufb01tness. It was not the o\ufb00ice\nhe would have chosen for himself. He had immense and\nalmost countless contracts at his disposal, and could give to\nthem but little personal care. That he was overreached,\nunder the circumstances, was almost a matter of course,\nand many of his contracts were very bad ones. Congress,\nafter his resignation, censured him for his loose way of\ndoing business, in intrusting Alexander Cummings of New\nYork with the expenditure of large sums of money without\nrestriction; but Mr. Lincoln, by a special message, assumed\nall the responsibility of Mr. Cummings\u2019 appointment to this\nduty and responsibility. Mr. Cameron resigned his position\non the th of January, ; and Mr. Lincoln showed what\nhe thought of the charges of fraud against him, by\nappointing him minister to Russia. Nevertheless, it was to\nbe said of him that Mr. Chase found it di\ufb00icult to raise\n money while he remained to make contracts. He resigned\nwhile the House was busy with overhauling his a\ufb00airs; and\nit occurred that he sent in his resignation on the same day\non which Mr. Dawes of Massachusetts was making a\npowerful speech against him, and on which the special\ncommittee on government contracts made a report severely\ncondemning his operations.\nMr. Lincoln appointed Edwin M. Stanton of Ohio to the\no\ufb00ice thus vacated. Mr. Stanton was a democrat, and had\nbeen a member of Mr. Buchanan\u2019s cabinet \u2014 was, indeed,\nthe \ufb01rst one in that cabinet to protest against the\ndownright treason into which it was drifting. He was a man\nof indomitable energy, devoted loyalty and thorough\nhonesty. Contractors could not manipulate him, and traitors\ncould not deceive him. Impulsive, perhaps, but true; willful,\nit is possible, but placable; impatient, but persistent and\ne\ufb00icient, \u2014 he became, at once, one of the most marked\nand important of the members of the cabinet. Mr. Lincoln\nloved him and believed in him from \ufb01rst to last. When\ninquired of concerning the reasons for his appointment, Mr.\nLincoln said he rather wished, at \ufb01rst, to appoint a man\nfrom one of the border states, but he knew the New\nEngland people would object; and then, again, it would\nhave given him great satisfaction to appoint a man from\nNew England, but that would displease the border states.\nOn the whole, he thought he had better take a man from\nsome intervening territory; \u201cand, to tell you the truth,\ngentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201cI don\u2019t believe Stanton knows where\nhe belongs himself.\u201d The gentlemen proceeding to discuss\n Mr. Stanton\u2019s impulsiveness, Mr. Lincoln said: \u201cWell, we\nmay have to treat him as they are sometimes obliged to\ntreat a Methodist minister I know of out west. He gets\nwrought up to so high a pitch of excitement in his prayers\nand exhortations, that they are obliged to put bricks into\nhis pockets to keep him down. We may be obliged to serve\nStanton the same way, but I guess we\u2019ll let him jump awhile\n\ufb01rst.\u201d\nThe country has sometimes thought the time for bricks\nhad come; but, on the whole, the leaders of the rebellion\nhave had greatest cause of complaint. Mr. Stanton\u2019s place\nin history will be a proud one.\nMalcontents, who felt that everything went wrong\nbecause there was something wrong in the cabinet, were\nmuch encouraged by the change that had been made, and\npersonally and by letter urged Mr. Lincoln to make further\nchanges. A number of them called upon him to insist on\nchanges that they considered absolutely necessary. Mr.\nLincoln heard them through, and then, with his peculiar\nsmile, said, \u201cGentlemen, the case reminds me of a story of\nan old friend of mine out in Illinois. His homestead was\nvery much infested with those little black and white\nanimals that we needn\u2019t call by name; and, after losing his\npatience with them, he determined to sally out and in\ufb02ict\nupon them a general slaughter. He took gun, clubs and\ndogs, and at it he went, but stopped after killing one, and\nreturned home. When his neighbors asked him why he had\nnot ful\ufb01lled his threat of killing all there were on his place,\nhe replied that his experience with the one he had killed\n was such that he thought he had better stop where he\nwas.\u201d\nThis story was told with no disrespect to Mr. Cameron, or\nto the other members of his cabinet, for he honored them\nall; but it was told to get rid of his troublesome advisers.\nThey went away forgetting that they had failed to make any\nimpression on the President \u2014 forgetting that they had\nfailed in their errand utterly \u2014 and laughing over the story\nby which the President had dismissed them.\n   ha ter   II.\nA CIVILIAN, IGNORANT of the art of war, can only judge a\nmilitary man by what he accomplishes in the long run by\nhis policy and action; and it is di\ufb00icult for such a judge to\nperceive what General McClellan accomplished, With his\nmagni\ufb01cent army of a hundred and sixty thousand as good\nsoldiers as ever the sun shone upon \u2014 well drilled, well fed,\nwell clothed and well armed \u2014 but to scatter and wear out\nthat army, volunteer general advice to a government that\nwas presumed to be competent to the management of its\nown a\ufb00airs, and win the doubtful honor of becoming the\nfavorite of men who, from the \ufb01rst, opposed the war, and\nthrew all possible obstacles in the way of its successful\nprosecution. The whole history of McClellan\u2019s operations is\na history of magni\ufb01cent preparations and promises, of fatal\nhesitations and procrastinations, of clamoring for more\npreparations, \nand \njusti\ufb01cations \nof \nhesitations \nand\nprocrastinations, \nof \ngovernment \nindulgence \nand\nforbearance, of military intrigues within the camp, of\npopular impatience and alarms, and of the waste of great\nmeans and golden opportunities. Even the opportunity of\nbecoming \u201cthe hero of Antietam\u201d came to General\nMcClellan through his culpable remissness in permitting\nthe enemy to cross the Potomac; and this victory lost all its\nvalue by his failure to gather its fruits.\n When General McClellan assumed command, he found\nwaiting for him \ufb01fty thousand men, more or less, in and\naround Washington. He assumed command during the last\ndays of July; and, within a period of less than three months,\nthat army was raised to a force of more than a hundred and\n\ufb01fty thousand men, with \ufb01ve hundred pieces of artillery.\nThe people gave him more men than any one commander\nwas ever known to handle e\ufb00ectively in the \ufb01eld; and the\ngovernment lavishly bestowed upon his army all the\nmaterial of war. The unfortunate matter of Ball\u2019s Blu\ufb00,\nwhich occurred on the twenty-second of October, has\nalready found record. This was the \ufb01rst return for the fresh\nmeans that the government had placed at the commanding\nGeneral\u2019s disposal. The Potomac was blockaded by a small\nforce of rebels, and both the President and Secretary of\nWar felt that there was no necessity for permitting this\nvexatious and humiliating blockade to continue. They tried\nto induce McClellan to aid in this business; and, at one time\nin October, he agreed to send four thousand men to co-\noperate with a naval force for this purpose; but he falsi\ufb01ed\nhis promise, on the ground that his engineers told him that\nso large a force could not be landed. It did not matter that\nthe department assumed the responsibility of landing the\ntroops. It did not matter, even, that he made another\npromise to send the troops. They were never sent, the\nsecond refusal being based upon his fear of bringing on a\ngeneral engagement, which was exactly what ought to have\nbeen brought on. Captain Craven of the navy, with whom\nthese troops were to co-operate, threw up his command in\n disgust, and the rebels never were driven away from the\nPotomac. They kept this grand highway closed until the\nfollowing spring, and then retired of their own accord, and\nat leisure.\nThe con\ufb01dence in General McClellan on the part of the\ngovernment and the country generally was at this time\nunbounded; and he could not appear among his soldiers\nwithout such demonstrations of enthusiastic a\ufb00ection as\nfew commanders have ever received. On the \ufb01rst of\nNovember he succeeded General Scott in the command of\nall the armies of the Union, still retaining personal\ncommand of the Army of the Potomac; but he seemed to be\nunable to move. Cautious, hesitating, always \ufb01nding fresh\nobstacles to a movement, he permitted the golden days of\nautumn to pass away. In the meantime, the government was\nurging him to do something, as the rebel forces were\nmassing in his front, and the country was clamorous for\naction. Instead of holding the commanding General\nresponsible for these delays, the country blamed the\ngovernment, and manifested its dissatisfaction by its votes\nin the fall elections.\nAll that autumn passed away, and not a blow was struck.\nThe Potomac was closed to government war vessels and\ntransports, by a few batteries which the over-cautious\nGeneral was afraid to touch.\nMr. Lincoln was determined to break the spell which\nseemed to hold the General\u2019s mind; and, on the twenty-\nseventh of January, he issued an order that on the twenty-\nsecond day of February, , there should be a general\n movement of the land and naval forces of the United States,\nagainst the insurgent armies \u2014 especially the army at and\nabout Fortress Monroe, the army of the Potomac, the army\nof \nWestern \nVirginia, \nthe \narmy \nnear \nMumfordsville,\nKentucky, the army and \ufb02otilla at Cairo, and a naval force\nin the gulf of Mexico. He further declared \u201cthat the heads\nof departments, and especially the Secretaries of War and\nof the Navy, with all their subordinates, and the General-in-\nChief with all other commanders and subordinates of land\nand naval forces, will severally be held to their strict and\nfull responsibilities for prompt execution of this order.\u201d On\nthe thirty-\ufb01rst of January \u2014 four days afterward \u2014 he\nissued another order, specially to the anny of the Potomac,\nto engage, on or before the twenty-second of February, in\nthe attempt to seize upon and occupy a point upon the\nrailroad south-west of Manassas Junction, the details of the\nmovement to be in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief.\nTo this last order of the President, General McClellan\nreplied in a long letter to the Secretary of War. He objected\nto the President\u2019s plan, that the roads would be bad at the\nseason proposed; and wished to substitute a plan of his\nown, which had in its favor a better soil for the moving of\ntroops. He wished to move by the Lower Rappahannock,\nmaking Urbana his base. He would throw upon the new line\nfrom one hundred and ten thousand to one hundred and\nforty thousand troops, according to circumstances, hoping\nto use the latter number, by bringing such fresh troops into\nWashington as would protect the capital. He \u201crespectfully\nbut \ufb01rmly\u201d advised that he might be permitted to make this\n substitution of his own for the President\u2019s plan. So \ufb01rm was\nhe that he was willing to say: \u201cI will stake my life, my\nreputation, on the result, \u2014 more than that, I will stake on\nit the success of our cause.\u201d His judgment, he declared,\nwas against the movement on Manassas. On the third of\nFebruary, Mr. Lincoln addressed a note to the General on\nthis di\ufb00erence of opinion; which ought to have shown him\nthat his superior was a competent adviser and a keen critic:\n\u201cMy dear Sir: \u2014 You and I have distinct and di\ufb00erent\nplans for a movement of the army of the Potomac; yours to\nbe done by the Chesapeake, up the Rappahannock, to\nUrbana, and across land to the terminus of the railroad on\nthe York River; mine to move directly to a point on the\nrailroad \nsouth-west \nof \nManassas. \nIf \nyou \nwill \ngive\nsatisfactory answers to the following questions, I shall\ngladly yield my plans to yours:\n\u201c. Does not your plan involve a greatly larger\nexpenditure of time and money than mine?\n\u201c. Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than\nmine?\n\u201c. Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than\nmine?\n\u201c. In fact, would it not be less valuable in this: that it\nwould break no great line of the enemy\u2019s communications,\nwhile mine would?\n\u201c. In case of disaster, would not a retreat be more\ndi\ufb00icult by your plan than mine?\u201d\nGeneral McClellan replied to this through the Secretary\nof War, after his fashion; but the President was not\n convinced, and \ufb01nally agreed to submit the two plans to a\ncouncil of twelve o\ufb00icers. This council, eight to four,\ndecided in favor of the General\u2019s plan. The President\nacquiesced; but the rebels rendered both plans useless by\nwithdrawing from Manassas on the ninth of March to the\nother side of the Rappahannock \u2014 which date will be seen\nto be two weeks later than the date \ufb01xed for the advance of\nall the armies by the President.\nOn the eighth of March, the President ordered General\nMcClellan to organize that part of his army which he\nproposed to engage in active operations, into four Army\nCorps, \nto \nbe \ncommanded \nrespectively \nby \nGeneral\nMcDowell, General Sumner, General Heintzelman and\nGeneral Keyes; and directed the order to be executed with\nsuch \ndispatch \nas \nnot \nto \ndelay \noperations \nalready\ndetermined on \u2014 alluding to the movement by the\nChesapeake and Rappahannock. On the same day, he\nissued another order: that no change of base should take\nplace without leaving in and about Washington such an\narmy as should make the city secure; that no more than two\narmy corps should move before the Potomac should be\ncleared of rebel batteries; and that the movement should\nbegin as early as the eighteenth of March.\nOn the next day, as has already been stated, the enemy\nretired unsuspected and undisturbed from his defenses;\nand then General McClellan moved forward, not to pursue,\naccording to his own authority, but to give his troops some\nexercise, and a taste of the march and bivouac, before more\n active operations. On the \ufb01fteenth, the army moved back to\nAlexandria.\nOn the eleventh of March, General McClellan was\nrelieved from the command of other military departments,\nbecause he had personally taken the \ufb01eld. Major-General\nHalleck received the command of the department of the\nMississippi, and General Fremont that of the mountain\ndepartment. On the thirteenth, a council of war decided\nthat, \nas \nthe \nenemy \nhad \nretreated \nbehind \nthe\nRappahannock, the new base of operations should be\nFortress Monroe, on certain conditions which touched the\nneutralization of the power of the Merrimac, (an iron plated\nrebel vessel which had already destroyed the frigates\nCumberland and Congress, and been beaten back by the\nMonitor,) means of transportation, and naval auxiliaries\nsu\ufb00icient to silence the batteries on York River. On the\nsame day, Mr. Stanton wrote to General McClellan, stating\nthat the President saw no objection to the plan, but\ndirecting that such a force should be left at Manassas\nJunction as would make it entirely certain that the enemy\nshould not repossess it, that Washington should be left\nsecure, and that, whatever place might be chosen as the\nnew base, the army should move at once in pursuit of the\nenemy, by some route.\nThe President was impatient for action. Not a blow had\nbeen struck. Back from the Potomac blockade, and back\nfrom Manassas, the enemy had been permitted to retire\nwithout the loss of a man or a gun.\n On the thirty-\ufb01rst of March, Mr. Lincoln ordered\nBlenker\u2019s division from the army of the Potomac to join\nGeneral Fremont, who had importuned him for a larger\nforce, and who was supported in his request by exacting\nfriends. In a note to General McClellan, he said,\u2014 \u201cI write\nthis to assure you that I did so with great pain,\nunderstanding that you would wish it otherwise. If you\ncould know the full pressure of the case, I am con\ufb01dent\nthat you would justify it.\u201d General Banks, who had been\nordered to cover Washington by occupying Manassas, was\nordered on the \ufb01rst of April to force General Jackson back\nfrom Winchester.\nTransportation had already been provided by the War\nDepartment for moving the troops to any new base that\nmight be determined on, and General McClellan was not\nobliged to wait. On the \ufb01rst of April, there were under his\ncommand, by the o\ufb00icial report of the Adjutant-general,\n, men in the four corps, with regular infantry and\ncavalry and other troops to raise the number to ,. In\nall the orders given by the President concerning the\nmovements of this army, there was one condition that he\ninsisted upon, viz, that troops should be left su\ufb00icient to\nprotect Washington; and by General McClellan\u2019s order only\ntwenty thousand e\ufb00ective men were to be left with General\nWadsworth, the military governor of the District. The force\nwas much smaller than was necessary, according to\nGeneral McClellan\u2019s previous calculations; and General\nWadsworth was so much impressed with its inadequacy\nthat he called the attention of the war department to the\n subject. The letter was referred to Adjutant-general\nThomas and General E.A. Hitchcock, whose decision was\nembodied in the words: \u201cIn view of the opinion expressed\nby the council of the commanders of army corps, of the\nforce necessary for the capital, though not numerically\nstated, and of the force represented by General McClellan\nas left for that purpose, we are of opinion that the\nrequirement of the President that this city shall be left\nentirely secure, not only in the opinion of the General-in-\nChief, but that of the commanders of all the army corps\nalso, has not been fully complied with.\u201d In the meantime,\nGeneral McClellan had gone forward to Fortress Monroe,\nand all but two corps of the troops had left for the new\nbase. When, therefore, Generals Thomas and Hitchcock\nmade their report, and the President saw that Washington\nwas about to be left without su\ufb00icient defense, he directed\nthe Secretary of War to order that one of the two corps not\nthen embarked should remain in front of Washington, and\nthat the other corps should go forward as speedily as\npossible. This was under date of April third. The \ufb01rst corps,\nunder \nGeneral \nMcDowell, \nwas \ndesignated \nfor \nthis\nprotective service, numbering , men. Two new\nmilitary departments were at once erected \u2014 the\nDepartment \nof \nthe \nRappahannock, \nunder \nGeneral\nMcDowell, and the Department of the Shenandoah, lying\nbetween the mountain department and the Blue Ridge,\nunder General Banks.\nGeneral McClellan pushed a portion of his troops toward\nYorktown at once \u2014 toward a line of intrenchments held by\n the enemy, stretching across the Peninsula. On the \ufb01fth of\nApril he wrote to the President, dating his letter \u201cNear\nYorktown,\u201d and stating that the enemy were in large force\nin his front, and that they apparently intended to make a\ndetermined resistance. At that time, the rebel force at that\npoint, according to subsequent reports by the rebels\nthemselves, did not exceed ten thousand men. No one\ndoubts now that General McClellan\u2019s cautiousness betrayed\nhis judgment, and that a strong and well-directed attack\nwould have swept the rebels out or their works.\nIn this letter, he began his long-continued complaint of\ninadequate force. He begged the President to reconsider\nhis order detaching the \ufb01rst corps from his command, as it\nwas his opinion that he should have to \ufb01ght all the available\nforce of the rebels, not far from the place where he was\nwriting. If he could not have the whole corps, he begged for\nFranklin and his division. On the sixth, Mr. Stanton replied\nthat Sumner\u2019s troops were on the way to him, that\nFranklin\u2019s division was on the advance to Manassas, and\nthat there were no means of transportation to send it\nforward in time for service in his operations. \u201cAll in the\npower of the government,\u201d added the Secretary, \u201cshall be\ndone to sustain you, as occasion may require.\u201d\nAnother day passed away; and, on the date of Mr.\nStanton\u2019s \ndispatch, \nGeneral \nMcClellan \nwrote \nagain,\nbegging for Franklin\u2019s division, complaining that he had no\nsu\ufb00icient transportation, and stating that the order forming\nnew departments deprived him of the power of ordering up\nwagons and troops, absolutely necessary for his advance on\n Richmond. He requested that the material he had prepared\nand necessarily left behind, with wagon trains, ammunition,\nand Woodbury\u2019s brigade, might be subject to his order. Mr.\nLincoln immediately telegraphed him that his order for\nforwarding what he had demanded, including Woodbury\u2019s\nbrigade, was not, and would not be interfered with,\ninforming him at the same time that he had then more than\none hundred thousand troops with him, independent of\nthose under General Wool\u2019s command. Mr. Lincoln closed\nhis dispatch with the words: \u201cI think you had better break\nthe enemy\u2019s line from Yorktown to Warwick River at once.\nThey will probably use time as advantageously as you can.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln, like the whole country, was convinced that\nthere was no such force behind those works as the fears of\nthe General had counted there; and it is now humiliating to\nlearn from the o\ufb00icial report of the rebel commander\nMagruder, that, \u201cwith \ufb01ve thousand men, exclusive of the\ngarrisons, we (they) stopped and held in check over one\nhundred thousand of the enemy.\u201d At Gloucester, Yorktown\nand Mulberry Island, he was obliged to put garrisons\namounting to six thousand men, and he had only \ufb01ve\nthousand men left to defend a line of thirteen miles. With a\nhundred thousand men at his back, General McClellan went\nto work with shovels to begin a regular siege. On the ninth\nof April, Mr. Lincoln wrote him a letter which is so full of\nwise counsel, kind criticism, and personal good-will, that it\ndeserves record here:\n\u201cMy Dear Sir \u2014 Your dispatches, complaining that you\nare not properly sustained, while they do not o\ufb00end me, do\n pain me very much.\n\u201cBlenker\u2019s division was withdrawn from you before you\nleft here; and you know the pressure under which I did it,\nand, as I thought, acquiesced in it \u2014 certainly not without\nreluctance.\n\u201cAfter you left, I ascertained that less than twenty\nthousand unorganized men, without a single \ufb01eld battery,\nwere all you designed to be left for the defence of\nWashington and Manassas Junction; and part of this even\nwas to go to General Hooker\u2019s old position. General Banks\u2019\ncorps, once designed for Manassas Junction, was diverted\nand tied up on the line of Winchester and Strasburg, and\ncould not leave it without again exposing the upper\nPotomac and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This\npresented, or would present, when McDowell and Sumner\nshould be gone, a great temptation to the enemy to turn\nback from the Rappahannock and sack Washington. My\nimplicit order that Washington should, by the judgment of\nall the commanders of army corps, be left entirely secure,\nhad been neglected. It was precisely this that drove me to\ndetain McDowell.\n\u201cI do not forget that I was satis\ufb01ed with your\narrangement to leave Banks at Manassas Junction: but,\nwhen that arrangement was broken up, and nothing was\nsubstituted for it, of course I was constrained to substitute\nsomething for it myself. And allow me to ask, do you really\nthink I should permit the line from Richmond, via Manassas\nJunction, to this city, to be entirely open, except what\nresistance could be presented by less than twenty thousand\n unorganized troops? This is a question which the country\nwill not allow me to evade.\n\u201cThere is a curious mystery about the number of troops\nnow with you. When I telegraphed you on the sixth, saying\nyou had over a hundred thousand with you, I had just\nobtained from the Secretary of War a statement taken, as\nhe said, from your own returns, making one hundred and\neight thousand then with you and en route to you. You now\nsay you will have but eighty-\ufb01ve thousand when all en route\nto you shall have reached you. How can the discrepancy of\ntwenty-three thousand be accounted for?\n\u201cAs to General Wool\u2019s command, I understand it is doing\nfor you precisely what a like number of your own would\nhave to do if that command was away.\n\u201cI suppose the whole force which has gone forward for\nyou is with you by this time. And, if so, I think it is the\nprecise time for you to strike a blow. By delay, the enemy\nwill relatively gain upon you \u2014 that is, he will gain faster by\nforti\ufb01cations \nand \nreinforcements \nthan \nyou \ncan \nby\nreinforcements alone. And once more let me tell you, it is\nindispensable to you that you strike a blow. I am powerless\nto help this. You will do me the justice to remember I\nalways insisted that going down the bay in search of a \ufb01eld,\ninstead of \ufb01ghting at or near Manassas, was only shifting,\nand not surmounting, a di\ufb00iculty; that we would \ufb01nd the\nsame enemy, and the same or equal intrenchments, at\neither place. The country will not fail to note-is now noting-\nthat the present hesitation to move upon an intrenched\nenemy is but the story of Manassas repeated.\n \u201cI beg to assure you that I have never written to you or\nspoken to you in greater kindness of feeling than now, nor\nwith a fuller purpose to sustain you, so far as, in my most\nanxious judgment, I consistently can. But you must act.\nYours, very truly, A. LINCOLN.\nThe President yielded to McClellan, and sent General\nFranklin to him, with his division; and General McClellan\nthanked him for his kindness and consideration, adding, \u201cI\nnow understand the matter which I did not before.\u201d\nCertainly his misunderstanding of the matter had not been\nthe result of any lack of e\ufb00ort on the part of the President\nto make him understand it. Through the whole month in\nwhich the great army lay before Yorktown, the President\nand War Department were fed with dispatches of the most\nencouraging character. General McClellan was leaving\nnothing undone to enable him to attack without delay; after\nreceiving reinforcements, he was \u201ccon\ufb01dent of results;\u201d he\nwas soon to be \u201cat them;\u201d there was to be \u201cnot a moment\u2019s\nunnecessary delay;\u201d he was \u201cgetting up the heavy guns,\nmortars and ammunition quite rapidly;\u201d there were heavy\nrains, and horrid roads, but he was \u201cmaking progress all\nthe time.\u201d He was making progress in the concentration of\ntroops, certainly, for, on the thirtieth of April, he had, by\nAdjutant-general Townsend\u2019s report, , men, of whom\n, were reckoned e\ufb00ective. At this time, he called\nupon the department for Parrott guns; and, on the \ufb01rst of\nMay, the President wrote him: \u201cYour call for Parrott guns\nfrom Washington alarms me \u2014 chie\ufb02y because it argues\ninde\ufb01nite procrastination. Is anything to be done?\u201d\n There was something to be done, but the enemy did it.\nAfter the absolute waste of a month\u2019s time, opportunities,\nand resources of strength and material, the rebels quietly\nevacuated their position, and retired up the Peninsula. It\nwas the old story of great preparations to \ufb01ght, and no\n\ufb01ghting \u2014 no weakening of the enemy. General McClellan\nthought the success brilliant, if we may judge by his\ndispatches. It was the costly victory of an engineer. He\ntelegraphed to Mr. Stanton, on the fourth, that he held the\nentire line of the enemy\u2019s works; that he had thrown all his\ncavalry and horse artillery, supported by infantry, in\npursuit; that no time should be lost, and that he should\n\u201cpush the enemy to the wall.\u201d The enemy retired to his\nsecond line of works at Williamsburgh without pushing, and\ntook his position behind the wall. Here was fought the\nbattle of Williamsburgh, which McClellan designated in his\n\ufb01nal report as \u201cone of the most brilliant engagements of\nthe war.\u201d He bestows the highest praise upon General\nHancock, though Hooker had fought with equal gallantry,\nand encountered greater losses. All did their duty; and\nwhen, between four and \ufb01ve o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\nGeneral McClellan arrived upon the ground (the battle\nhaving commenced early in the morning,) he did his duty,\nand helped materially toward a favorable result of the\naction. On the next morning, there was no enemy; and,\nowing to the bad roads, the lack of food, and the exhaustion\nof the troops, there could be no immediate pursuit.\nOn the seventh of May, General Franklin landed at West\nPoint with his division, further up the peninsula, supported\n by the divisions of Sedgwick, Porter and Richardson. The\nrebels were obliged to attack, to give the retreating\ncolumns from Williamsburgh time and opportunity to pass;\nbut, after a battle of six hours they were repulsed, though\nnot until they had accomplished their object.\nGeneral McClellan did not like the organization of the\narmy into corps. The measure did not originate with him,\nand the men appointed to their command were not men of\nhis choosing. He did not believe in \ufb01ghting the battle of\nWilliamsburgh. The three corps-commanders, Sumner,\nHeintzelman and Keyes, were all on the ground; and were\nregarded by the commanding General as indiscreet in\ncommencing the attack, and incompetent in its conduct.\nAt this time, Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Stanton and Mr. Chase\nwere all on a visit to Fortress Monroe; and, on the ninth of\nMay, General McClellan took occasion to write to the\nSecretary of War, asking permission to re-organize the\narmy corps. He wished to return to the organization by\ndivisions, or to be authorized to relieve incompetent\ncommanders of army corps. To give force to his request, he\ndeclared in his note that, had he been half an hour later on\nthe \ufb01eld, the army would have been routed, and would have\nlost everything. He declared that he found on the \ufb01eld \u201cthe\nutmost confusion and incompetency,\u201d and added that \u201cat\nleast a thousand lives were really sacri\ufb01ced by the\norganization into corps.\u201d Mr. Stanton replied that the\nPresident, who would write him privately, would give him\nliberty to suspend the corps organization temporarily, or\nuntil further orders. Mr. Lincoln wrote privately, and wrote\n a very frank and honest letter, dated at Fortress Monroe, of\nwhich these were the essential paragraphs:\n\u201cI have just assisted the Secretary of War in forming the\npart of a dispatch to you, relating to army corps, which\ndispatch, of course, will have reached you long before this\nwill. I wish to say a few words to you privately on this\nsubject. I ordered the army corps organization not only on\nthe unanimous opinion of the twelve Generals of division,\nbut also on the unanimous opinion of every military man I\ncould get an opinion from, and every modern military book,\nyourself only excepted. Of course I did not on my own\njudgment pretend to understand the subject. I now think it\nindispensable for you to know how your struggle against it\nis received in quarters which we cannot entirely disregard.\nIt is looked upon as merely an e\ufb00ort to pamper one or two\npets, and to persecute and degrade their supposed rivals. I\nhave had no word from Sumner, Heintzelman and Keyes.\nThe commanders of these corps are of course the three\nhighest o\ufb00icers with you, but I am constantly told that you\nhave no consultation or communication with them, that you\nconsult and communicate with nobody but Fitz John Porter,\nand perhaps General Franklin. I do not say these\ncomplaints are true or just, but, at all events, it is proper\nyou should know of their existence. Do the commanders of\ncorps disobey your orders in anything?\n\u201cAre you strong enough, even with my help, to set your foot\nupon the neck of Sumner, Heintzelman and Keyes, all at\nonce? This is a practical and very serious question to you.\n After the receipt of this private letter, General McClellan\nconcluded not to make the change which seemed so\nessential; but he created two new corps, or \u201cprovisional\ncorps,\u201d which he placed respectively under the command of\nFitz John Porter and General Franklin, the men whom Mr.\nLincoln had mentioned as his favorites.\nLeaving the army to make its way toward Richmond,\nevents take us back to Fortress Monroe for a brief space,\nwhere the Washington dignitaries were consulting and\nwatching the progress of a\ufb00airs. Nothing could be done on\nthe James River, on account of the presence of the\nformidable Merrimac; and, in the meantime, Norfolk was\nheld by the rebels. It was desirable to take Norfolk; and an\nexpedition was \ufb01tted out at Fortress Monroe, under\ncommand of General Wool, for that purpose. To show how\nthis was done, and, at the same time, to illustrate the free\nand easy manner in which the President dealt with his\no\ufb00icers, we shall let Mr. Lincoln tell his own \u201clittle story.\u201d\nIn a subsequent conversation with Major General Gar\ufb01eld,\nhe said: \u201cBy the way, Gar\ufb01eld, do you know that Chase,\nStanton, General Wool and I had a campaign of our own?\nWe went down to Fortress Monroe in Chase\u2019s revenue\ncutter, and consulted with Admiral Goldsborough on the\nfeasibility of taking Norfolk by landing on the North shore\nand making a march of eight miles. The Admiral said there\nwas no landing on that shore, and we should have to double\nthe cape, and approach the place from the south side,\nwhich would be a long journey, and a di\ufb00icult one. I asked\nhim if he had ever tried to \ufb01nd a landing, and he replied\n that he had not. I then told him a story of a fellow in Illinois\nwho had studied law, but had never tried a case. He was\nsued, and, not having con\ufb01dence in his ability to manage\nhis own case, employed a lawyer to manage it for him. He\nhad only a confused idea of the meaning of law terms, but\nwas anxious to make a display of learning, and, on the trial,\nconstantly made suggestions to his lawyer, who paid but\nlittle attention to him. At last, fearing that his lawyer was\nnot handling the opposing counsel very well, he lost all his\npatience; and, springing to his feet, cried out, \u2018Why don\u2019t\nyou go at him with a capias or a surre-butter or something,\nand not stand there like a confounded old nudum-pactum?\u2019\n\u2018Now, Admiral,\u2019 said I, \u2018if you don\u2019t know that there is no\nlanding on the North shore, I want you to \ufb01nd out.\u2019\u201d\nContinuing his narrative, Mr. Lincoln said: \u201cThe Admiral\ntook the hint; and, taking Chase and Wool along, with a\ncompany or two of marines, he went on a voyage of\ndiscovery, and Stanton and I remained at Fortress Monroe.\nThat night we went to bed, but not to sleep, for we were\nvery anxious for the fate of the expedition. About two\no\u2019clock the next morning, I heard the heavy tread of Wool\nascending the stairs. I went out into the parlor and found\nStanton hugging Wool in the most enthusiastic manner, as\nhe announced that he had found a landing, and had\ncaptured Norfolk.\u201d\nThus Norfolk came into our possession on the ninth of\nMay; and on the eleventh the Merrimac was blown up by\ncommand of her own o\ufb00icers, releasing our navy from its\n long durance, though its passage up the James was\nrepulsed by a heavy battery at Drury\u2019s Blu\ufb00.\nGeneral McClellan was still busy with his dispatches. Of\nthe nature of these dispatches, we can judge by the replies\nof the President. Under date of May \ufb01fteenth, the latter\nwrites: \u201cI have done all I could, and can, to sustain you. I\nhoped that the opening of James River, and putting Wool\nand Burnside in communications with an open road to\nRichmond, or to you, had e\ufb00ected something in that\ndirection.\u201d For \ufb01ve days our army lay at Williamsburgh, on\naccount of bad roads, which roads the rebel army found it\nconvenient to pass with su\ufb00icient rapidity to place\nthemselves within the outer defenses of Richmond, a\ndistance of nearly forty miles. They were, at least, all\nacross the Chickahominy River.\nHead-quarters reached White House on the sixteenth.\nTwo days previously, the General had written the President\nthat he could bring only eighty thousand men into the \ufb01eld,\nand that he wanted every man the government could send\nhim. Mr. Stanton wrote him on the eighteenth that the\nPresident was unwilling to uncover the capital entirely, but\ndesired that he would extend his right wing to the north of\nRichmond, so that McDowell could communicate with him\nby his left wing. \u201cAt your earnest call for reinforcements,\u201d\nsaid Mr. Stanton, \u201che is sent forward to co-operate in the\nreduction of Richmond, but charged, in attempting this, not\nto uncover the city of Washington.\u201d General McClellan\nseemed to have no idea that the capital was in danger, and\nreplied to this that he wished McDowell to join him by\n water. He feared that he could not join him overland in\nseason for the coming battle, and complained that\nMcDowell was not put more directly under his command.\nOn the twenty-fourth of May, the President wrote, saying\nthat McDowell and Shields would move for him on the\nfollowing Monday, Shields\u2019 troops being too much worn to\nmarch earlier; and that they had so weakened their line\nalready that Banks, in the Shenandoah valley, was in peril,\nand had met with a serious loss. On the same day, Mr.\nLincoln was obliged, in order to save the capital, to\nsuspend McDowell\u2019s movement toward McClellan; for the\nrebel General Jackson had begun a desperate push for\nHarper\u2019s Ferry. Against this action of the President,\nMcClellan protested; and, on the twenty-\ufb01fth, the former\nwrote him a note, giving a full statement of the situation:\n\u201cYour dispatch received. General Banks was at Strasburg\nwith about six thousand men, Shields having been taken\nfrom him to swell a column for McDowell to aid you at\nRichmond, and the rest of his force scattered at various\nplaces. On the twenty-third, a force of seven thousand to\nten thousand fell upon one regiment and two companies\nguarding the bridge at Front Royal, destroying it entirely;\ncrossed the Shenandoah, and on the twenty-fourth,\nyesterday, pushed on to get north of Banks on the road to\nWinchester. General Banks ran a race with them, beating\nthem into Winchester yesterday evening. This morning a\nbattle ensued between the two forces, in which General\nBanks \nwas \nbeaten \nback \ninto \nfull \nretreat \ntoward\nMartinsburg, and probably is broken up into a total rout.\n Geary, on the Manassas Gap Railroad, just now reports that\nJackson is now near Front Royal with ten thousand troops,\nfollowing up and supporting, as I understand, the force now\npursuing Banks. Also, that another force of ten thousand is\nnear Orleans, following on in the same direction. Stripped\nbare, as we are here, I will do all we can to prevent them\ncrossing the Potomac at Harper\u2019s Ferry or above. McDowell\nhas about twenty thousand of his forces moving back to the\nvicinity of Front Royal; and Fremont, who was at Franklin,\nis moving to Harrisonburg: both these movements intended\nto get in the enemy\u2019s rear.\n\u201cOne more of McDowell\u2019s brigades is ordered through\nhere to Harper\u2019s Ferry; the rest of his forces remain for the\npresent at Fredericksburg. We are sending such regiments\nand dribs from here and Baltimore as we can spare to\nHarper\u2019s Ferry, supplying their places in some sort, calling\nin militia from the adjacent states. We also have eighteen\ncannon on the road to Harper\u2019s Ferry, of which arm there is\nnot one at that point. This is now our situation.\n\u201cIf McDowell\u2019s force was now beyond our reach, we\nshould be entirely helpless. Apprehension of something like\nthis, and no unwillingness to sustain you, has always been\nmy reason for withholding McDowell\u2019s forces from you.\n\u201cPlease understand this, and do the best you can with the\nforces you have.\u201d\nA few hours after this dispatch was sent, the President\nsent another, stating that the enemy was driving General\nBanks before him, and was threatening Leesburgh and\nGeary on the Manassas Gap Railroad; that the movement\n looked like a general and concerted one \u2014 such an one as\nhe would not make if he were acting on the purpose of a\nvery desperate defense of Richmond; and that, if McClellan\ndid not at once attack that capital, he would probably have\nto give up the job, and come to the defense of Washington.\nThis dispatch moved the General. General Fitz John\nPorter was sent to attack a rebel force near Hanover Court-\nHouse, which he did with favorable results. General\nMcClellan described it as a perfect rout of the enemy, at\nwhich \nthe \nPresident \nwrote \na \ndispatch, \nstating \nhis\ngrati\ufb01cation, but expressing his surprise that the Richmond\nand Fredericksburg Railroad was not seized again. On the\ntwenty-sixth, Mr. Lincoln informed General McClellan that\nBanks was safe at Williamsport. Still the General wanted\ntroops sent to him by water, still he wanted more troops,\nand still the President assured him, again and again, that\nhe was doing and would do for him everything he could do,\nconsistently with the safety of Washington.\nA movement was commenced on the twenty-\ufb01fth to cross\nthe Chickahominy; and, on the thirtieth and thirty-\ufb01rst, a\nbattle was fought, which resulted in such a repulse of the\nrebels, and such heavy losses to them as greatly to alarm\nRichmond, and impress upon the city the belief that an\nimmediate and fatal pursuit would be made by the federal\nforces. After the engagement, General McClellan crossed\nthe river, but found the roads so bad that artillery could not\nbe handled, and that pursuit was impossible; although the\nrebels had found it convenient to get back, and expected to\nbe pursued. The following day, General Heintzelman sent a\n reconnoitering party within four miles of Richmond,\nwithout \ufb01nding an enemy. Informed of this, General\nMcClellan ordered the force to fall back to its old position:\nand on the same day wrote to Washington that he only\nwaited for the river to fall, to cross over the rest of his\narmy, and make a general attack; and that the morale of his\narmy was such that be could venture much, not fearing the\nodds against him.\nMcClellan had met great losses by battle and disease;\nand the government did what it could for him, by placing\nunder his command the troops at Fortress Monroe, and by\nsending to him McCall\u2019s division of McDowell\u2019s corps. On\nthe seventh of June, the General wrote to the Secretary of\nWar that he should be ready to move as soon as McCall\nshould reach him, and McCall reached him on the tenth. On\nthat day, he had caught a rumor that Beauregard had\nreinforced the rebels in Richmond; and then he wanted\nsome of Halleck\u2019s army in Tennessee sent to him. The\nSecretary assured him that Beauregard and his army were\nnot in Richmond, but that Halleck would be urged to\ncomply with the request, so far as he could do so with\nsafety. The particular friends of McClellan were busy at this\ntime with suspicions and reports that the President and\nSecretary of War were trying to sacri\ufb01ce him; and, to put\nan extinguisher on this, Mr. Stanton wrote: \u201cBe assured,\nGeneral, that there never has been a moment when my\ndesire has been otherwise than to aid you with my whole\nheart, mind and strength, since the hour we \ufb01rst met; and,\nwhatever others may say, for their own purposes, you have\n never had, and never can have, anyone more truly your\nfriend, or more anxious to support you, or more joyful than\nI shall be at the success which I have no doubt will soon be\nachieved by your arms.\u201d\nWith a long series of dispatches in which General\nMcClellan quarrels with the relations which General\nMcDowell\u2019s troops held to his command, it is not necessary\nto burden these pages. The President wished to hold on to\nMcDowell\u2019s troops, and still have them assist McClellan. He\nhad sent McCall\u2019s division by water; but these were\ndirected to be posted so that they could unite with the\ncorps coming by land, and to be kept under McDowell.\nMcClellan saw in this arrangement only ambition on the\npart of McDowell; and, in one of his dispatches, wrote the\ngovernment: \u201cIf I cannot fully control all his troops, I want\nnone of them, but would prefer to \ufb01ght the battle with what\nI have, and let others be responsible for the results,\u201d which\nwas equivalent to saying that he would rather be whipped\nwithout McDowell\u2019s troops, under the circumstances, than\nbe victorious with them.\nOn the twenty-\ufb01rst, the General sent a dispatch to the\nPresident, saying that ten thousand men had been sent\nfrom Richmond to reinforce Jackson. Mr. Lincoln informed\nhim of the con\ufb01rmation of the news, and told him that it\nwas as good to him as a reinforcement of an equal number.\nThus the time passed away, while his army was wasting\nwith disease in the Chickahominy swamps, and he, with\nevery fresh dispatch, was just \u201cabout to move.\u201d He had lain\nthere a month; and the rebels thought it was time for him\n to move in the other direction. He saw the preparations,\nand, anticipating a defeat, he wrote to inform the\ngovernment that the rebel force before him was two\nhundred thousand strong, and that, in case of a disaster,\nthe responsibility could not be thrown on his shoulders.\nThis kind of talk troubled Mr. Lincoln. \u201cI give you all I can,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cand act on the presumption that you will do the\nbest you can with what you have; while you continue,\nungenerously, I think, to assume that I could give you more\nif I would.\u201d At this very moment as it appears by\nMcClellan\u2019s report, he had ordered supplies to a point on\nthe James River, to which he expected to retreat. On the\nafternoon of the twenty-sixth, the extreme right of the army\nwas attacked; and, from that time until the army had\nwheeled back to the James River, there was no rest. They\nfell back, \ufb01ghting every day, in\ufb02icting terrible losses on the\nenemy, and receiving sad punishment themselves. The\nGeneral\u2019s pen was busy still, as it might be, for he took no\npart in the engagements. If he had ten thousand fresh\ntroops, he could take Richmond, he thought; but, as it was,\nhe could only cover his retreat. He was not responsible for\nthe result; he must have more troops. \u201cIf I save this army\nnow,\u201d said he to the Secretary of War, \u201cI tell you plainly that\nI owe no thanks to you, or to any persons in Washington;\nyou have done your best to sacri\ufb01ce this army.\u201d Was ever\nsuch petulance, such insolence, borne with such patience\nbefore? The President wrote him: \u201cSave your army at all\nevents.\u201d The President would not blame him. \u201cWe protected\nWashington,\u201d said he, \u201cand the enemy concentrated on you.\n Had we stripped Washington, he would have been upon us\nbefore the troops sent could have got to you. Less than a\nweek ago, you noti\ufb01ed us that reinforcements were leaving\nRichmond to come in front of us. It is the nature of the\ncase, and neither you nor the government is to blame.\u201d\nGeneral McClellan called upon the President for a\nreinforcement of \ufb01fty thousand troops, to which Mr. Lincoln\nreplied: \u201cWhen you ask for \ufb01fty thousand men to be\npromptly sent to you, you surely labor under some gross\nmistake of fact. Recently, you sent papers showing your\ndisposal of forces made last spring, for the defense of\nWashington, and advising a return to that plan. I \ufb01nd it\nincluded, in and about Washington, seventy-\ufb01ve thousand\nmen. Now, please be assured that I have not men enough to\n\ufb01ll that very plan by \ufb01fteen thousand.\u201d Further on he says:\n\u201cI have not, outside of your army, seventy-\ufb01ve thousand\nmen east of the mountains. Thus the idea of sending you\n\ufb01fty thousand men, or any other considerable forces\npromptly, is simply absurd.\u201d He closed by assuring him that\nhe did not blame him for his disasters, asking that he would\nbe equally generous toward the government, and adjuring\nhim to save his army. It was absolutely impossible for the\ngovernment to send reinforcements at once, to enable\nMcClellan to assume the o\ufb00ensive. On the seventh of July,\nthe General, who seems to have had a penchant for giving\ngeneral advice to the government, found time to write a\nlong letter to Mr. Lincoln, telling him that he thought the\nwar should not look to the \u201csubjugation of the people of any\nstate, in any event.\u201d He would have no political execution of\n persons, no con\ufb01scation, and no forcible abolition of\nslavery; though it appears that he did not object to the\npractical abolition of slavery upon military necessity, and by\nmilitary means. \u201cA declaration of radical views, especially\nupon slavery, will rapidly disintegrate our present armies,\u201d\nsaid the General: but he did not seem to produce a\nprofound impression upon the mind of the Executive.\nThe President determined to ascertain, by personal\ninspection, the condition of the army; and, on the eighth,\nvisited General McClellan at Harrison\u2019s Landing. At this\ntime it was understood that the enemy was organizing his\nforces for an advance on Washington. It was the opinion of\nMr. Lincoln, and of the corps commanders, that the army\nshould repair to Washington, but General McClellan was\nagainst it. The army, he declared, ought not to be\nwithdrawn. It ought to be promptly reinforced, and thrown\nagain upon Richmond. He wanted the whole of General\nBurnside\u2019s command in North Carolina to help him. He\ndreaded the e\ufb00ects of a retreat upon the morale of his\narmy, although he had just tried it, and declared, in a\ndispatch of the eleventh, that the army was in \u201c\ufb01ne spirits.\u201d\nOn the thirteenth, the President wrote him that one\nhundred and sixty thousand men had gone with his army to\nthe Peninsula, and that, when he was with him, a few days\nbefore, he was informed that only eighty-six thousand\nremained, leaving seventy-three thousand \ufb01ve hundred to\nbe accounted for. After making all allowances for deaths,\nwounds and sickness, \ufb01fty thousand men were still absent.\nGeneral McClellan replied that , men were absent by\n authority. Here was a reinforcement at command worth\nhaving. Why did the General let them go? Why did he not\ncall them back?\nIt was determined at last to withdraw the army from the\nPeninsula, and the order found McClellan still protesting.\n\u201cThe true defense of Washington\u201d was just where he was.\nHe received the order to remove his sick on the second of\nAugust; but it was not until the twenty-third that General\nFranklin\u2019s corps started from Fortress Monroe, and not\nuntil the twenty-sixth that McClellan himself arrived at\nAlexandria. On the following day, he was ordered to take\nthe entire direction of the forwarding of the troops from\nAlexandria to assist General Pope, who, two months before,\nhad taken the consolidated commands of McDowell and\nFremont, the latter retiring at his own request, and being\nreplaced by Sigel. That portion of the army of the Potomac\nwhich arrived before McClellan, pushed o\ufb00 at once to\nreinforce Pope; but not a man that came afterwards took\nany part in those battles by which that General was driven\nback upon Washington. The dispatches by which he was\nurged, ordered, almost besought, to forward troops to the\nassistance of Pope, would \ufb01ll severa pages of this volume;\nand, when we know how promptly troops went forward\nbefore his arrival, it is impossible to \ufb01nd in his miserable\nexcuses for inaction anything but a disposition to\nembarrass Pope, and deprive him of success. It is a hard\njudgment, and a sad one to render; but it must be\nrendered, or the conclusion is inevitable that the General\nwas either incompetent to comprehend the emergency or\n afraid to meet it. It is impossible to \ufb01nd as apology for his\nfailure to act in this great necessity, that would not damage\nhis reputation as a military man.\nThe triumphant rebels moved up the Potomac with the\nevident intention of crossing and invading Maryland. No\ntime was to be lost. Under the representation that the army\nof the Potomac would serve under no commander but\nMcClellan, General Pope was relieved, and the former\nplaced in command of all the troops. On the fourth of\nSeptember, he commenced moving into Maryland for the\npurpose of expelling the rebel forces. Washington was in a\npanic, and the whole country was in a condition of the most\nfeverish excitement. Still he called for reinforcements. He\nwanted to uncover Washington again, and said that, \u201ceven\nif Washington should be taken,\u201d it \u201cwould not bear\ncomparison with the ruin and disaster that would follow a\nsingle defeat of this army.\u201d When that same army was\n\ufb01ghting Under Pope, it did not, apparently, impress him in\nthat way at all.\nThe battle of South Mountain was fought on the\nfourteenth, and, on the seventeenth, the battle of Antietam.\nThe rebels were whipped, and recrossed the Potomac,\nbroken and disheartened. General McClellan did not\npursue, owing to the condition of his army, one whole corps\nof which (Fitz John Porter\u2019s) had not been in the action at\nall; and, as if the habit of calling for reinforcements had\nbecome chronic, renewed his application for more troops.\nThere he remained, with no e\ufb00ort to follow up his victory.\nThe President was impatient, but, to be sure that he did no\n injustice to the General, he Visited the army in person, to\nascertain what its real condition was. The result was an\norder, issued on the sixth, for the army to move across the\nPotomac, and give battle to the enemy, or drive him south.\nThe President promised him thirty thousand new men, if he\nwould move across the river between the enemy and\nWashington. If he would prefer to move up the Shenandoah\nvalley, he could only spare him \ufb01fteen thousand. Then\nGeneral McClellan began to make inquiries, and call for\nshoes and other supplies; but he did not begin to move. A\nfew days afterward, the rebel General Stuart made a raid\ninto Pennsylvania, with a large cavalry force, keeping\nGeneral McClellan busy, and calling forth from him the\ncon\ufb01dent statement that the daring raiders would be\nbagged; but they went completely around the army, and\nescaped in safety. A note written to the General by Mr.\nLincoln, on the thirteenth, so well illustrates the situation\nat the moment, and, at the same time, betrays so fully his\nknowledge of a\ufb00airs and the intelligence of his military\ncriticisms, that it must be given entire:\n\u201cMy Dear Sir \u2014 You remember my speaking to you of\nwhat I called your over-cautiousness. Are you not over-\ncautious when you assume that you can not do what the\nenemy is constantly doing? Should you not claim to be at\nleast his equal in prowess, and act upon the claim?\n\u201cAs I understand, you telegraphed General Halleck that\nyou can not subsist your army at Winchester, unless the\nrailroad from Harper\u2019s Ferry to that point be put in working\norder. But the enemy does now subsist his army at\n Winchester, at a distance nearly twice as great from\nrailroad transportation as you would have to do, without\nthe railroad last named. He now wagons from Culpepper\nCourt-House, which is just about twice as far as you would\nhave to do from Harper\u2019s Ferry. He is certainly not more\nthan half as well provided with wagons as you are. I\ncertainly should be pleased for you to have the advantage\nof the railroad from Harper\u2019s Ferry to Winchester; but it\nwastes all the remainder of autumn to give it to you, and, in\nfact, ignores the question of time, which can not and must\nnot be ignored.\n\u201cAgain, one of the standard maxims of war, as you know,\nis, \u201cto operate upon the enemy\u2019s communications as much\nas possible without exposing your own.\u201d You seem to act as\nif this applies against you, but can not apply in your favor.\nChange positions with the enemy, and think you not he\nwould break your communication with Richmond within the\nnext \ntwenty-four \nhours? \nYou \ndread \nhis \ngoing \ninto\nPennsylvania. But, if he does so in full force, he gives up his\ncommunications to you absolutely, and you have nothing to\ndo but to follow and ruin him; it he does so with less than\nfull force, fall upon and beat what is left behind all the\neasier.\n\u201cExclusive of the water line, you are now nearer\nRichmond than the enemy is by the route that you can and\nhe must take. Why can you not reach there before him,\nunless you admit that he is more than your equal on a\nmarch? His route is the arc of a circle, while yours is the\nchord. The roads are as good on yours as on his.\n \u201cYou know I desired, but did not order you, to cross the\nPotomac below, instead of above, the Shenandoah and Blue\nRidge. My idea was, that this would at once menace the\nenemy\u2019s communications, which I would seize if he would\npermit. If he should move northward, I would follow him\nclosely, holding his communications. If he should prevent\nour \nseizing \nhis \ncommunications, \nand \nmove \ntoward\nRichmond, I would press closely to him, \ufb01ght him if a\nfavorable opportunity should present, and at least try to\nbeat him to Richmond on the inside track. I say \u2018try;\u2019 if we\nnever try, we shall never succeed. If he make a stand at\nWinchester, moving neither north nor south, I would \ufb01ght\nhim there, on the idea that, if we cannot beat him when he\nbears the wastage of coming to us, we never can when we\nbear the wastage of going to him. This proposition is a\nsimple truth, and is too important to be lost sight of for a\nmoment. In coming to us he tenders us an advantage which\nwe should not waive. We should not so operate as to merely\ndrive him away. As we must beat him somewhere, or fail\n\ufb01nally, we can do it, if at all, easier near to us than far\naway. If we cannot beat the enemy where he now is, we\nnever can, he again being within the intrenchments of\nRichmond. Recurring to the idea of going to Richmond on\nthe inside track, the facility of supplying from the side away\nfrom the enemy is remarkable; as it were, by the di\ufb00erent\nspokes of a wheel, extending from the hub toward the rim;\n\u2014 and this whether you move directly by the chord, or on\nthe inside arc, hugging the Blue Ridge more closely. The\nchord-line, as you see, carries you by Aldie, Haymarket,\n and Fredericksburg; and you see how turnpikes, railroads,\nand \ufb01nally the Potomac by Acquia Creek, meet you at all\npoints from Washington. The same, only the lines\nlengthened a little, if you press closer to the Blue Ridge\npart of the way. The gaps through the Blue Ridge I\nunderstand to be about the following distances from\nHarper\u2019s Ferry, to wit: Vestal\u2019s, \ufb01ve miles; Gregory\u2019s,\nthirteen; \nSnicker\u2019s, \neighteen; \nAshby\u2019s, \ntwenty-eight;\nManassas, thirty-eight; Chester, forty-\ufb01ve; and Thornton\u2019s,\n\ufb01fty-three. I should think it preferable to take the route\nnearest the enemy, disabling him to make an important\nmove without your knowledge, and compelling him to keep\nhis forces together for dread of you. The gaps would enable\nyou to attack if you should wish. For a great part of the way\nyou would be practically between the enemy and both\nWashington and Richmond, enabling us to spare you the\ngreatest number of troops from here. When, at length,\nrunning to Richmond ahead of him enables him to move\nthis way, if he does so, turn and attack him in the rear. But I\nthink he should be engaged long before such point is\nreached. It is all easy if our troops march as well as the\nenemy, and it is unmanly to say they cannot do it. This\nletter is in no sense an order.\u201d\nStill the government urged the General forward, and still\nhe had excuses for not going forward. His horses were\nfatigued, and had the sore tongue, he said; and the\nPresident could not forbear asking him what his horses had\ndone since Antietam that would fatigue anything. The\nGeneral did not like what the President said about his\n cavalry, and called out another note from Mr. Lincoln, who,\nunder date of October twenty-sixth, wrote him that if he\nhad done any injustice he deeply regretted it. He added:\n\u201cTo be told, after \ufb01ve weeks\u2019 total inactivity of the army,\nand during which period we had sent to that army every\nfresh horse we possibly could, amounting in the whole to\n,, that the cavalry horses were too much fatigued to\nmove, presented a very cheerless, almost hopeless prospect\nfor the future.\u201d On the \ufb01fth of November, the army had\ncrossed \u2014 just a month after the order to cross was given;\n\u2014 and, of course, the rebels had made all the needful\npreparations, either for battle or retreat.\nBut patience at Washington, tried long, and terribly tried,\nhad become exhausted; and, on the same day on which the\nGeneral announced the army all across the Potomac, an\norder arrived relieving him of his command.\nMilitary men will judge this remarkable campaign in the\nlight of their own science; but the civilian will read its\nhistory by the light of its results, and by the light of those\nlater magni\ufb01cent operations of Thomas in Tennessee, \u2014 of\nSheridan in the Shenandoah valley and near Richmond, \u2014\nof Sherman\u2019s march from Chattanooga through the heart of\nthe rebellion and up the Atlantic coast, with cities falling\nbefore and on either side of him as if swept by a tornado, \u2014\nand of Grant before Vicksburg, or in the Wilderness and at\nRichmond, capturing whole armies, and \ufb01nishing up a was\nso weakly begun. In the light of these operations, the\ncampaign of McClellan looks like the work of a boy or the\nplay of a man.\n With General McClellan\u2019s motives, the writer has no\ndesire to deal. That he became the favorite of men whose\nheart was not in the war, may well be considered his\nmisfortune. That he became the representative of the party\nopposed to the administration in its general policy, on all\nsubjects, was not inconsistent with his desire and\ndetermination to do his whole military duty. That he\nentertained and acted upon the determination to injure the\nadministration for political purposes, there is very little\nevidence; and there is absolutely no evidence that the\nadministration, through any jealousy of him, withheld its\nsupport from him, that he might be ruined and put out of\nits way. Such a supposition cannot live a moment in the\nlight of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s life. If there is one fact in McClellan\u2019s\ncampaign that stands out with peculiar prominence, it is\nthat both Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Stanton sent him every man\nthey could spare, consistently with the safety of the capital,\nby the General\u2019s own showing at \ufb01rst, and by the showing\nof events at last. On one side, we see the presumptuous\nvolunteering of general political and military advice, the\nunreasonable call for reinforcements when assured again\nand again that he had every man that could be given him,\nexpostulations against government orders, quarreling with\ngovernment arrangements, absolute criminations of the\ngovernment, \nunaccountable \nhesitations \nand \nboyish\nine\ufb00iciency; while, on the other, there were almost\nunbroken respectfulness, patience and toleration, ardent\ndesire for the best results, constant urgency to action,\nconstant sacri\ufb01ce of personal feeling and opinion, and a\n patent wish to do everything practicable or possible to give\nthe commanding General everything he wanted.\nThat General McClellan loved power, is evident; and it is\njust as evident that it was not pleasant to him to share it\nwith any one; but, on the whole, there is no evidence that\nhe was not a good, well-meaning, and patriotic man. The\ndi\ufb00iculty was that he was great mainly in his in\ufb01rmities. He\nwas not a great man, nor a great general. He was a good\norganizer of military force, and a good engineer; he was a\ngood theorizer, and wrote good English; he had that quality\nof personal magnetism which drew the hearts of his\nsoldiers to him; but he was not a man of action, of\nexpedients, of quick judgment, of dash and daring, of great,\nheroic deeds. He was never ready. There were many\nevidences that he held a theory of his own as to the mode\nof conducting the war, and that, independently of the\ngovernment, he endeavored to pursue it; but, even if he\ndid, his failure must always be regarded as mainly due to\nconstitutional \npeculiarities \nfor \nwhich \nhe \nwas \nnot\nresponsible.\nThis chapter should be concluded here, but space must\nbe taken for a very brief record of the immediately\nsucceeding fortunes of the army of the Potomac, and a\nhurried chronicle of the other military events of the year.\nOn the retirement of General McClellan, General Burnside\nwas placed in command of the army of the Potomac; and, at\nthe same time, the rebel army commenced falling back\nupon Richmond. On the fourteenth, the army left its camps,\nand marched for Fredericksburg, arriving there at about\n the same time with the rebel army. Burnside was obliged to\nwait for his pontoons, and it was not until the twelfth of\nDecember that he was ready to cross. Only a feeble\nresistance was made to his passage, but it was a worse\nthan fruitless procedure. The attempt to carry the hills was\na failure, and he was obliged to withdraw his army, with a\nloss of from ten thousand to twelve thousand men. This\ngave a sad \ufb01nishing up to the year\u2019s sad business, with this\nill-starred army.\nThe opening of the campaign of  found the\ngovernment with a newly created navy at its command. Mr.\nWelles, though reputed ine\ufb00icient, had accomplished what\nno other man had ever done in an equal space of time. Not\nonly were the southern ports e\ufb00iciently blockaded, but\nmaterials for formidable naval expeditions were prepared.\nGeneral Burnside, at the head of an expedition, captured\nRoanoke Island on the eighth of February, with three\nthousand prisoners; and subsequently engaged in other\nsuccessful movements on the coast and up the rivers of\nNorth Carolina. On the nineteenth of June, Charleston was\nattacked, without success. In the latter part of April, Forts\nJackson and St. Philip, below New Orleans, were assailed\nby the \ufb02eet under Commodore Farragut, and so far\ndisabled that they were passed. As a consequence, New\nOrleans tell into our hands, all the rebel troops \ufb02eeing the\ncity. This a\ufb00air was equally brilliant in its execution and\nimportant in its results, and encouraged the government as\nmuch as it distressed and discouraged its foes. Fort Pulaski,\n guarding the entrance to Savannah, was also taken, and\nthat port e\ufb00ectually shut up.\nWhile these much desired, though hardly expected,\nsuccesses attended the operations at the mouth of the\nMississippi, events of equal importance were in progress on\nits tributaries. At the West movements were on a gigantic\nscale. The capture of Forts Henry and Donelson on the\nCumberland River drew the enemy out of Bowling Green\nand Nashville, and gave us Columbus. General Price was\ndriven out of Missouri. Island Number Ten and Forts Pillow\nand Randolph all fell into our hands, and then our forces\noccupied Memphis. A combination of all the rebel armies at\nCorinth surprised our troops at Pittsburg Landing, under\nGeneral Grant, on the morning of April sixth, with\noverwhelming numbers, and drove them back to the\nprotection of our gunboats; but on the following day,\nthrough the opportune arrival of General Buell, with his\nforces, the rebels were pushed back into retreat, with\nterrible losses, leaving our victorious army almost as badly\npunished as themselves. The victory was so decided that\nMr. Lincoln was moved to issue a Proclamation of\nThanksgiving, in which he also recognized the other\nvictories that have been chronicled. The people were called\nupon to \u201crender thanks to our Heavenly Father for these\ninestimable blessings,\u201d and were also desired to \u201cimplore\nspiritual consolation in behalf of all those who have been\nbrought into a\ufb04iction by the casualties and calamities of\ncivil war.\u201d\n The rebels fell back to Corinth, and, remaining there a\nfew days, retired to Grenada. A powerful e\ufb00ort of General\nBragg to invade Kentucky, made later in the season, for the\npurpose mainly of gathering reinforcements, encouraging\nthe secession spirit, and collecting supplies, was a failure,\nin nearly every point; and, after a battle at Terryville, he\nretreated. General Rosecrans was attacked at Corinth by a\npowerful confederate force, but he repulsed the rebels with\ngreat loss. At the very last of the year, there was a severe\n\ufb01ght at Murfreesboro which resulted favorably to our arms;\nand the new year of  found a great advance made\ntoward the entire redemption of Kentucky, Tennessee and\nMissouri, from the presence of rebel armies and the\nprevalence of rebel in\ufb02uence.\n   ha ter   III.\nWHILE THESE OPERATIONS, pursued upon a most gigantic\nscale, for crushing the rebellion and defending the national\nexistence were in progress, Mr. Lincoln was taking every\nopportunity, personally and through his generals, to assure\nthe people of the South that he meant them no ill. No father\never dealt more considerately and carefully with erring\nchildren than he did with those who had determined to\nbreak up the government. On the twenty-\ufb01fth of July, he\nissued a proclamation, in pursuance of a section in the\ncon\ufb01scation act, passed by Congress a few days previously,\nwarning all persons to cease participating in the rebellion,\nand adjuring them to return to their allegiance to the\ngovernment, on pain of the forfeitures and seizures\nprovided by the act.\nThere had been men \u2014 and there continued to be\nthroughout the war \u2014 who believed, or pretended to\nbelieve, that peace and Union could be won without war \u2014\nthat friendly negotiation would settle everything. There\nnever was any basis for these fancies, except in rebel\ndesires to embarrass the government, or in party policy\namong those opposed to the administration, or in the\nhearts of simple men who believed that reason and\ncommon sense had a place in the counsels of the rebel\nleaders. From the beginning of the rebellion to the end,\n there was not a time in which peace could have been\nprocured, short of an acknowledgment of the independence\nof the confederate rebel states, as events have proved. Mr.\nLincoln understood this, and understood better than the\ncountry generally the desperate men with whom he had to\ndeal; yet he never repelled those who thought they had\nfound some way to peace besides the bloody way. Late in\n, a period which showed decided advantages won by\nthe Union forces, regarded as a whole, Fernando Wood, the\nman who, as Mayor of New York, had advocated the\nseparate secession of that metropolis and its erection into a\nfree city, wrote Mr. Lincoln a letter, stating that, on the\ntwenty-\ufb01fth of November, he was reliably advised that \u201cThe\nsouthern states would send representatives to the next\nCongress,\u201d provided that a full and general amnesty should\npermit them to do so. Mr. Wood urged his point with ardent\nprofessions of loyalty, and with arguments drawn from Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s inaugural; but Mr. Lincoln passed by his\narguments and exhortations, and, in a reply dated\nDecember twelfth, said that the most important part of his\n(Wood\u2019s) letter related to the alleged fact that men from the\nSouth were ready to appear in Congress, on the terms\nstated. \u201cI strongly suspect your information will prove to be\ngroundless,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln; \u201cnevertheless, I thank you\nfor communicating it to me. Understanding the phrase in\nthe paragraph above quoted, \u2018the southern states would\nsend representatives to the next Congress,\u2019 to be\nsubstantially the same as that \u2018the people of the southern\nstates would cease resistance, and would re-inaugurate,\n submit to, and maintain, the national authority, within the\nlimits of such states, under the Constitution of the United\nStates,\u2019 I say that in such case the war would cease on the\npart of the United States, and that if, within a reasonable\ntime, a full and general amnesty were necessary to such an\nend, it would not be withheld.\u201d\nMr. Wood thought the President ought to make an e\ufb00ort\nto \nverify \nhis \n(Wood\u2019s) \nstatement, \nby \npermitting \na\ncorrespondence to take place between the rebels, and\ngentlemen \u201cwhose former political and social relations with\nthe leaders of the southern revolt\u201d would make them good\nmedia for the purpose, the correspondence all to be\nsubmitted to Mr. Lincoln. The latter, however, knew Mr.\nWood, and knew that he bore no good-will to him, or his\nadministration, or the country; and he told him that he did\nnot think it would do any good to communicate what he had\nsaid to the South, either formally or informally, for they\nalready knew it. Neither did he think it the time to stop\nmilitary operations for negotiations. If Mr. Wood had any\npositive information, he should be glad to get it; and such\ninformation might be more valuable before the \ufb01rst of\nJanuary than after it. At this, Mr. Wood was \ufb01lled with\n\u201cprofound regret;\u201d and proceeded to read Mr. Lincoln a\nsolemn lecture on his Constitutional obligations, which,\ndoubtless, made a profound impression upon the mind of\nthe President, as he was not known, in a single instance, to\nbe unmindful of those obligations afterwards. The kernel of\nthis nut was in the words: \u201cYour emancipation proclamation\ntold of punishment. Let another be issued, speaking the\n language of mercy, and breathing the spirit of conciliation.\u201d\nMr. Wood was interposing on behalf of his southern friends,\nto prevent a \ufb01nal proclamation of emancipation; and he\nknew this was to come on the \ufb01rst of January, and that Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s allusion to that date was a gentle hint to him that\nthe executive purposes were undisturbed and that he was\nunderstood.\nBut we are getting ahead of great events which were\ndestined to have a radical in\ufb02uence upon the war, upon the\nsentiments and sympathies of Christendom, upon the social\ninstitutions of the country, and the destinies of a race. Mr.\nWood\u2019s allusion to the emancipation proclamation touched\na document and an event of immeasurable importance; and\nto these we now turn our attention.\nMr. Lincoln had tried faithfully, in accordance with his\noath of o\ufb00ice and his repeated professions, to save the\nUnion without disturbing a single institution which lived\nunder it. He had warned the insurgent states of a measure\ntouching slavery that their contumacy would render\nnecessary. He had besought the border slave states to take\nthemselves out of the way of that impending measure. He\nhad braved the criminations and the impatience of his\nfriends for his tenderness toward an institution which the\nConstitution protected. He had been accused of being\nunder the pro-slavery in\ufb02uence of the border states; yet,\nduring all this time, he had entertained the emancipation of\nthe slaves as a measure which would be almost sure to\ncome in time, and which he had determined should come\njust so soon as it could be justi\ufb01ed to his own conscience\n and to history, as a military necessity. In no other event\ncould he take this step, consistently with his oath.\nEmancipation was a measure of ine\ufb00able moment, and\none which dwelt in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s thoughts by day and by\nnight. By his own subsequent revelations, it was a measure\nwhich, upon his knees, he had presented to his Maker. The\nevents of the Peninsular campaign were connected in his\nmind with the tenacity with which he held to the\nunchristian institution. He sought not only for the people\u2019s\nwill upon the subject, but the will of God; and there is no\nquestion that he regarded the misfortunes of the army of\nthe Potomac as providentially connected with the relations\nof the government to the great curse which was the motive\nof the rebellion.\nFortunately, we have the record of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nreasoning upon the subject, in a letter which he wrote to\nMr. A.G. Hodges of Frankfort, Kentucky, April th, .\nMr. Hodges had previously had a conversation with him,\nand had requested him to put into writing the substance of\nhis remarks. The President complied; and, to show that he\nhad acted in his emancipation policy purely upon military\nnecessity, stated that, although he was naturally anti-\nslavery, and, could not remember when he did not think\nand feel that slavery was wrong, he never understood that\nthe presidency conferred upon him any right to act upon\nthat judgment and feeling. He understood that his oath of\no\ufb00ice forbade the practical indulgence of his abstract moral\nhatred of slavery. He had declared that, many times, in\nmany ways. But he shall say the rest in his own language:\n \u201cI did understand, however, that very oath to preserve\nthe Constitution to the best of my ability, imposed upon me\nthe duty of preserving, by every indispensable means, that\ngovernment \u2014 that nation of which that Constitution was\nthe organic law. Was it possible to lose the nation and yet\npreserve the Constitution? By general law, life and limb\nmust be protected; yet often a limb must be amputated to\nsave a life, but a life is never wisely given to save a limb. I\nfelt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might\nbecome \nlawful \nby \nbecoming \nindispensable \nto \nthe\npreservation of the Constitution through the preservation\nof the nation. Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and\nnow avow it. I could not feel that, to the beat of my ability, I\nhad even tried to preserve the Constitution, if, to preserve\nslavery, or any minor matter, I would permit the wreck of\ngovernment, country, and Constitution altogether. When,\nearly in the war, General Fremont attempted military\nemancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then think it\nan indispensable necessity. When, a little later, General\nCameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of\nthe blacks, I objected, because I did not yet think it an\nindispensable necessity. When, still later, General Hunter\nattempted military emancipation, I again forbade it,\nbecause I did not yet think the indispensable necessity had\ncome. When, in March and May and July, , I made\nearnest and successive appeals to the border states to favor\ncompensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable\nnecessity for military emancipation and arming the blacks\nwould come, unless averted by that measure. They declined\n the proposition; and I was, in my best judgment, driven to\nthe alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it\nthe Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored\nelement. I chose the latter.\u201d\nWith Mr. Lincoln\u2019s statement of the results of his action,\nwhich completes the letter, we have nothing at present to\ndo.\nWe have thus the political and military reasons for\nproclaiming emancipation in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s own language;\nand we are scarcely less fortunate in a record of his\npersonal struggles and feelings, made by Mr. F.B.\nCarpenter, who had the privilege of frequent intimate\nconversations with Mr. Lincoln, while he was employed at\nthe White House, upon his picture commemorative of a\nscene in the event itself.\nIt was mid-summer in , when, things having gone on\nfrom bad to worse, he felt that he must \u201cchange his tactics\nor lose his game.\u201d So, without consulting his cabinet, or\ngiving them any knowledge of what he was doing, he\nprepared the original draft of the Proclamation. Now it\nshould be remembered, in order to understand Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s \npeculiarity \nof \narguing \nagainst \nhis \nown\nconclusions, until his time should come for uttering them,\nthat this was before the date of his letter to Horace\nGreeley, already given to the reader, in which he gives no\nhint of his determination, but only lays out the ground upon\nwhich he should make it. It was also previous to a visit\nwhich he received from a body of Chicago clergymen, who\ncalled to urge upon him the emancipation policy. The\n proclamation was all written; and it was a full month after\nits utterance had been determined on in Cabinet meeting,\nwhen he told these clergymen: \u201cI do not want to issue a\ndocument that the whole world will see must necessarily be\ninoperative, like the Pope\u2019s bull against the comet.\u201d He\nwished them, however, not to misunderstand him. He had\nsimply indicated some of the di\ufb00iculties that had stood in\nhis way; but he had not decided against a proclamation of\nliberty to the slaves. \u201cWhatever shall appear to be God\u2019s\nwill,\u201d said he, \u201cI will do.\u201d Throughout this a\ufb00air, and indeed\nin all the great a\ufb00airs in which he took part, he followed\nthe old practice of his legal career, of arguing his\nopponent\u2019s side of the question \u2014 often for the simple\npurpose, evidently, of winning support for his own\nconvictions.\nSometime during the last of July, or the \ufb01rst part of\nAugust, he called a cabinet meeting. None of the members\nknew the occasion of the meeting, and for some time they\nwere unable to ascertain, for there was a delay. What was\nits cause? Here was an august body of men. All the cabinet\nwere present excepting Mr. Blair, who came in afterwards.\nMr. Lincoln had before him a document which he knew was\nto perpetuate his name to all futurity, \u2014 a document which\ninvolved the liberty of four millions of human beings then\nliving, and of untold millions then unborn, \u2014 which\nchanged the policy of the government and the course and\ncharacter of the war, \u2014 which revolutionized the social\ninstitutions of more than a third of the nation, \u2014 which\nbrought all the governments of Christendom into new\n relations to the rebellion, \u2014 and which involved Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s recognition of the will of the Divine Ruler of the\nuniverse. It was the supreme moment of his life. Did he feel\nit to be so? He did; and he took his own way of showing it.\nHe took down from a shelf a copy of \u201cArtemus Ward \u2014 His\nBook,\u201d and read an entire chapter of that literary\nharlequin\u2019s drollery, giving himself up to laughter the most\nhearty, until some of the digni\ufb01ed personages around him\nwere far more pained than amused. Little did those men\nunderstand the pressure of the occasion upon Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nmind, and the necessity of this diversion.\nA member of this noble and notable group has said that,\non closing the tri\ufb02ing volume, the whole tone and manner\nof the President changed instantaneously; and, rising to a\ngrandeur of demeanor that inspired in all a profound\nrespect, akin to awe, he announced to them the object of\nthe \nmeeting. \nHe \nhad \nwritten \na \nproclamation \nof\nemancipation, and had determined to issue it. He had not\ncalled them together to ask their advice on the general\nquestion, because he had determined it for himself. He\nwished to inform them of his purpose, and to receive such\nsuggestions upon minor points as they might be moved to\nmake. Mr. Chase wished the language stronger with\nreference to arming the blacks. Mr. Blair deprecated the\npolicy, because it would cost the administration the fall\nelections; but nothing was said which the President had not\nanticipated, until Mr. Seward said: \u201cMr. President, I\napprove of the proclamation, but I question the expediency\nof its issue at this juncture. The depression of the public\n mind consequent upon our repeated reverses is so great\nthat I fear the e\ufb00ect of so important a step. It may be\nviewed as the last measure of an exhausted government \u2014\na cry for help \u2014 the government stretching forth its hands\nto Ethiopia, instead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands\nto the government \u2014 our last shriek on the retreat.\u201d He\nfurther advised Mr. Lincoln to postpone the measure until it\ncould be given to the country supported by military\nsuccess, rather than after the greatest disasters of the war.\nMr. Lincoln admitted the force of the suggestion, and so\nthe matter was suspended for a brief period. This was\nbefore General Pope\u2019s retreat upon Washington, and the\ninvasion of Maryland; and during all these disasters the\nproclamation waited, though it was occasionally taken out\nand retouched. At last came the battle of Antietam, and the\nnews of national success met Mr. Lincoln at the Soldier\u2019s\nHome. There he immediately wrote the second draft of the\npreliminary proclamation, and came back to Washington on\nSaturday of that week, and held a cabinet meeting, at\nwhich he declared that the time for the enunciation of the\nemancipation policy could no longer be delayed. Public\nsentiment, he thought, would sustain it; many of his\nwarmest friends and supporters demanded it; \u201cand,\u201d said\nMr. Lincoln, in a low and reverent tone, \u201cI have promised\nmy God that I will do it.\u201d These last words were hardly\nheard by any one but Mr. Chase, who sat nearest to him.\nMr. Chase inquired: \u201cDid I understand you correctly, Mr.\nPresident?\u201d Mr. Lincoln replied: \u201cI made a solemn vow\nbefore God that, if General Lee should be driven back from\n Pennsylvania, I would crown the result by the declaration of\nfreedom to the slaves.\u201d\nThis statement was made by Mr. Chase to Mr. Carpenter,\nand does not di\ufb00er materially from one communicated to\nthe writer by Hon. George S. Boutwell of Massachusetts.\nMr. Boutwell, then in Washington, determined in October to\nvisit Massachusetts, and take a part in the state canvass;\nand previous to his departure he called upon Mr. Lincoln.\nIn the course of the interview, he told the President that an\nactive leader of the People\u2019s Party in Massachusetts had\nasserted, in a public speech, that Mr. Lincoln was\nfrightened into issuing the emancipation proclamation, by\nthe meeting of loyal governors at Altoona, Pennsylvania,\nwhich had occurred during the summer. \u201cNow,\u201d said the\nPresident, dropping into a chair, as if he meant to be at\nease, \u201cI can tell you just how that was. When Lee came\nover the river, I made a resolve that when McClellan should\ndrive him back, \u2014 and I expected he would do it some time\nor other, \u2014 I would send the proclamation after him. I\nworked upon it, and got it pretty much prepared. The battle\nof Antietam was fought on Wednesday, but I could not \ufb01nd\nout till Saturday whether we had really won a victory or\nnot. It was then too late to issue the proclamation that\nweek, and I dressed it over a little on Sunday, and Monday I\ngave it to them. The fact is, I never thought of the meeting\nof the governors at Altoona, and I can hardly remember\nthat I knew anything about it.\u201d\nOn \nMonday, \nthe \nd \nof \nSeptember, \n, \nthe\nproclamation was issued. Even from this sweeping measure\n he had left an opportunity to escape. It was only a\npreliminary proclamation. It only declared free the slaves of\nthose states and those sections of states which should be in\nrebellion on the st of January, , leaving to every rebel\nstate an opportunity to save its pet institution by becoming\nloyal, and doing what it could to save the Union:\n\u201cI, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of\nAmerica, and Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy\nthereof, do hereby proclaim and declare that hereafter, as\nheretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the object of\npractically restoring the constitutional relation between the\nUnited States and each of the states, and the people\nthereof, in which states that relation is or may be\nsuspended or disturbed.\n\u201cThat it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of\nCongress, to again recommend the adoption of a practical\nmeasure tendering pecuniary aid to the free acceptance or\nrejection of all slave states so-called, the people whereof\nmay not then be in rebellion against the United States, and\nwhich states may then have voluntarily adopted, or\nthereafter may voluntarily adopt, immediate or gradual\nabolishment of slavery within their respective limits; and\nthat the e\ufb00ort to colonize persons of African descent, with\ntheir consent, upon this continent or elsewhere, with the\npreviously obtained consent of the governments existing\nthere, will be continued.\n\u201cThat on the \ufb01rst day of January, in the year of our Lord\none thousand eight hundred and sixty-three; all persons\nheld as slaves within any state, or designated part of a\n state, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against\nthe United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and\nforever free; and the Executive Government of the United\nStates, including the military and naval authority thereof,\nwill recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons,\nand will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of\nthem, in any e\ufb00orts they may make for their actual\nfreedom.\n\u201cThat the Executive will, on the \ufb01rst day of January\naforesaid, by proclamation, designate the states and parts\nof states, if any, in which the people thereof respectively\nshall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the\nfact that any state, or the people thereof, shall on that day\nbe in good faith represented in the Congress of the United\nStates, by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a\nmajority of the quali\ufb01ed voters of such state shall have\nparticipated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing\ntestimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such state,\nand the people thereof, are not then in rebellion against the\nUnited States.\n\u201cThat attention is hereby called to an act of Congress\nentitled \u2018An Act to make an additional Article of War,\u2019\napproved March th, , and which act is in the words\nand \ufb01gures following:\n\u201c\u2018 Be \nit \nenacted \nby \nthe \nSenate \nand \nHouse \nof\nRepresentatives of the United States of America in\nCongress assembled, That hereafter the following shall be\npromulgated as an additional article of war for the\n government of the army of the United States, and shall be\nobeyed and observed as such:\n\u201c\u2018Article \u2014 All o\ufb00icers or persons in the military or naval\nservice of the United States are prohibited from employing\nany of the forces under their respective commands for the\npurpose of returning fugitives from service or labor who\nmay have escaped from any persons to whom such service\nor labor is claimed to be due; and any o\ufb00icer who shall be\nfound guilty by a court-martial of violating this article shall\nbe dismissed from the service.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018Sec. . And be it further enacted, That this act shall\ntake e\ufb00ect from and after its passage.\u2019\n\u201cAlso, to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled\n\u2018An Act to suppress Insurrection, to punish Treason and\nRebellion, to seize and con\ufb01scate Property of Rebels, and\nfor other purposes,\u2019 approved July th, , and which\nsections are in the words and \ufb01gures following:\n\u201c\u2018Sec. . And be it further enacted, That all slaves of\npersons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against\nthe government of the United States, or who shall in any\nway give aid or comfort thereto, escaping from such\npersons and taking refuge within the lines of the army; and\nall slaves captured from such persons, or deserted by them,\nand coming under the control of the government of the\nUnited States; and all slaves of such persons found on [or]\nbeing within any place occupied by rebel forces and\nafterwards occupied by forces of the United States, shall be\ndeemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their\nservitude, and not again held as slaves.\n \u201c\u2018Sec. . And be it further enacted, That no slave\nescaping into any state, territory, or the District of\nColumbia, from any other state, shall be delivered up, or in\nany way impeded or hindered of his liberty, except for\ncrime, or some o\ufb00ense against the laws, unless the person\nclaiming said fugitive shall \ufb01rst make oath that the person\nto whom the labor or service of such fugitive is alleged to\nbe due is his lawful owner, and has not borne arms against\nthe United States in the present rebellion, nor in any way\ngiven aid and comfort thereto; and no person engaged in\nthe military or naval service of the United States shall,\nunder any pretense whatever, assume to decide on the\nvalidity of the claim of any person to the service or labor of\nany other person, or surrender up any such person to the\nclaimant, on pain of being dismissed from the service.\u2019\n\u201cAnd I do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons\nengaged in the military and naval service of the United\nStates to observe, obey, and enforce, within their respective\nspheres of service, the act and sections above recited.\n\u201cAnd the Executive will in due time recommend that all\ncitizens of the United States who shall have remained loyal\nthereto \nthroughout \nthe \nrebellion, \nshall \n(upon \nthe\nrestoration of the constitutional relation between the\nUnited States and their respective states and people, if that\nrelation shall have been suspended or disturbed) be\ncompensated for all losses by acts of the United States,\nincluding the loss of slaves.\n\u201cIn witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and\ncaused the seal of the United States to be a\ufb00ixed.\n \u201cDone at the city of Washington, this tenth day of April,\nin the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and\nsixty-two, and of [L.S.] the Independence of the United\nStates the eighty-seventh.\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln.\n\u201cBy the President:\n\u201cWm. H. Seward, Secretary of State.\u201d\nIn the cabinet meeting held previous to the issue of the\nproclamation, Mr. Lincoln had concluded the reading of the\nthird paragraph, when Mr. Seward interrupted him by\nsaying: \u201cMr. President, I think that you should insert after\nthe word, \u2018recognize,\u2019 the words, \u2018and maintain.\u2019\u201d The\nPresident replied that he had fully considered the import of\nthe expression, and that it was not his way to promise more\nthan he was sure he could perform; and he was not\nprepared to say that he thought he was able to \u201cmaintain\u201d\nthis. Mr. Seward insisted that the ground should be taken,\nand the words \ufb01nally went in.\nThe proclamation was received with profound interest by\nthe whole country. The radical anti-slavery men were\ndelighted, conservative politicians shrugged their shoulders\ndoubtfully, and the lovers of the peculiar institution\ngnashed their teeth. It is very doubtful whether it a\ufb00ected\nthe fall elections so much adversely to Mr. Lincoln, as the\nfact that he was ignorantly or maliciously held responsible\nfor the blunders of McClellan\u2019s campaign. If it a\ufb00ected\nthem at all unfavorably, its in\ufb02uence in that direction soon\n ceased; and the proclamation became his tower of strength\nin the sight of his own people and the peoples of the world.\nTwo days after the issue of the proclamation, a large\nbody of men assembled before the White House with music,\nand called for the President. He appeared, and addressed\nto them a few words of thanks for their courtesy, and, in\nalluding to the proclamation, said: \u201cWhat I did, I did after a\nvery full deliberation, and under a heavy and solemn sense\nof responsibility. I can only trust in God I have made no\nmistake\u201d After two years of experience he was enabled to\nsay: \u201cAs a\ufb00airs have turned, it is the central act of my\nadministration, and the great event of the nineteenth\ncentury.\u201d\nIt will be remembered that General McClellan had\nwarned Mr. Lincoln against the e\ufb00ect of a general policy of\nemancipation upon his army. He thought that such a policy\nwould cause its disintegration. It certainly became a theme\nof angry discussion; \u2014 so much so that, on the seventh of\nOctober, the General felt called upon to issue an order\nreminding o\ufb00icers and soldiers of their relations and their\nduties to the civil authorities. It was an admirable order,\nand evidently well intended. \u201cDiscussion by o\ufb00icers and\nsoldiers concerning public measures, determined upon and\ndeclared by the government,\u201d said he, \u201cwhen carried\nbeyond the ordinary temperate and respectful expression of\nopinion, tends greatly to impair and destroy the discipline\nand e\ufb00iciency of the troops, by substituting the spirit of\npolitical faction, for the \ufb01rm, steady, and earnest support of\nthe authority of the government, which is the highest duty\n of the American soldier.\u201d If there was any fault to be found\nwith the order, it was connected with the time of its\npromulgation. It was issued the day after Mr. Lincoln left\nthe army, which, it will be remembered, he visited while it\nrested from the battle of Antietam. General McClellan had\nlearned something during that visit. He had learned that,\nnotwithstanding Mr. Lincoln\u2019s proclamation, he was held in\nstrong and enthusiastic a\ufb00ection by the army. For nearly a\nweek, he mingled with the weary o\ufb00icers and soldiers,\nmeeting the heartiest reception everywhere. A general\no\ufb00icer who was with the President on the trip, said: \u201cI\nwatched closely to if, in any division, or regiment, I could\n\ufb01nd symptoms of dissatisfaction, or could hear an allusion\nto the proclamation. I found none. I heard only words of\npraise.\u201d\nIt was undoubtedly the aim of traitors outside of the\narmy, and of their sympathizers within, to alienate the army\nfrom the President and the government; but they failed.\nOne Major Key came down from the army to Washington,\nwith the story that our Generals did not push the\nadvantages they had won, because it was not considered\ndesirable to crush the rebellion at once, if indeed, at all;\nbut so to manage a\ufb00airs as to secure a compromise as the\nresult of a prolonged war. It is quite probable that he had\nheard this talk among the leading o\ufb00icers, as he declared\nhe had. One thing was evident \u2014 that he agreed with their\npolicy; and, telling Mr. Lincoln plainly so to his face, he was\nat once removed from the service. The example served an\nexcellent purpose; and, with McClellan\u2019s order, and the\n e\ufb00ect of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s personal visit, brought the disloyal\nand factious elements of the army into their proper\nrelations to the government and its policy.\nOn the st of January, , the \ufb01nal proclamation of\nemancipation was issued, and the great act was complete.\nIt was as follows:\n\u201cWhereas, on the twenty-second day of September, in the\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two,\na proclamation was issued by the President of the United\nStates, containing, among other things, the following, to\nwit:\n\u201c\u2018That on the \ufb01rst day of January, in the year of our Lord\none thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons\nheld as slaves within any state or designated part of a\nstate, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against\nthe United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and\nforever free; and the Executive government of the United\nStates, including the military and naval authority thereof,\nwill recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons,\nand will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of\nthem, in any e\ufb00orts they may make for their actual\nfreedom.\n\u201c\u2018That the Executive will, on the \ufb01rst day of January\naforesaid, by proclamation, designate the states and parts\nof states, if any, in which the people thereof respectively\nshall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the\nfact that any state or the people thereof shall on that day\nbe in good faith represented in the Congress of the United\nStates, by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a\n majority of the quali\ufb01ed voters of such state shall have\nparticipated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing\ntestimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such state,\nand the people thereof; are not then in rebellion against the\nUnited States.\u2019\n\u201cNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\nUnited States, by virtue of the power in me vested as\nCommander-in-Chief of the army and navy of the United\nStates in time of actual armed rebellion against the\nauthority and government of the United States, and as a \ufb01t\nand necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion,\ndo, on this \ufb01rst day of January, in the year of our Lord one\nthousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and in accordance\nwith my purpose so to do, publicly proclaimed for the full\nperiod of one hundred days from the day \ufb01rst above\nmentioned, order and designate, as the states and parts of\nstates wherein the people thereof respectively are this day\nin rebellion against the United States, the following, to wit:\n\u201cArkansas, Texas, Louisiana (except the parishes of St.\nBernard. Plaquemine, Je\ufb00erson, St. John, St. Charles, St.\nJames, Ascension, Assumption, Terre Bonne, Lafourche, St.\nMarie, St. Martin and Orleans, including the city of New\nOrleans), Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South\nCarolina, North Carolina, and Virginia (except the forty-\neight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the\ncounties of Berkely, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City,\nYork, Princess Anne, and Norfolk, including the cities of\nNorfolk and Portsmouth), and which excepted parts are for\n the present left precisely as if this proclamation were not\nissued.\n\u201cAnd, by virtue of the power and for the purpose\naforesaid, I do order and declare that all persons held as\nslaves within said designated States and parts of States,\nare, and henceforward shall be free; and that the Executive\nGovernment of the United States, including the military\nand naval authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain\nthe freedom of said persons.\n\u201cAnd I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be\nfree, to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-\ndefense; and I recommend to them, that in all cases, when\nallowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.\n\u201cAnd I further declare and make known that such\npersons of suitable condition will be received into the\narmed service of the United States, to garrison forts,\npositions, stations and other places, and to man vessels of\nall sorts in said service.\n\u201cAnd upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of\njustice, warranted by the Constitution, upon military\nnecessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind,\nand the gracious favor of Almighty God.\n\u201cIn testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my name, and\ncaused the seal of the United States to be a\ufb00ixed.\n\u201cDone at the city of Washington, this \ufb01rst day of January,\nin the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and\nsixty-three, and of [L.S.] the Independence of the United\nStates the eighty-seventh.\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln.\n \u201cBy the President:\n\u201cWm. H. Seward, Secretary of State.\u201d\nA single paragraph in this proclamation was written by\nSecretary Chase. He had himself prepared a proclamation,\nwhich embodied his views, and had submitted it to Mr.\nLincoln. Mr. Lincoln selected from it this sentence: \u201cAnd\nupon this act, believed to be an act of justice warranted by\nthe Constitution [upon military necessity,] I invoke the\nconsiderate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of\nAlmighty God;\u201d and adopted it, interpolating only the words\nbetween brackets. It is an illustration of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nfreedom from vanity, \ufb01rst that he adopted the words at all,\nnotwithstanding their dignity and beauty; and, second, that\nhe freely told of the circumstance, so that it found publicity\nthrough his own revelations.\nOn the twenty-fourth of September, two days after the\nissue of the preliminary proclamation, Mr. Lincoln gave\nutterance to a proclamation suspending the writ of habeas\ncorpus. Proceeding from the fact that the ordinary\nprocesses of law were not su\ufb00icient to restrain disloyal\npersons from hindering the execution of a draft of militia\nwhich had been ordered, discouraging enlistments, and\ngiving aid and comfort in various ways to the insurrection,\nhe declared the writ of habeas corpus suspended, touching\nall persons who should be arrested, con\ufb01ned, or sentenced\nby court martial, for these o\ufb00enses. The measure created\ngreat dissatisfaction, particularly among those who were\nnot in favor of the war, and those who were anxious to\nmake political headway against the administration. There\n was an outcry against \u201cmilitary despotism,\u201d against the\n\u201cabridgment of the right of free speech,\u201d against the\n\u201csuppression of the liberty of the press,\u201d etc. etc.; the\nfreedom with which these strictures were made, without\nattracting the slightest notice of the government, refuting\nthe charges as rapidly as they were uttered.\nAt the succeeding session of Congress, these complaints\nhad immediate expression; and the proclamation was\nfuriously attacked at once. Resolutions were introduced,\ncensuring the \u201carbitrary arrest\u201d of persons in the loyal\nstates; and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus was\nvehemently \ndenounced. \nIt \nappeared \nby \nthese\ndemonstrations that the public liberty was endangered, and\nthat the Constitution was subverted. It is possible that\nsome of those engaged in this outcry were honest in their\nfears and denunciations; but some of them were notorious\nsympathizers with the rebels, and were doing, and had\ndone everything in their power to aid the rebellion. Nothing\nwas more notorious than that the country abounded with\nspies and informers, and men who discouraged enlistments,\nand counseled resistance to a draft. Congress, however,\nwas on the side of the government, and passed a bill\nsustaining the President, and indemnifying him and all who\nacted under him in the execution of his policy. It is quite\npossible that injustice was done in some of these \u201carbitrary\narrests\u201d \u2014 it would be strange, indeed, if it were otherwise\n\u2014 but the prophets of the degeneracy of the government\ninto a military despotism have their answer now, in the\npeaceful and ready return to the old status.\n There was one vice of the army that gave Mr. Lincoln\ngreat pain; and that was the unnecessary disregard of the\nSabbath. Armies, of course, cannot always be good\nSabbath-keepers; but he saw in them a disposition to do\nwork on that day not at all necessary, and to engage in\nsports quite in dissonance with its spirit. So, on the\nsixteenth of November, he issued a circular letter upon the\nsubject, in which he told the soldiers that \u201cthe importance\nfor man and beast of the prescribed weekly rest; the sacred\nrights of Christian soldiers and sailors, a becoming\ndeference to the best sentiment of a Christian people, and a\ndue regard for the Divine Will, demand that Sunday labor\nin the army and navy be reduced to the measure of strict\nnecessity.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe discipline and character of\nthe national forces should not su\ufb00er, nor the cause they\ndefend be imperiled, by the profanation of the day, or the\nname of the Most High.\u201d The letter shows how closely he\nhad associated the will of the Most High with the national\ncause, and how profound was his reverence for the\ninstitutions of Christianity.\nThis chapter, and the record of the events of the year,\ncannot be better closed, perhaps, than by an incident which\nshows that, in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s greatest necessity for popular\nsupport, he disdained, with all the strength of his old sense\nof justice and fairness, any trick for gaining that support.\nAfter New Orleans was taken, and a certain portion of the\nstate reclaimed and held by military power, movements\nwere commenced for the representation of the state in\nCongress. Mr. Lincoln was charged with conniving with this\n movement, and with intending to secure members of\nCongress from Louisiana, elected under military pressure,\nwho would assist in maintaining his policy, and make a\nshow of the returning loyalty of the state. On the twenty-\n\ufb01rst of November, he wrote to G.F. Shepley, the military\ngovernor of Louisiana, as follows:\n\u201cDear Sir \u2014 Dr. Kennedy, bearer of this, has some\napprehension \nthat \nFederal \no\ufb00icers, \nnot \ncitizens \nof\nLouisiana, may be set up as candidates for Congress in that\nstate. In my view, there could be no possible object in such\nan election. We do not particularly need members of\nCongress from those states to enable us to get along with\nlegislation here. What we do want is the conclusive\nevidence that respectable citizens of Louisiana are willing\nto be members of Congress, and to swear support to the\nConstitution; and that other respectable citizens there are\nwilling to vote for them and send them. To send a parcel of\nnorthern men here as representatives, elected as would be\nunderstood (and perhaps really so), at the point of the\nbayonet, would be disgraceful and outrageous; and were I a\nmember of Congress here, I would vote against admitting\nany such man to a seat.\u201d\n   ha ter    .\nTHE PEN HAS been so busy with the record of the great\nnational events with which Mr. Lincoln was directly\nconcerned, that no space has been found for entering the\nWhite House, and witnessing the kind of life that was lived\nthere. The closing paragraphs of the last chapter will give\nan intimation of some of the perplexities that attended Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s \ndaily \nexperience. \nMore \nthan \nany \nof \nhis\npredecessors was he regarded as the father of his people.\nHe was so accessible that they came to him with all their\ntroubles, from the represeptatives of the factions in\nMissouri, to the old woman who applied to him to have a\nsum of money reserved from the wages of a clerk in one of\nthe departments, that he might pay her bill for board.\nEvery man seemed to think that Mr. Lincoln could settle his\nlittle di\ufb00iculty, or provide for his little want, whatever it\nmight be. It was the story of his younger life re-enacted. He\nhad always been a reconciler of di\ufb00iculties between men;\nand he remarked, while in the presidential chair, that it\nseemed as if he was regarded as a police justice, before\nwhom all the petty troubles of men were brought for\nadjustment.\nIn one matter \u2014 and that an important one \u2014 he di\ufb00ered\nfrom all who had preceded him in his o\ufb00ice. Such an a\ufb00air\nas a genuine cabinet consultation hardly occurred during\n his administration. His heads of departments were heads of\ndepartments indeed. He intended that they should do the\nwork of their special o\ufb00ice, and that they should be held\nresponsible for it. The a\ufb00airs of state were managed by Mr.\nSeward, and not by Mr. Lincoln. The Treasury was almost\nas much in the hands of Mr. Chase, during his occupation of\no\ufb00ice, as if he were irresponsible to the head of the\ngovernment. The same fact held concerning all the other\nsecretaries. He was more intimate with the Secretary of\nWar, probably, than with any other member of the cabinet,\nbecause operations in the \ufb01eld were the leading a\ufb00airs of\ninterest and importance; and it is probable, also, that his\nin\ufb02uence was more felt in the war o\ufb00ice than in any other\nof the departments. Mr. Chase has said that he never\nattended a meeting of the cabinet without taking with him\nthe \ufb01gures that showed the exact condition of the Treasury\nat the time, and that, during the whole of his o\ufb00icial life, he\nwas not once called upon to show these \ufb01gures. Mr. Lincoln\ncontented himself with such knowledge as he gained in a\ngeneral way concerning the a\ufb00airs entrusted to him. The\ntenacity with which he clung to his chosen advisers and\no\ufb00icial family, throughout all the attempts of politicians and\nthe public to unseat them, was remarkable; and illustrated\nnot only the faithfulness of his friendship but the\nin\ufb02exibleness of his will.\nIf any action was ever taken by one of his secretaries\nthat seemed to him ill-advised, he did not hesitate to\ninterfere; but, sitting in his place, and performing what\nseemed to him to be his special duties, he intended that his\n associates in the government should sit in their places, and\nperform their duties; and he left them free to win such\nhonor as they could, by the administration of the a\ufb00airs of\ntheir respective departments.\nThe \ufb01rst three years of the war, with all their\nexcitements, responsibilities and anxieties, produced a\npowerful e\ufb00ect upon his physical constitution. He entered\nthe White House a healthy man, with a frame of iron; and,\nwithdut indulgence in a single debilitating vice, he became\na feeble man, weary and worn beyond the reach of rest.\nThe tired feeling very rarely left him. His relief was in\nstory-telling, \nin \nbooks \nof \nhumor, \nin \ntheatrical\nrepresentations, and in music. A lady who was, for a time, a\nmember of his family, related to the writer an incident\ntouching his love of music and its e\ufb00ect upon him. One\nevening he was prevailed upon to attend the opera. He was\nvery tired, and quite inclined to remain at home; but, at the\nclose of the evening\u2019s entertainment, he declared himself\nso much rested that he felt as if he could go home and work\na month. Simple heart-songs pleased him, however, much\nmore than the elaborate music of the opera. The poetry of\nBurns, and the class of verse to which it belonged, were\nsubjects of his special admiration; and the music that was\ntheir \ufb01tting expression was to him the most delightful of all.\nWith the soldiers who were \ufb01ghting the battles of the\ncountry, he had the deepest sympathy. Whenever he was\ncongratulated upon a success in the \ufb01eld, he never failed to\nallude gratefully to the noble men who had won it. The\ntrials of these men \u2014 their sacri\ufb01ces of comfort and health,\n of limb and life \u2014 touched him with a sympathy that really\nsapped the foundations of his constitution. They were\nconstantly in his thoughts; and not a battle was fought to\nwhose sacri\ufb01ces his own vitality did not contribute. He\nadmired the \ufb01ghting man, and looked upon him as, in one\nsense, his superior. Although he did not plead guilty to the\nweakness of moral cowardice, he felt that the battle-\ufb01eld\nwas a fearful place, from which, unaided by its special\ninspirations, he should run. Indeed, Mr. Lincoln did not give\nhimself credit for the physical courage which he really\npossessed, though he had probably grown timid with his\nfailing strength.\nThis sympathy with the soldiers he manifested in many\nways, and in none more than in his treatment of their\no\ufb00enses against military law. In a letter to the author, a\npersonal friend of the President says: \u201cI called on him one\nday in the early part of the war. He had just written a\npardon for a young man who had been sentenced to be\nshot, for sleeping at his post, as a sentinel. He remarked as\nhe read it to me: \u2018I could not think of going into eternity\nwith the blood of the poor young man on my skirts.\u2019 Then\nhe added: \u2018It is not to be wondered at that a boy, raised on\na farm, probably in the habit of going to bed at dark,\nshould, when required to watch, fall asleep; and I cannot\nconsent to shoot him for such an act.\u2019\u201d This story, with its\nmoral, is made complete by Rev. Newman Hall of London,\nwho, in a sermon preached after and upon Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\ndeath, says that the dead body of this youth was found\namong the slain on the \ufb01eld of Fredericksburg, wearing\n next his heart a photograph of his preserver, beneath which\nthe grateful fellow had written, \u201cGod bless President\nLincoln!\u201d From the same sermon, another anecdote is\ngleaned, of a similar character, which is evidently\nauthentic. An o\ufb00icer of the army, in conversation with the\npreacher, said: \u201cThe \ufb01rst week of my command, there were\ntwenty-four deserters sentenced by court martial to be\nshot, and the warrants for their execution were sent to the\nPresident to be signed. He refused. I went to Washington,\nand had an interview. I said: \u2018Mr. President, unless these\nmen are made an example of, the army itself is in danger.\nMercy to the few is cruelty to the many.\u2019 He replied: \u2018Mr.\nGeneral, there are already too many weeping widows in the\nUnited States. For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t ask me to add to the\nnumber, for I won\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201d\nWhole chapters might be occupied by the record of such\nincidents as these. The woe that the war brought upon the\npeople kept his sympathetic heart always bleeding. One of\nthe last acts of his o\ufb00icial life was the granting of a pardon\nfor a military o\ufb00ense. A friend from Illinois called to plead\nfor the life of a neighbor \u2014 a soldier who was on his way\nwith his regiment through Washington, and, falling out of\nthe ranks, entered a drinking saloon, was overcome with\nliquor, and failed to join his regiment before it left the city.\nHe was arrested for desertion, and sentenced to be shot.\nThe soldier\u2019s friend found Mr. Lincoln with a table before\nhim literally covered with documents, which were all to be\nsigned by him. There was not room enough on the table to\nhold the paper for a pardon. Mr. Lincoln heard the\n explanation of the case, and remarked: \u201cWell, I think the\nboy can do us more good above ground than under\nground;\u201d and then he proceeded to another table to write\nhis pardon. Afterwards, laughingly regarding the table from\nwhich the mass of papers had driven him, he said: \u201cBy the\nway, do ydu know how the Patagonians eat oysters? They\nopen them, and throw the shells out of the window, till the\npile gets higher than the house, and then they move!\u201d He\ncould not omit his \u201clittle story,\u201d even in a case of life and\ndeath.\nThere never lived a man more considerate of human\nweakness than Abraham Lincoln. He always found so many\napologies for the sins of others that he could cherish no\nresentments against them, even when those sins were\nmaliciously committed against himself. When his friends\nwent to him with the remarks of ill-natured and inimical\npersons, he preferred not to have them repeated, and\nturned o\ufb00 his indignant informers with a story, or the\nremark: \u201cI guess we won\u2019t talk about that now.\u201d He never\nread the public abuse of himself in the newspapers; and of\none of the most virulent attacks upon him he simply\nremarked that it was \u201cill-timed.\u201d Of one of his bitter\npolitical enemies, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve been told that insanity is\nhereditary in his family, and I think we will admit the plea\nin his case.\u201d Charity, pity, mercy, sympathy \u2014 these were\nvirtues which reigned in the White House during Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s occupation of it.\nYet Mr. Lincoln could be severe. Toward crimes resulting\nfrom sudden anger, or untoward circumstances and sharp\n temptations, \u2014 the long catalogue of vices growing out of\nhuman weakness, \u2014 toward these, he was always lenient;\nbut toward a cool, calculating crime against the race, or\nany member of it, from ambitious or mercenary motives, he\nwas severe. The systematic, heartless oppression of one\nman by another man, always aroused his indignation to the\nhighest pitch. An incident occurred soon after his\ninauguration which forcibly illustrates this point. Hon. John\nB. Alley of Lynn, Massachusetts, was made the bearer to\nthe President of a petition for pardon, by a person con\ufb01ned\nin the Newburyport jail for being engaged in the slave-\ntrade. He had been sentenced to \ufb01ve years\u2019 imprisonment,\nand the payment of a \ufb01ne of one thousand dollars. The\npetition was accompanied by a letter to Mr. Alley, in which\nthe prisoner acknowledged his guilt and the justice of his\nsentence. He was very penitent, \u2014 at least, on paper, \u2014 and\nhad received the full measure of his punishment, so far as it\nrelated to the term of his imprisonment; but he was still\nheld because he could not pay his \ufb01ne. Mr. Alley read the\nletter to the President, who was much moved by its\npathetic appeals; and when he had himself read the\npetition, he looked up, and said: \u201cMy friend, that is a very\ntouching appeal to our feelings. You know my weakness is\nto be, if possible, too easily moved by appeals for mercy,\nand, if this man were guilty of the foulest murder that the\narm of man could perpetrate, I might forgive him on such\nan appeal; but the man who could go to Africa, and rob her\nof her children, and sell them into interminable bondage,\nwith no other motive than that which is furnished by dollars\n and cents, is so much worse than the most depraved\nmurderer, that he can never receive pardon at my hands.\nNo! He may rot in jail before he shall have liberty by any\nact of mine.\u201d A sudden crime, committed under strong\ntemptation, was venial in his eyes, on evidence of\nrepentance; but the calculating, mercenary crime of man-\nstealing and man-selling, with all the cruelties that are\nessential accompaniments of the business, could win from\nhim, as an o\ufb00icer of the people, no pardon.\nTwo ladies, wives of rebel o\ufb00icers imprisoned on\nJohnson\u2019s Island, applied for their release, with great\nimportunity, one of them urging that her husband was a\nvery religious man. As he granted their request, he said to\nthe lady who had testi\ufb01ed to her husband\u2019s religion: \u201cYou\nsay your husband is a religious man: tell him, when you\nmeet him, that I say I am not much of a judge of religion;\nbut that, in my opinion, the religion that sets men to rebel\nand \ufb01ght against their government, because, as they think,\nthat government does not su\ufb00iciently help some men to eat\ntheir bread in the sweat of other men\u2019s faces, is not the sort\nof religion upon which men can get to heaven.\u201d\nCertainly Mr. Lincoln\u2019s religion was very di\ufb00erent from\nthis. It was one which sympathized with all human sorrow;\nwhich lifted, so far as it had the power, the burden from the\noppressed; which let the prisoner go free; and which called\ndaily for supplies of strength and wisdom from the divine\nfountains. He grew more religious with every passing year\nof his o\ufb00icial life. The tender piety that breathed in some of\nhis later state papers is unexampled in any of the\n utterances of his predecessors. In all the great emergencies\nof his closing years, his reliance upon divine guidance and\nassistance was often extremely touching. \u201cI have been\ndriven many times to my knees,\u201d he once remarked, \u201cby the\noverwhelming conviction that I had no where else to go. My\nown wisdom and that of all about me seemed insu\ufb00icient\nfor that day.\u201d On another occasion, when told that he was\ndaily remembered in the prayers of those who prayed, he\nsaid that he had been a good deal helped by the thought;\nand then he added with much solemnity: \u201cI should be the\nmost presumptuous blockhead upon this footstool, if I for\none day thought that I could discharge the duties which\nhave come upon me since I came into this place, without\nthe aid and enlightenment of One who is wiser and\nstronger than all others.\u201d He felt, he said, that he should\nleave Washington a better man if not a wiser, from having\nlearned what a very poor sort of man he was. He always\nremained shy in the exposure of his religious experiences,\nbut those around him caught golden glimpses of a beautiful\nChristian character. With failing strength and constant\nweariness, the even temper of the man sometimes gave\nway, while his frequent experience of the faithlessness and\ncupidity of men made him at last distrustful of those who\napproached him.\nIn February, , Mr. Lincoln was visited by severe\na\ufb04iction in the death of his beautiful son Willie, and the\nextreme sickness of Thomas, familiarly called \u201cTad.\u201d This\nwas a new burden; and the visitation which, in his \ufb01rm faith\nin Providence, he regarded as providential, was also\n inexplicable. Why should he, with so many burdens upon\nhim, and with such necessity for solace in his home and his\na\ufb00ections, be brought into so tender a trial? It was to him a\ntrial of faith, indeed. A Christian lady of Massachusetts,\nwho was o\ufb00iciating as nurse in one of the hospitals, came\nin to attend the sick children. She reports that Mr. Lincoln\nwatched with her about the bedside of the sick ones, and\nthat he often walked the room, saying sadly: \u201cThis is the\nhardest trial of my life; why is it? Why is it?\u201d In the course\nof conversations with her, he questioned her concerning\nher situation. She told him she was a widow, and that her\nhusband and two children were in Heaven; and added that\nshe saw the hand of God in it all, and that she had never\nloved him so much before as she had since her a\ufb04iction.\n\u201cHow is that brought about?\u201d inquired Mr. Lincoln. \u201cSimply\nby trusting in God, and feeling that he does all things well,\u201d\nshe replied. \u201cDid you submit fully under the \ufb01rst loss?\u201d he\nasked. \u201cNo,\u201d she answered, \u201cnot wholly; but, as blow came\nupon blow, and all was taken, I could and did submit, and\nwas very happy.\u201d He responded: \u201cI am glad to hear you say\nthat. Your experience will help me to bear my a\ufb04ictions.\u201d\nOn being assured that many Christians were praying for\nhim on the morning of the funeral, he wiped away the tears\nthat sprang in his eyes, and said: \u201cI am glad to hear that. I\nwant them to pray for me. I need their prayers.\u201d As he was\ngoing out to the burial, the good lady expressed her\nsympathy with him. He thanked her gently, and said: \u201cI will\ntry to go to God with my sorrows.\u201d A few days afterward,\nshe asked him if he could trust God. He replied: \u201cI think I\n can, and I will try. I wish I had that childlike faith you speak\nof, and I trust He will give it to me.\u201d And then he spoke of\nhis mother, whom so many years before he had committed\nto the dust among the wilds of Indiana. In this hour of his\ngreat trial, the memory of her who had held him upon her\nbosom, and soothed his childish griefs, came back to him\nwith tenderest recollections. \u201cI remember her prayers,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cand they have always followed me. They have\nclung to me all my life.\u201d\nThis lady was with the President on subsequent\noccasions. After the second defeat at Bull Run, he appeared\nvery much distressed about the number of killed and\nwounded, and said: \u201cI have done the best I could. I have\nasked God to guide me, and now I must leave the event\nwith him.\u201d On another occasion, having been made\nacquainted with the fact that a great battle was in\nprogress, at a distant but important point, he came into the\nroom where the lady was engaged in nursing a member of\nthe family, looking worn and haggard, and saying that he\nwas so anxious that he could eat nothing. The possibility of\ndefeat depressed him greatly; but the lady told him he must\ntrust, and that he could at least pray. \u201cYes,\u201d said he, and\ntaking up a Bible, he started for his room. Could all the\npeople of the nation have overheard the earnest petition\nthat went up from that inner chamber, as it reached the\nears of the nurse, they would have fallen upon their knees\nwith tearful and reverential sympathy. At one o\u2019clock in the\nafternoon, a telegram reached him announcing a Union\nvictory; and then he came directly to the room, his face\n beaming with joy, saying: \u201cGood news! Good news! The\nvictory is ours, and God is good.\u201d \u201cNothing like prayer,\u201d\nsuggested the pious lady, who traced a direct connection\nbetween the event and the prayer which preceded it. \u201cYes\nthere is,\u201d he replied\u2014 \u201cpraise: \u2014 prayer and praise.\u201d The\ngood lady who communicates these incidents closes them\nwith the words: \u201cI do believe he was a true Christian,\nthough he had very little con\ufb01dence in himself.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln always manifested a strong interest in the\npeculiar work of the Christian Commission in the army, and\nattended \nthe \nimportant \nmeetings \nof \nthat \nbody \nat\nWashington. His o\ufb00icial and personal approval of the plan\nof this charity was one of the greatest encouragements of\nthose engaged in the work. In the early part of , a\nmeeting of the commission was held, at which Mr. Lincoln\nwas a deeply interested spectator. He was particularly\nmoved on this occasion by the remarks of Chaplain\nMcCabe, just released from Libby prison, at Richmond, who\ndescribed, in a graphic manner, the scene among the\nprisoners on the reception of the news of the national\nvictory at Gettysburg, as they took up Mrs. Howe\u2019s spirited\nlyric, beginning with the line,\n\u201cMine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the\nLord,\u201d\nand made the prison walls rock with the melody. The\nChaplain sang it to the meeting, and Mr. Lincoln requested\nits repetition. That was a song that he could appreciate;\nand it stirred him like a trumpet.\n At another of these meetings, he was greatly interested\nand amused by a story told by General Fisk of Missouri.\nThe General had begun his military life as a Colonel; and,\nwhen he raised his regiment in Missouri, he proposed to his\nmen that he should do all the swearing of the regiment.\nThey assented; and for months no instance was known of\nthe violation of the promise. The Colonel had a teamster\nnamed John Todd, who, as roads were not always the best,\nhad some di\ufb00iculty in commanding his temper and his\ntongue. John happened to be driving a mule-team through a\nseries of mud-holes a little worse than usual, when, unable\nto restrain himself any longer, he burst forth into a volley of\nenergetic oaths. The Colonel took notice of the o\ufb00ense, and\nbrought John to an account. \u201cJohn,\u201d said he, \u201cdidn\u2019t you\npromise to let me do all the swearing of the regiment?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I did, Colonel,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut the fact was the\nswearing had to be done then, or not at all, and you weren\u2019t\nthere to do it.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln enjoyed this story quite as much as he did\nthe singing of the previous occasion, and gave himself up to\nlaughter the most boisterous. The next morning, General\nFisk attended the reception at the White House; and saw,\nwaiting in the ante-room, a poor old man from Tennessee.\nSitting down beside him, he inquired his errand; and\nlearned that he had been waiting three or four days to get\nan audience, and that on his seeing Mr. Lincoln probably\ndepended the life of his son, who was under sentence of\ndeath for some military o\ufb00ense. General Fisk wrote his\ncase in outline on a card, and sent it in, with a special\n request that the President would see the man. In a\nmoment, the order came; and past senators, governors and\ngenerals, waiting impatiently, the old man went into the\nPresident\u2019s presence. He showed Mr. Lincoln his papers;\nand he, on taking them, said he would look into the case,\nand give him the result on the following day. The old man,\nin an agony of apprehension, looked up into the President\u2019s\nsympathetic face, and actually cried out: \u201cTomorrow may\nbe too late! My son is under sentence of death! The\ndecision ought to be made now!\u201d and the streaming tears\ntold how much he was moved. \u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Lincoln,\n\u201cwait a bit, and I\u2019ll tell you a story;\u201d and then he told the\nold man General Fisk\u2019s story about the swearing driver;\nand, as he told it, the old man forgot his boy, and both the\nPresident and his listener had a hearty laugh together at its\nconclusion. Then he wrote a few words which the old man\nread, and in which he found new oocasion for tears; but the\ntears were tears of joy, for the words saved the life of his\nson.\nOnly a few months before Mr. Lincoln died, he was\nwaited upon at the White House by about two hundred\nmembers of the commission, who had been holding their\nannual meeting. The chairman of the commission, George\nH. Stuart, addressed a few words to Mr. Lincoln, speaking\nof the debt which the country owed him. \u201cMy friends,\u201d said\nMr. Lincoln in reply, \u201cyou owe me no gratitude for what I\nhave done: and I\u2014\u201d and here he hesitated, and the long\narm came through the air awkwardly, as if he might be\nmisunderstood in what he was going to say,\u2014 \u201cand I, I may\n say, owe you no gratitude for what you have done; just as,\nin a sense, we owe no gratitude to the men who have\nfought our battles for us. I trust that this has all been for us\na work of duty;\u201d and at the mention of that word, the\nhomely, sad face was irradiated with the light of a divine\nemotion. Looking around for encouragement into the faces\nof the eager group, he then proceeded in the simplest\nwords to say that all gratitude was due to the Great Giver\nof all good. At the close of his remarks, Mr. Stuart, who\ncared as little for precedent as Mr. Lincoln himself, asked\nhim if he had any objection, then and there, to a word of\nprayer. Quietly, but very cordially, as if he were grateful for\nthe suggestion, he assented; and Bishop James o\ufb00ered in\nthe East Room a brief and fervent petition. It was a\nmemorable scene, which must always be reverted to with\ninterest by every Christian patriot.\nOn another occasion, when a number of the members of\nthe commission were holding an interview with the\nPresident, Rev. J.T. Duryea of New York referred to the trust\nthat they were encouraged to repose in the Providence of\nGod, and to the fact that appeal was so constantly made to\nit in the prayers of Christian people that even children were\ntaught to pray for the President in their simple morning\nand evening petitions. \u201cIf it were not for my \ufb01rm belief in\nan over-ruling Providence,\u201d responded Mr. Lincoln, \u201cit\nwould be di\ufb00icult for me, in the midst of such complications\nof a\ufb00airs, to keep my reason on its seat. But I am con\ufb01dent\nthat the Almighty has his plans, and will work them out;\nand, whether we see it or not, they will be the wisest and\n best for us. I have always taken counsel of him, and\nreferred to him my plans, and have never adopted a course\nof proceeding without being assured, as far as I could be, of\nhis approbation. To be sure, he has not conformed to my\ndesires, or else we should have been out of our trouble long\nago. On the other hand. his will does not seem to agree\nwith the wish of our enemy over there (pointing across the\nPotomac). He stands the judge between us, and we ought to\nbe willing to accept his decisions. We have reason to\nanticipate that it will be favorable to us, for our cause is\nright.\u201d It was during this interview that the fact was\nprivately communicated to a member of the commission,\nthat Mr. Lincoln was in the habit of spending an early hour\neach day in prayer.\nIt was during this interview, also, that, on some allusion\nbeing made to the unfriendly personal criticisms of the\npress, he said: \u201cIt has been asserted that we are conducting\nthe present administration in the interest of a party, to\nsecure a re-election. It is said that appointments in the\narmy are made with this view, and that the removals are\nintended to put promising rivals out of the way. Now, if any\nman shows himself to be able to save the country, he shall\nhave my hearty support. If he wants to be president, he\nought to be, and I will help him. The charge is absurd.\nWhat matters it who is chosen the next president, if there is\nto be no next presidency? What matters it who is appointed\npilot for the next voyage, if the ship is going down this\nvoyage?\u201d When allusion was made to the carping spirit of\nsome of the professed friends of the government, who,\n distinguishing \nbetween \nthe \nadministration \nand \nthe\ngovernment, condemned the former while pretending to\ndefend the latter, he said: \u201cThere is an important sense in\nwhich the government is distinct from the administration.\nOne is perpetual, the other is temporary and changeable. A\nman may be loyal to his government, and yet oppose the\npeculiar principles and methods of the administration. I\nshould regret to see the day in which the people should\ncease to express intelligent, honest, generous criticism\nupon the policy of their rulers. It is true, however, that, in\ntime of great peril, the distinction ought not to be so\nstrongly urged; for then criticism may be regarded by the\nenemy as opposition, and may weaken the wisest and best\ne\ufb00orts for the public safety. If there ever was such a time, it\nseems to me it is now.\u201d\nAn illustration of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s interest in the e\ufb00orts of\nreligious men, is found in his treatment of a case brought\nbefore him by Rev. Mr. Duryea, whose name has already\nbeen mentioned. Colonel Loomis, commandant at Fort\nColumbus, on Governor\u2019s Island, was to be removed\nbecause he had passed the legal limit of age for active\nservice. His religious in\ufb02uence was so powerful that the\nChaplain of the post appealed to Mr. Duryea to use his\nin\ufb02uence for the good o\ufb00icer\u2019s retention in the service.\nAccordingly, appeal was made to the President for that\nobject, purely on religious grounds. \u201cWhat does Mr. Duryea\nknow of military matters?\u201d inquired Mr. Lincoln, with a\nsmile, of the bearer of his petition. \u201cNothing,\u201d replied the\ngentleman; \u201cand he makes no request on military\n considerations. The record of Colonel Loomis for \ufb01fty years,\nin the War Department, will furnish these. He asks simply\nto retain the in\ufb02uence of a man whose Christian character\nis pure and consistent, who sustains religious exercises at\nthe fort, leads a weekly prayer-meeting, and teaches a\nBible class in the Sabbath School.\u201d Mr. Lincoln replied:\n\u201cThat is his highest possible recommendation. Take this\npetition to the Secretary of War, with my approval.\u201d The\nresult was the retention of Colonel Loomis at his post, until\nhis services were needed in important court-martial\nbusiness.\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s habits at the White House were as simple\nas they were at his old home in Illinois. He never alluded to\nhimself as \u201cPresident,\u201d or as occupying \u201cthe Presidency.\u201d\nHis o\ufb00ice, he always designated as \u201cthis place.\u201d \u201cCall me\nLincoln,\u201d said he to a friend,\u2014 \u201cMr. President\u201d had become\nso very tiresome to him. \u201cIf you see a newsboy down the\nstreet, send him up this way,\u201d said he to a passenger, as he\nstood waiting for the morning news at his gate. Friends\ncautioned him against exposing himself so openly in the\nmidst of enemies; but he never heeded them. He frequently\nwalked the streets at night, entirely unprotected; and he\nfelt any check upon his free movements as a great\nannoyance. He delighted to see his familiar western\nfriends; and he gave them always a cordial welcome. He\nmet them on the old footing, and fell at once into the\naccustomed habits of talk and story-telling. An old\nacquaintance, with his wife, visited Washington. Mr. and\nMrs. Lincoln proposed to these friends a ride in the\n presidential carriage. It should be stated, in advance, that\nthe two men had probably never seen each other with\ngloves on in their lives, unless when they were used as\nprotection from the cold. The question of each \u2014 Mr.\nLincoln at the White House, and his friend at the hotel \u2014\nwas, whether he should wear gloves. Of course, the ladies\nurged gloves; but Mr. Lincoln only put his in his pocket, to\nbe used or not, according to circumstances. When the\npresidential party arrived at the hotel, to take in their\nfriends, they found the gentleman, overcome by his wife\u2019s\npersuasions, very handsomely gloved. The moment he took\nhis seat, he began to draw o\ufb00 the clinging kids, while Mr.\nLincoln began to draw his on. \u201cNo! no! no!\u201d protested his\nfriend, tugging at his gloves; \u201cIt is none of my doings: put\nup your gloves, Mr. Lincoln.\u201d So the two old friends were\non even and easy terms, and had their ride after their old\nfashion.\nLet us look a little deeper into this life in the White\nHouse. The writer has before him a private letter written\nby a lady of great intelligence and the keenest powers of\nobservation, from which he has the liberty to draw some\nmost interesting materials, illustrative of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nmode of dealing with men and women, and with the\nquestions which were presented to him for decision. They\nwill illustrate as well his weakness as his strength; and\nshow, better than any direct statement, how the duties of\nhis position had worn upon his nerves and his temper. The\nlady was the widow of one who had died while serving the\nsoldiers of the state of which he was the Governor; and she\n had taken up his work of charity, and pursued it from the\ntime of his death.\nThe lady says she was received by Mr. Lincoln after a\nbrief delay. He was alone, in a medium-sized, o\ufb00ice-like\nroom, with no elegance around him, and no elegance in\nhim. He was plainly clad in a suit of black, that \ufb01tted him\npoorly; and was sitting in a folded-up sort of way, in his\narm-chair. At his side stood a high writing-desk and table\ncombined; under his feet was a simple straw matting; and\naround him were sofas and chairs, covered with green\nworsted. Nothing more unpretending could be imagined. As\nshe entered, his head was bent forward, his chin resting on\nhis breast, and his hand holding the letter she had sent in.\nHe made a feint of rising; and, looking out from under his\neyebrows, said inquiringly: \u201cMrs. \u2014 ?\u201d Hastening forward,\nshe replied: \u201cYes, and I am very glad to see you, Mr.\nLincoln.\u201d He took her hand, and \u201choped she was well,\u201d but\ngave no smile of welcome. She had come on business which\ninterfered with his policy and plans; and she anxiously read\nhis face, full of its lines of care and thought, and almost\nstern in its expression. He motioned her to a chair; and,\nwhile he was reading her letter, she continued the perusal\nof his features. After he had \ufb01nished, he looked up, ran his\n\ufb01ngers through his slightly silvered brown hair, and with an\nair of sad severity said: \u201cMadam, this matter of northern\nhospitals has been talked of a great deal, and I thought it\nwas aettled; but it seems this is not the case. What have\nyou got to say about it?\u201d \u201cSimply this,\u201d she replied, \u201cthat\nmany soldiers, sick in our western army on the Mississippi,\n must have northern air, or die. There are thousands of\ngraves along the Mississippi and Yazoo, for which the\ngovernment is responsible \u2014 ignorantly, undoubtedly; but\nthis ignorance must not continue. If you will permit these\nmen to come North, you, will have ten men in one year\nwhere you have got one now.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln could not see the logic of this. Shrugging his\nshoulders, and smiling in his peculiar, quizzical way, he\nsaid: \u201cIf your reasoning were correct, your argument would\nbe a good one. I don\u2019t see how sending one sick man North\nis going to give us ten well ones.\u201d The lady replied: \u201cYou\nunderstand me, I think.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said he, \u201cI understand\nyou; but if they go North they will desert, and where is the\ndi\ufb00erence?\u201d Her reply was: \u201cDead men cannot \ufb01ght, and\nthey may not desert.\u201d \u201cA \ufb01ne way to decimate the army!\u201d\nexclaimed the President. \u201cWe should never get a man back\n\u2014 not one \u2014 not one.\u201d \u201cPardon me,\u201d responded the lady,\n\u201cbut I believe you are mistaken. You do not understand our\npeople. They are as true and as loyal to the government as\nyourself. The loyalty is among the common soldiers, and\nthey are the chief su\ufb00erers.\u201d Almost contemptuously Mr.\nLincoln replied: \u201cThis is your opinion!\u201d\nThe reader will see in this exhibition of petulance,\nevidence that the Preaident was conscious of being\nundermined in his predeterminations. \u201cMrs. \u2014 ,\u201d said he,\nearnestly, \u201cHow many men of the army of the Potomac do\nyou suppose the government was paying at the battle of\nAntietam? and how many men do you suppose could be got\nfor active service at that time?\u201d She replied: \u201cI know\n nothing of the army of the Potomac, except that it has made\nsome noble sacri\ufb01ces.\u201d \u201cWell, but give a guess,\u201d persisted\nthe President. \u201cIndeed, I cannot,\u201d was her answer. He\nthrew himself awkwardly around in his chair, with one leg\nover the arm, and spoke slowly: \u201cThis war might have been\n\ufb01nished at that time, if every man had been in his place\nwho was able to be there; but they were scattered here and\nthere over the North \u2014 some on furloughs, and in one way\nand another gone, so that, out of one hundred and seventy\nthousand men, whom the government was paying, only\neighty-three thousand could be got for action. The\nconsequences, you know, proved nearly disastrous.\u201d The\nPresident paused for a response, and it came. \u201cIt was very\nsad; but the delinquents were certainly not in northern\nhospitals, nor were they deserters from northern hospitals,\nfor we have had none: so your argument is not against\nthem.\u201d\nThe President appreciated this logic thoroughly, and\nreplied: \u201cWell, well; you go and call on the Secretary of\nWar, and see what he saYs.\u201d He then took the lady\u2019s letter,\nand wrote on the back: \u201cAdmit Mrs. \u2014 at once. Listen to\nwhat she saYs. She is a lady of intelligence, and talks sense.\nA. Lincoln.\u201d \u201cMay I return to you, Mr. Lincoln?\u201d she\ninquired. \u201cCertainly,\u201d said he, gently; and then the lady\nfound her way to Mr. Stanton\u2019s o\ufb00ice, and was listened to\nand treated with great respectfulness and kindness. She\nwas told by the Secretary that he had sent the Surgeon-\ngeneral to New Orleans, with directions to come up the\nriver, and visit all the hospitals. Mrs. \u2014 had no faith in\n these inspections, and told him so \u2014 told him, further, that\nno good to the western soldiers had ever resulted from\nthem. She also indicated what she believed to be the\nreasons for the favorable reports from the southern\nhospitals, that had uniformly been made. \u201cI believe,\u201d said\nshe, \u201cthat it is because the medical authorities know that\nthe heads of departments are opposed to establishing\nhospitals so far from army lines, and report accordingly. I\nwish this could be over-ruled. Can nothing be done?\u201d\n\u201cNothing until the Surgeon-general returns,\u201d he replied.\nPersonally, he expressed himself in favor of hospitals in\nevery northern state, but he had to be guided by the\nmedical authorities.\nShe bade him \u201cgood morning,\u201d and returned to the\nPresident. No one was waiting, and at the invitation of the\nmessenger she passed directly into the President\u2019s room.\nShe found a gentleman engaged in conversation with the\nPresident, but neither noticed her entrance. Taking a seat\nat a distance from the two gentlemen, she waited her\nopportunity. The visitor handed a paper to Mr. Lincoln. He\nlooked it over carelessly, and said: \u201c Yes, that is a su\ufb00icient\nindorsement for anybody: what do you want?\u201d The reply\nwas not heard; but the promotion of some person in the\narmy was strongly urged. She heard the sarcastic words\nfrom the applicant: \u201cI see there are no vacancies among the\nBrigadiers, from the fact that so many Colonels are\ncommanding brigades.\u201d\nAt this, the President threw himself forward in his chair\nin such a way as to expose to the lady the most curious,\n comical expression of features imaginable. He was looking\nthe man squarely in the face; and, with one hand softly\npatting the other, and the funny look pervading every line\nof his countenance, he said: \u201cMy friend, let me tell you\nsomething about that. You are a farmer, I believe; if not,\nyou will understand me. Suppose you had a large cattle-\nyard, full of all sorts of cattle \u2014 cows, oxen and bulls, \u2014\nand you kept killing and selling and disposing of your cows\nand oxen, in one way and another, taking good care of your\nbulls. By and by you would \ufb01nd out that you had nothing\nbut a yard full of old bulls, good for nothing under heaven.\nNow it will be just so with the army, if I don\u2019t stop making\nBrigadier-generals.\u201d\nThe man was answered, and he tried to laugh; but the\ne\ufb00ort was a feeble one. Mr. Lincoln laughed, however,\nenough for both parties. He laughed all over, and laughed\nhis visitor out of the room.\nThe lady stepped forward; and, as Mr. Lincoln motioned\nher to a chair, he inquired what the Secretary of War had\nsad to her. She gave him a full account of the interview, and\nadded: \u201cI have nowhere to go but to you.\u201d He replied, \u201cMr.\nStanton knows there is an acting Surgeon-general here,\nand that Hammond will not return these two months. I will\nsee the Secretary of War myself, to-night; and you may\ncome again in the morning.\u201d He then dismissed her in the\nkindest manner and with the kindest words.\nNo reader can doubt that from this moment he had\ndetermined to grant the lady her request; and this is to be\nremembered in the reading of the interviews which\n followed; for in these interviews occurred a strange\nexhibition of his penchant for arguing against and opposing\nhis own conclusions \u2014 in this case almost with temper \u2014\ncertainly not in the most amiable manner.\nIn the morning, the lady returned, full of hope, expecting\nto be greeted by the same genial face and cordial manner\nwith which Mr. Lincoln had dismissed her. The President\nraised his eyes as she entered his room, said \u201cgood\nmorning,\u201d and pointed to a chair. He was evidently annoyed\nat something which had occurred during some previous\nconversation of the morning, and waited for her to speak.\nShe waited for him. \u201cWell?\u201d said he, after a minute of delay.\n\u201cWell?\u201d replied his visitor. He looked up under his\neyebrows, a little startled, and inquired: \u201cHave you nothing\nto say?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d she replied, \u201cuntil I hear your decision.\nHave you decided? You know you bade me come this\nmorning.\u201d \u201cNo, I have not decided; and I believe this idea\nof northern hospitals is a great humbug, and I am tired of\nhearing about it.\u201d The lady pitied him in his weak and\nirritable mood, and said: \u201cI regret to add a feather\u2019s weight\nto your already overwhelming care and responsibility. I\nwould rather have stayed at home.\u201d With a feeble smile, he\nresponded: \u201cI wish you had.\u201d She was earnest, and replied:\n\u201cNothing would have given me greater pleasure, sir; but a\nkeen sense of duty to this government, justice and mercy to\nits most loyal supporters, and regard for your honor and\nposition, made me come. The people cannot understand\nwhy their husbands, fathers and sons are left to die, when,\nwith proper care and attention, they ought to live, and yet\n do good service for their country. Mr. Lincoln, I do believe\nyou will yet be gratefUl for my coming. I do not come to\nplead for the lives of criminals, nor for the lives of\ndeserters; but I plead for the lives of those who were the\n\ufb01rst to hasten to the support of this government, who\nhelped to place you where you are \u2014 for men who have\ndone all they could; and now, when \ufb02esh and nerve and\nmuscle are gone, who still pray for your life, and the life of\nthe republic. They scarcely ask for that for which I plead.\nThey expect to sacri\ufb01ce their lives for their country. I know\nthat, if they could come North, they could live, and be well,\nstrong men again, \u2014 at least, many of them. I say I know,\nbecause I was sick among them last spring, surrounded by\nevery comfort, with the best of care, and determined to get\nwell. I grew weaker and weaker, day by day, until, not being\nunder military law, my friends brought me North. I\nrecovered entirely by breathing northern air.\u201d\nWhile she was so earnestly speaking, Mr. Lincolns\nexpression of face changed often, but he did not take his\neyes from her. He was evidently distressed, for he was\nconvinced that she was speaking the truth. His face\ncontracted almost painfully as he said: \u201cYou assume to\nknow more than I do.\u201d The tears almost came in the lady\u2019s\neyes as she replied: \u201cPardon me, Mr. Lincoln, I intend no\ndisrespect; but it is because of this knowledge, and because\nI do know what you do not know, that I come to you. If you\nhad known what I know, and had not already ordered what\nI ask, I should know that an appeal to you would be in vain;\nbut I believe in you. I believe the people have not trusted\n you in vain. The question only is \u2014 do you believe me, or\nnot? If you believe in me, you will give us hospitals; if not \u2014\nwell.\u201d\n\u201cYou assume to know more than surgeons do,\u201d said Mr.\nLincoln, sharply. \u201cOh no,\u201d she replied; \u201cI could not perform\nan amputation nearly as well as some of them do. But this\nis true: I do not come here for your favor. I am no aspirant\nfor military favor or promotion. While it would be the pride\nof my life to command your respect and con\ufb01dence, still,\neven this I can waive to gain my object \u2014 waive for the\ntime. You will do me justice, some time. Now the medical\nauthorities know as well as you and I do, that you are\nopposed to establishing northern hospitals; and they report\nto please you. They desire your favor. I come to you from no\ncasual tour of inspection, having passed rapidly through\nthe general hospitals, with a cigar in my mouth and a ratan\nin my hand, talking to the surgeon in charge of the price of\ncotton, and abusing our generals in the army for not\nknowing and performing their duty better, and \ufb01nally\ncoming into the open air with a long-drawn breath as\nthough I had just escaped su\ufb00ocation, and complacently\nsaying to the surgeon: \u2018A very \ufb01ne hospital you have here,\nSir. The boys seem to be doing very well. A little more\nattention to ventilation is desirable, perhaps.\u2019 It is not thus\nthat I have visited hospitals. For eight long months \u2014 from\nearly morning until late at night, sometimes \u2014 I have\nvisited the regimental and general hospitals on the\nMississippi, from Quincy to Vicksburg; and I come to you\nfrom the cots of men who have died, and who might have\n lived if you had permitted it. This is hard to say, but it is\ntrue.\u201d\nWhile she was speaking the last sentences, Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nbrow had become severely contracted; and a pained, hard\nexpression had settled upon his whole face. Then he\nsharply asked her how many men her state had sent to the\n\ufb01eld. She replied: \u201cabout \ufb01fty thousand.\u201d \u201cThat means,\u201d he\nresponded, \u201cthat she has about twenty thousand now.\u201d With\nan unpleasant voice and manner he continued: \u201cYou need\nnot look so sober; they are not all dead.\u201d The veins \ufb01lled in\nhis face painfully, and one across his forehead was fearfully\nlarge and blue. Then, with an impatient movement of his\nwhole frame, he said: \u201cI have a good mind to dismiss them\nall from the service, and have no more trouble with them.\u201d\nThe lady was astonished, as she might well be, for she\nknew that he was not in earnest. They sat looking at one\nanother in silence. He had become very pale, and at last\nshe broke the silence by saying: \u201cThey have been faithful to\nthe government; they have been faithful to you; they will\nstill be loyal to the government, do what you will with\nthem. But, if you will grant my petition, you will be glad as\nlong as you live. The prayers of grateful hearts will give you\nstrength in the hour of trial, and strong and willing arms\nwill return to \ufb01ght your battles.\u201d\nThe President bowed his head; and, with a look of\nsadness which it is impossible for language to describe,\nsaid: \u201cI shall never be glad any more.\u201d All severity had\npassed away from his face, and he seemed looking inward\nand backward, and appeared unconscious of the fact that\n he was not alone. The great burdens he had borne, the\nterrible anxieties and perplexities that had poisoned his life\nat the fountain, and the peaceful scenes he had forever left\nbehind, swept across his memory; and then the thought\nthat it was possible that he had erred in judgment, and\ndone injustice to the noble men who had fought the nation\u2019s\nbattles, brought back all his child-like tenderness.\nThe lady heard his mournful utteranoes, and said: \u201cOh!\ndo not say so, Mr. Lincoln, for who will have so much\nreason to rejoice as yourself, when the government shall be\nrestored \u2014 as it will be?\u201d\n\u201cI know \u2014 I know,\u201d he said, pressing a hand on either\nside; \u201cbut the springs of life are wearing away, and I shall\nnot last.\u201d She asked him if he felt that his great cares were\ninjuring his health. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied; \u201cnot directly,\nperhaps.\u201d She asked him if he slept well. He never was a\ngood sleeper, he replied, and of course slept now less than\never before. Then, with earnestness, he said: \u201cThe people\ndo not yet comprehend the magnitude of the rebellion, and\nit will be a long time before the end.\u201d\nThe lady, feeling that she had occupied too much of his\ntime, rose to take her leave; and, as she did so, said: \u201cHave\nyou decided upon your answer to me?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he replied,\n\u201ccome to-morrow morning: \u2014 stop, it is cabinet-meeting to-\nmorrow. Yes, come at twelve o\u2019clock; there is not much for\nthe cabinet to do, to-morrow.\u201d Then he bade his visitor a\ncordial good morning, and she retired.\nThe next morning, the lady found that her interview had\nprostrated her; but at twelve o\u2019clock she was at the White\n House. The President sent her word that the cabinet would\nadjourn soon, and that she must wait. For three long hours\nshe waited, receiving occasional messages from Mr.\nLincoln, to the e\ufb00ect that the cabinet woUld soon adjourn,\nand he would then see her. She was in distress, expecting\ndefeat. She walked the room, and gazed at the maps; and,\nat last, she heard the sound of feet. The cabinet had\nadjourned. Mr. Lincoln did not send for her, but came\nshu\ufb04ing into the room, rubbing his hands, and saying: \u201cMy\ndear Madam, I am sorry I have kept you waiting so long,\nbut we have this moment adjourned.\u201d \u201cMy waiting is no\nmatter,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut you must be very tired, and we\nwill not talk to-night.\u201d Bidding her to a seat, she having\nrisen as he entered, he sat down at her side, and quietly\nremarked: \u201cI only wish to say to you that an order which is\nequivalent to the granting of a hospital in your state, has\nbeen issued from the War Department, nearly twenty-four\nhours.\u201d\nThe lady could make no reply, except through the tears\nthat sprang at once. Mr. Lincoln looked on, and enjoyed it.\nWhen, at last, she could command her voice, she said: \u201cGod\nbless you!\u201d Then, as doubts came, touching the nature of\nthe order, she said earnestly: \u201cDo you mean, really and\ntruly, that we are going to have a hospital now?\u201d With a\nlook full of benevolence and tenderness,-such a look as\nrarely illuminates any face, he said: \u201cI do most certainly\nhope so;\u201d and then he told her to come on the following\nmorning, and he would give her a copy of the order. But his\nvisitor was too much a\ufb00ected to talk; and perceiving this,\n he kindly changed the subject, asking her to look at a map\nwhich hung in the room, representing the great battle-\ngrounds of Europe. \u201cIt is a very \ufb01ne map,\u201d said he; \u201csee \u2014\nhere is Waterloo, here are all the battle-\ufb01elds about the\nCrimea.\u201d Then, suddenly turning to the lady, he said: \u201cI\u2019m\nafraid you will not like it so well, when I tell you who\nexecuted it.\u201d She replied: \u201cIt is a great work, whoever\nexecuted it. Who was it, Mr. President?\u201d \u201cMcClellan,\u201d he\nanswered, and added: \u201cHe certainly did do this well. He did\nit while he was at West Point.\u201d\nThe next morning, sick with the excitement through\nwhich she had passed, the lady was at the White House\nagain. She found more than \ufb01fty persons waiting for an\naudience; so she sent in her name, and said she would call\nagain. The messenger said he thought the President would\nsee her, and she had better be seated. Soon afterward, he\ninformed her that the President would see her. As she\npaeeed in, she heard the words from one of the waiting\nthrong: \u201cShe has been here six days; and, what is more, she\nis going to win.\u201d As she entered, Mr. Lincoln smiled\npleasantly, drew a chair to his side, and said: \u201cCome here,\nand sit down.\u201d As she did so, he handed her a copy of the\ncoveted order. She thanked him, and apologized for not\nbeing more promptly at the house; she had been sick all\nnight. \u201cDid joy make you sick?\u201d he inquired. \u201cI suppose,\u201d he\nadded, \u201cyou would have been mad if I had said \u2018no.\u2019\u201d She\nreplied: \u201cNo, Mr. Lincoln, I should have been neither angry\nnor sick.\u201d \u201cWhat would you have done?\u201d he inquired. \u201cI\nshould have been here at nine o\u2019clock this morning.\u201d\n \u201cWell,\u201d said he, laughing, \u201cI think I have acted wisely then.\u201d\nThen he turned suddenly, and looked into her face as he\nsaid: \u201cDon\u2019t you ever get angry?\u201d She replied that she\nnever did when she had an important object to attain.\nFurther conversation occurred as to the naming of the\nhospital, when the lady rose, and said: \u201cYou will not wish to\nsee me again.\u201d \u201cI did not say that, and I shall not say it,\u201d\nsaid the President. \u201cYou have been very kind to me, and I\nam very grateful for it,\u201d said his visitor. He looked up at her\nfrom under his eyebrows, in his peculiar way, and said:\n\u201cYou almost think I am handsome, don\u2019t you?\u201d His face was\nfull of benevolence, and his countenance lighted by a\ncordial smile; and it is not strange that the lady exclaimed:\n\u201cYou are perfectly lovely to me now, Mr. Lincoln.\u201d The\nPresident colored a little, and laughed a good deal, at the\nimpulsive response, and reached out his hand to bid her\nfarewell. She took it reverently, bowed her head upon it,\nand, bowing, prayed: \u201cGod bless you, Abraham Lincoln!\u201d\nThen she turned, heard his \u201cgood bye,\u201d and was gone.\n\u201cI shall never be glad any more!\u201d The young men of his\npeople were slain. His enemies were seeking his life. With a\nheart that beat kindly toward every human being, his\nmotives \nwere \nmaligned, \nand \nhis \ngood \nname \nwas\ncontemned; greedy politicians and ambitious o\ufb00icers were\nabout him, pushing forward their sel\ufb01sh schemes; he had\ndaily experience of the faithlessness of men; and \u201cthis great\ntrouble,\u201d as he was accustomed to call the war, was always\non his mind and heart. He could not sleep; and, such was\nthe character of the impression he had received from all his\n toils and cares, that he felt he could never be glad any\nmore.\nIn Mr. Lincoln\u2019s senatorial campaign, and during the\ncourse of his debates with Mr. Douglas, it will be\nremembered that he was not once betrayed into a loss of\ntemper. He was misrepresented and abused in every way, in\norder to break down his good nature; but, from the \ufb01rst to\nthe last, he did not utter an angry or an impatient word.\nThen he was well \u2014 in the full strength of a hardy\nconstitution. The interview just narrated has shown how\nmuch he had become changed by bearing the burdens of\no\ufb00ice. When he saw that his visitor was not only\noverthrowing his theory but the policy he had based upon\nit, and felt either that he was, or that he might be, in the\nwrong, he became peevish and querulous. This was very\nunlike Mr. Lincoln in health. He was one of the most\ngenerous of men in his dealings; but weakness and\nweariness made him on this, and on some other occasions,\nchildish and petulant. Exhibitions of this character, which\noccurred during the last two years of his life, are all\nreferable to the prostrated and irritable condition of his\nnervous system, resulting from excessive labor, mental\nsu\ufb00ering, and loss of sleep.\nThe interview with the lady will show, too, how universal\nand how minute were his cares. This case was only One\namong ten thousand cases that came to him for decision. It\nwas a great thing to her, and of itself made her sick. It luted\nwith her a week. It concerned the establishment of a\nhospital, simply. With him, the burden never was laid aside.\n He bore hundreds of matters upon his mind, all as\nimportant as this; and felt pressing upon his shoulders the\ninterests of freedom, the future of a wonderful nation, and\nthe destiny of a race; while he wielded as instruments for\nthe accomplishment of his purposes a great government,\nand an army composed of the \ufb02ower of the national life. It\nwas killing him. There was always one tired spot in him\nthat was not reached by rest.\nThroughout the rebellion, Mr. Lincoln was the recipient\nof many attentions from the various bodies which constitute\nthe Christian church of America. There was hardly a\ndenomination that did not take occasion to express itself\nupon the war, and the great questions of humanity which it\ninvolved. They visited Mr. Lincoln at the White House; they\napproached him with addresses and resolutions; and the\nmajority of them called forth from him either spoken or\nwritten responses. Representatives of foreign religious and\nphilanthropic organizations mingled their voices with\nthese. Expressions of personal sympathy, declarations of\nloyalty \nand \ndevotion \nto \nthe \nnational \ncause,\nrecommendations \nof \npolicy, \ncounsels, \nprayers,\nencouragements, \u2014 all poured in, in almost bewildering\nprofusion, \nand \nof \nthemselves \nbecame \na \nburden.\nMcPherson\u2019s History of the Rebellion gives forty-seven\nlarge and \ufb01nely printed pages, consisting entirely of\nrecords of the action of the northern churches upon the\nrebellion; and the results of this action were communicated\nto the President in a way to draw from him either grateful\n acknowledgments, or responses that related to their\nsubject matter.\nThe wear and tear of brain and nerve were often\nmanifested in a deep melancholy, to which he had a natural\ntendency. \u201cWhichever way it ends,\u201d said he to Mrs. Stowe,\nthe authoress, alluding to the war, \u201cI have the impression\nthat I shall not last long after it is over.\u201d Hon. Schuyler\nColfax met him one morning, after having received bad\nnews which had not been made public. He had neither slept\nnor breakfasted, and exclaimed: \u201cHow willingly would I\nexchange places to-day with the soldier who sleeps on the\nground in the army of the Potomac!\u201d During the doubts and\ndisasters of , a member of Congress called on him for\nconversation. Mr. Lincoln began to tell a tri\ufb02ing story. \u201cMr.\nPresident,\u201d said the Congressman, rising, \u201cI did not come\nhere this morning to hear stories. It is too serious a time.\u201d\nThe smile \ufb02ed from Mr. Lincoln\u2019s face, as he replied: \u201cA., sit\ndown. I respect you as an earnest and sincere man. You\ncannot be more anxious than I am constantly; and I say to\nyou now, that, if it were not for this occasional vent, I\nshould die.\u201d To aother he said: \u201cI feel a presentiment that I\nshall not outlast the rebellion. When it is over, my work will\nbe done.\u201d Of this presentiment he made no secret, but\nspoke of it to many of his friends.\nThus sad and weary, working early and late, full of the\nconsciousness that God was working through him for the\naccomplishment of great ends, praying daily for strength\nand guidance, with a heart full of warm charity toward his\nfoes, and open with sympathy toward the poor and the\n su\ufb00ering, this Christian President sat humbly in his high\nseat, and did his duty. It is with genuine pain that the\nwriter is compelled to leave behind, unrecorded, save in the\n\ufb02oating literature of the day, multiplied instances which\nillustrate his tender-heartedness, his pity, his over-ruling\nsense of justice, his patience under insult, his loveliness of\nspirit, his devotion to humanity, his regard for the poor and\nthe despised, his truthfulness, his simplicity, and the long\nlist of manly virtues which distinguished his character and\nhis career. They would of themselves \ufb01ll a volume.\nMr. Lincoln\u2019s character was one which will grow. It will\nbecome the basis of an ideal man. It was so pure, and so\nunsel\ufb01sh, and so rich in its materials, that \ufb01ne imaginations\nwill spring from it, to blossom and bear fruit through all the\ncenturies. This element was found in Washington, whose\nhuman weaknesses seem to have faded entirely from\nmemory, leaving him a demi-god; and it will be found in Mr.\nLincoln in a still more remarkable degree. The black race\nhave already crowned him. With the black man, and\nparticularly the black freed man, Mr. Lincoln\u2019s name is the\nsaintliest which he pronounces, and the noblest he can\nconceive. To the emancipated, he is more than man \u2014 a\nbeing scarcely second to the Lord Jesus Christ himself. That\nold, white-headed negro who undertook to tell what \u201cMassa\nLinkum\u201d was to his dark-minded brethren, imbodied the\nvague conceptions of his race, in the words: \u201cMassa\nLinkum, he ebery whar; he know ebery ting; he walk de\nearf like de Lord.\u201d He was to these men the incarnation of\npower and goodness; and his memory will live in the hearts\n of this unfortunate and oppressed race while it shall exist\nupon the earth.\n   ha ter   I .\nTHE EVENTS OF , legislative, military, and personal as\nthey relate to Mr. Lincoln, must receive only a brief and\ncondensed review. It will have been noticed, by several\nincidents that have been recorded in this narrative, and by\nsundry papers of Mr. Lincoln, that, during the whole of his\npresidency thus far, he had indulged in projects of\ncolonization of the freed blacks. Congress had so far\nregarded his suggestions as to place at his disposal a sum\nof money for experiments in colonization. In August, ,\nhe called to the Executive Mansion a representative\ncompany of negroes whom he familiarly addressed on the\nsubject, freely telling them of the disadvantages under\nwhich they labored, expressing his convictions that they\nsu\ufb00ered much by living in association with the whites, and\nuttering his conviction that the whites su\ufb00ered by living\nwith them, even when they were free. His wish was to have\nthem colonized at some point in Central America; and he\npromised to spend some of the money intrusted to him, if\nthey would join in su\ufb00icient numbers to make an\nexperiment.\nIn his message delivered to Congress on the opening of\nthe session of -, he called up the subject again; and\ncommunicated information of the measures he had taken,\nfor e\ufb00ecting his wishes, and securing to the blacks the\n bene\ufb01ts of the congressional provision. He had had\ncorrespondence \nwith \nsome \nof \nthe \nSpanish-American\nrepublics, and they had protested against the reception of\nblack colonies. He had declined to move any colonists\nforward, under the circumstances, and should still desist,\nunless they could be protected. Liberia and Hayti were the\nonly countries to which they could go, with the certainty of\nimmediate adoption as citizens; and the blacks manifested\na strange indisposition to emigrate to those countries.\nThis dream of colonization, in which Mr. Lincoln so\nbenevolently indulged, was destined to fail of even partial\nrealization. He loved the negro too well to wish him to\nremain where the prejudices of race would shut him out\nfrom the full recognition of his manhood. He not only\nwanted him free, but he wanted him located where he\nmight receive all the rights of citizenship, and where he\ncould live \u2014 self-respectful and independent \u2014 in the\nsociety of his equals and his race. It was a matter of pitying\nwonder with him that the negro should love to live with a\nrace that abused him, and held him at so low a value in the\nscale of humanity.\nAll the closing portion of this message was devoted to an\nearnest \ndiscussion \nof \nthe \nscheme \nof \ncompensated\nemancipation. \nNotwithstanding \nhe \nhad \nissued \nhis\npreliminary proclamation of freedom to the slaves of rebels,\nand \nexpected \nsoon \nto \ncomplete \nthat \nwork; \nand\nnotwithstanding his conviction that slavery could not long\nsurvive this proclamation, even in the loyal slave states, he\nnever forgot that neither over slavery in these states, the\n Constitution nor the necessities of war gave him any\ncontrol. One thing he did forget, viz: that these states had\nuniformly turned their backs upon all his earnest and kindly\ne\ufb00orts to save them from a loss which he was certain must\nultimately fall upon them.\nWith the exposition of his views upon this subject, Mr.\nLincoln submitted the draft of a resolution embodying his\npolicy. \nThis \nresolution \nproposed \ncertain \narticles \nas\namendments to the Constitution of the United States, to be\nacted upon by the legislatures or conventions of the several\nstates. These articles, by being adopted by the legislatures\nof three-fourths of the states, should become valid, and be\nheld as parts of the Constitution. They provided that every\nslave state which should voluntarily abolish the slave\nsystem at any date previous to the year , should\nreceive a speci\ufb01ed compensation. Slaves who should be\nfreed by the chances of war should remain free, though\nloyal masters should receive compensation for them. The\nclosing article provided that Congress might \u201cappropriate\nmoney, and otherwise provide for colonizing free colored\npersons, with their own consent, at any place or places\nwithout the United States.\u201d\nSudden emancipation was never in accordance with Mr.\nLincoln\u2019s judgment. Nothing but the necessities of war\nwould have induced him to decree it with relation to the\nslaves of any state. His thought was, that, by giving every\nstate the opportunity to terminate slavery in its own way,\nwithin a period of thirty-seven years, the institution could\nbe removed without a shock to the prosperity and the social\n institutions of the whites, and without bringing to the\nblacks a freedom which many of them, at least, would not\nknow how to use. The stress of feeling under which he\nurged this measure, is su\ufb00iciently exhibited by the closing\nparagraph of the message: \u201cFellow citizens,\u201d \u2014 thus reads\nthe passage\u2014 \u201cWe cannot escape history. We of this\nCongress, and this Administration, will be remembered in\nspite \nof \nourselves. \nNo \npersonal \nsigni\ufb01cance \nor\ninsigni\ufb01cance can spare one or another of us. The \ufb01ery trial\nthrough which we pass will light us down in honor or\ndishonor to the latest generation. We say that we are for\nthe Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We\nknow how to save the Union. The world knows we know\nhow to save it... In giving freedom to the slave, we assure\nfreedom to the free \u2014 honorable alike in what we give and\nwhat we preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the\nlast, best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this\ncould not, cannot, fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous,\njust \u2014 a way which, if followed, the world will forever\napplaud, and God must forever bless.\u201d\nAllusion has been made, in the preceding chapter, to the\naction of this session, on the subject of arbitrary arrests;\nand the subject does not need to be recalled further than to\nsay that the discussion which it excited fully illustrated the\npolitical antagonisms which, prevalent among the people,\nwere \nbrought \ninto \nthorough \nexposition \nby \ntheir\nrepresentatives. In the precise degree in which the\nmembers of both houses sympathized with treason, or were\nexcited by their party feelings against the general policy of\n the government toward the rebellion, did they oppose the\nsuspension of the write of habeas corpus. The same rule\ngood, with rare exceptions, with relation to the discussion\nof a project for arming the blacks. There were some friends\nof the government from the border states who were very\ntimid and doubtful about the adoption of this measure: but\nthe majority of the House agreed to it; and the Senate\nwould undoubtedly have done the same, had not the\ncommittee to which the matter was referred reported that\nthe President already had the power to call persons of\nAfrican descent into the military and naval service, by an\nact passed during the previous session.\nThe same antagonisms were exhibited concerning a\nmeasure for enrolling and drafting the militia of the\ndi\ufb00erent states, so that each state should be compelled to\ncontribute its equitable quota, the troops when raised to be\nunder the control of the President. The absolute necessity\nof this measure was attributable partly to the stage at\nwhich the war had arrived \u2014 when the surplus population\nwas all in the army, and it was essential to draw upon the\nvital resources of the country \u2014 and partly to party feeling\nand party policy. Either through the failure of McClellan\u2019s\ncampaign, or the e\ufb00ect of the emancipation proclamation,\nor the in\ufb02uence of both together, the administration had\nreceived a rebuke through the autumn elections of .\nThis had greatly encouraged the opposition, who, as\nopponents of the war, or as most unreliable friends of the\nPresident\u2019s war policy, so conducted their counsels that the\ngovernment became fearful concerning its ability to raise\n men for the campaign of . Just in proportion to the\ntreasonable sympathies of the members of the Senate and\nthe House, did they oppose the measure. The bill was\n\ufb01nally passed and approved; and it became an e\ufb00icient\ninstrument in the hands of the government for prosecuting\nthe war. It contained provisions for procuring substitutes,\nfor exemption by the payment of three hundred dollars, a\nclause de\ufb01ning the conditions of exemption, \nc.\nMuch of the session was devoted to a discussion of\nmeasures of \ufb01nance, which ended in giving the Secretary of\nthe Treasury leave to borrow nine hundred millions of\ndollars, bearing six per cent interest, payable in not less\nthan ten nor more than forty years. The Secretary was\nauthorized to issue four hundred millions in treasury notes\nbearing interest, and a hundred and \ufb01fty millions without\ninterest. To meet the immediate necessities of the army and\nnavy, especially as they related to debts due the soldiers\nand sailors, authority was given for the issue of one\nhundred millions of treasury notes, before the leading\nmeasures of \ufb01nance were perfected.\nThe latter measure was signed by the President at once,\nin order that the soldiers and marines might have their\ndue; but he took occasion, in a special message, to express\nhis regret that it had been found necessary to make so\nlarge an additional issue of United States notes, at a time\nwhen the combined circulation of those notes and the notes\nof the suspended banks had advanced the prices of\neverything beyond real values, augmenting the cost of\nliving, to the injury of labor, and the cost of supplies, to the\n injury of the country. \u201cIt seems very plain,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\ncontinued issues of United States notes, without any check\nto the issues of suspended banks, and without any\nadequate provision for the raising of money by loans, and\nfor funding the issues, so as to keep them within due limits,\nmust soon produce disastrous consequences.\u201d He had\nalready, in his annual message, advocated the national bank\nsystem for the production of a uniform currency, secured by\nthe pledge of United States bonds, thus increasing the\ndemand for the bonds. A bill for the object desired was\npassed by small majorities, and approved. It was a doubtful\nmeasure, and touched a great many sel\ufb01sh and corporate\ninterests, carrying more or less of disturbance into the\nvarious \ufb01nancial systems of the states; but the country has\nhad no reason to \ufb01nd fault with its results.\nTwo events during the session marked the beginning of\nthose \nreconstructive \nmeasures \nwhich \nwere \ndestined\neventually to embrace all the members of the old Union.\nWestern Virginia, loyal from the \ufb01rst, was admitted into the\nUnion as a state; and two representatives from Louisiana\nwere admitted to the House, under the representation, on\nthe part of the committee to which their application was\nreferred, that they had been elected in accordance with the\nconstitutional conditions and provisions of that state.\nWhen Congress adjourned, it left the Executive strong in\nall the powers and prerogatives necessary for the\nsuccessful prosecution of the war. The president\u2019s hands\nwere strengthened by competent \ufb01nancial provisions, by\nthe con\ufb01rmation of his power to arrest and hold suspicious\n and inimical persons, and by authority to levy upon the\nmilitia of the states for such force as might be necessary to\ne\ufb00ect the purposes of the government. His e\ufb00orts for\nmeasures of compensated emancipation failed. A single\nmeasure concerning Missouri miscarried through the\nfailure of the House to con\ufb01rm the action of the Senate.\nOn the twenty-second of November, , two months\nafter Mr. Lincoln issued his proclamation suspending the\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus, the opponents of the\ngovernment became so quiet that an order was issued from\nthe War Department, discharging from further military\nrestraint all those persons who had been arrested for\ndiscouraging volunteer enlistments, opposing the draft, or\notherwise giving aid and comfort to the enemy, in all states\nwhere the draft had been e\ufb00ected, or the quota of\nvolunteers and militia had been furnished. The order also\nreleased persons held in military custody who had been\narrested for disloyalty by the military governors of rebel\nstates, on giving their parole to do no act of hostility\nagainst the United States. They had the liberty to live\nunder military surveillance; or to go to the rebel states, not\nto return until after the war, or until they should be\npermitted to do so by the President. The suspension of the\nwrit, and the acts which accompanied it, accomplished\ntheir object temporarily; but, at the close of the session of\nCongress, in March, the more malicious of the malcontents\nbegan their foul work again. Undoubtedly the country was\ntired of the war; and many of the weaker and more\nunreasoning classes, \ufb01nding themselves more than ever in\n the hands of the government by the legislation of the\nwinter, lent willing ears to disloyal politicians. Agitation\nagainst the war was revived. The people were called upon\nto mark the great sacri\ufb01ces they had already uselessly\nmade; the war was declared to be a failure, and peace as\nfar o\ufb00 as ever; and the country was adjured to demand a\ncessation of the coercive policy.\nAmong the most pestilent of these sympathizers with\ntraitors, was Clement L. Vallandigham of Ohio \u2014 a person\nwho, as a member of Congress, stump politician and\nprivate citizen, had opposed the war from the start. In\nCongress, he had steadily voted against every measure\ninstituted by the government for maintaining the integrity\nof the nation and putting down the rebellion. Not a step did\nthe President take, in the execution of his purpose, that\nVallandigham did not dispute. Indeed, he o\ufb00ered in the\nHouse resolutions of censure for those early acts of the\nPresident in calling out a military force, by which alone\nWashington was saved from capture. His language in the\nHouse had been so bitter and disloyal that the feelings of\nevery friend of the government had been outraged. Going\nhome from Congress, where he had been engaged in his\nfoul work, he entered upon a canvass of his district,\ndenouncing the government, and maligning its motives.\nThe tendency of his malicious utterances was to weaken\nthe hands of the Executive in its great work of subduing the\ninsurrection, and to give aid and comfort to the national\nenemies.\n General Burnside, then in command of the Department\no  the Ohio, issued an order (Number ,) announcing that\nthereafter all persons found within the federal lines who\nshould commit acts for the bene\ufb01t of the enemy would be\ntried as spies or traitors; and, if convicted, would su\ufb00er\ndeath. This order, the demagogue publicly denounced; and\nthen he called upon the people to resist its execution.\nGeneral Burnside arrested him at once, and ordered him to\nbe tried by court-martial at Cincinnati. On the \ufb01fth of May,\nthe day following his arrest, he applied to the United States\nCircuit Court for a writ of habeas corpus; and after an\nelaborate argument from his counsel, and the reading of a\nlong letter from General Burnside giving the reasons for his\narrest, Judge Leavitt decided against his application, giving\nhis opinion that \u201cThe legality of the arrest depends upon\nthe extent of the necessity for making it; and that was to be\ndetermined by the military commander.\u201d Judge Leavitt\ndealt with the case nobly. \u201cThose who live under the\nprotection and enjoy the blessings of our benignant\ngovernment,\u201d said he, \u201cmust learn that they cannot stab its\nvitals with impunity. If they remain with us, while they are\nnot of us, they must be subject to such a course of dealing\nas the great law of self-preservation prescribes and will\nenforce.\u201d Further, he said: \u201cI confess I am but little moved\nby the eloquent appeals of those who, while they\nindignantly denounce violation of personal liberty, look with\nno horror upon a despotism as unmitigated as the world\nhas ever witnessed.\u201d\n On the following day, Vallandigham had his trial, was\nconvicted, and was sentenced to con\ufb01nement in some\nfortress of the United States, to be designated by General\nBurnside, who approved the \ufb01nding of the court, and\ndesignated Fort Warren as his prison. The President,\nhowever, modi\ufb01ed the sentence, and directed that the\nconvict should be sent within the rebel lines, among the\npeople which he held in such cordial sympathy, with the\ndirection that he should not return until after the\ntermination of the war. The man thus sent to his own found\nsafe conduct through the rebel states, and managed to\nreach Canada, from whose territory he subsequently\nemerged, without waiting for the termination of the war,\nand without saying to the President, \u201cBy your leave.\u201d\nThere were numbers of men in the loyal states who were\nquite as guilty as Mr. Vallandigham, even if less bold than\nhe. These took alarm. If Mr. Vallandigham could be arrested\nand sent within the rebel lines for abasing the motives acts\nof the government, who, that sympathized with Mr.\nVallandigham, was safe? It was a natural and pertinent\ninquiry. So they began to hold public meetings, to denounce\nthe government, and to call upon the President to\nreconsider his act in Vallandigham\u2019s case. Governor\nSeymour of New York was powerfully exercised in the\nmatter, and wrote a very spirited letter to one of these\nmeetings held in Albany, on the sixteenth of May. If the\nOhio demagogue used treasonable language, it is hard to\nsee why the New York governor did not. The sanction of the\nact by which Vallandigham was sent among his friends, by\n President and people, was, in his opinion, not only\ndespotism but revolution. He almost copied the language of\nthe convict himself. Mr. Vallandigham had said that the\ngovernment was aiming not to restore the Union, but to\ncrush out liberty. Governor Seymour said: \u201cThe action of\nthe administration will determine, in the minds of more\nthan one half of the people in the loyal states, whether this\nwar is waged to put down rebellion in the South, or destroy\nfree institutions at the North.\u201d\nThis meeting and others of the same kind, held in the\nleading cities of the Union, denounced arbitrary arrests and\nthe suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, protested\nagainst Vallandigham\u2019s sentence, and called upon the\nPresident to recall their injured friend and protege. A\nmonth after Vallandigham was banished, the Democratic\nState Convention of Ohio met, and, by almost a unanimous\nvote, nominated him as their candidate for governor, and\nSenator Pugh, his legal counsel, as their candidate for\nlieutenant governor. They also sent a committee to\nWashington to demand of the President the recall of their\ncandidate. The letter which they bore was answered at\nlength by the President; and he gave the supporters of Mr.\nVallandigham a very plain talk. He told them what he\nbelieved to be the facts touching Mr. Vallandigham\u2019s words\nand in\ufb02uence, in opposition to those means which the\ngovernment deemed indispensable to its own preservation,\nand then said: \u201cYour own attitude, therefore, encourages\ndesertion, resistance to the draft, and the like, because it\nteaches those who incline to desert and to escape the draft,\n to believe it is your purpose to protect them.\u201d He told them,\nhowever, that the proceedings in Mr. Vallandigham\u2019s case\nwere \u201cfor prevention, not for punishment \u2014 an injunction to\nstay an injury;\u201d \u2014 and that the modi\ufb01cation of General\nBurnside\u2019s order was made as a less disagreeable mode to\nMr. \nVallandigham \nhimself \nof \nsecuring \nthe \ndesired\nprevention.\nIt is hardly to be doubted that Mr. Lincoln would never,\nof his own motion, have arrested the greatly over-rated\nsubject of these discussions. He had talked as badly in\nWashington as he had in Ohio, and lost no opportunity to\nabuse the President himself; but Mr. Lincoln very severely\nlet him alone. When, therefore, he clandestinely returned, a\nyear afterwards, and fulminated his threats against the\ngovernment, in case he should be arrested in any way\nexcept by o\ufb00icers of the civil tribunals, he was permitted to\nsay what he pleased. The people of Ohio had already\ndecided against him by a majority of one hundred thousand\nvotes; and he had lost his power for harm, except where he\nmight choose to bestow his friendship.\nTo the resolutions passed by the Albany meeting of which\nHon. Erastus Corning was president, Mr. Lincoln made an\nelaborate reply. This was his favorite \ufb01eld. He had got hold\nof a case to argue; and its importance, in his apprehension,\nmay be judged by the fact that he spent more time and\nexhausted more pains upon this paper than upon any other\nwritten during his administration, messages included. It\nwas intended to be the full and exhaustive vindication of his\npolicy, upon the subjects it covered, before the American\n people; and the American people so regarded it. No\nheadway could be made against it, and no serious and\ncandid attempt was made to answer it.\nThese pages will not give space to the entire document,\nor even a review of the argument; but some of its\nillustrations may be cited as giving its drift and style. In\narguing the necessity of the arrest of those who were\nknown to be traitors, but who had committed no overt act\nof treason, he said: \u201cGeneral John C. Breckinridge, General\nRobert E. Lee, General Joseph E. Johnston, General John B.\nMagruder, General William B. Preston, General Simon B.\nBuckner, \nand \nCommodore \nFranklin \nBuchanan, \nnow\noccupying the very highest places in the rebel war service,\nwere all within the power of the government since the war\nbegan, and were nearly as well known to be traitors then as\nnow. Unquestionably, if we had seized and held them, the\ninsurgent cause would be much weaker. But no one of them\nhad committed any crime de\ufb01ned in the law. Every one of\nthem, if arrested, would have been discharged on habeas\ncorpus, were the writ allowed to operate. In view of these\nand similar cases, I think the time not unlikely to come\nwhen I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests,\nrather than too many.\u201d\nCertainly here was a case in point; and it is hard to see\nwhy reasoning that applies so well to those men would not\napply as well to those still in the power of the government,\nwho had notoriously so opposed the war as to hinder that\ngovernment from conquering the traitors named. Mr.\nVallandigham \u201cwas not arrested,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause he was\n damaging the political prospects of the administration, or\nthe personal interests of the commanding general; but\nbecause he was damaging the army, upon the existence and\nvigor of which the life of the nation depends.\u201d Furthermore:\n\u201cMust I shoot a simple-minded soldier-boy, who deserts,\nwhile I must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces\nhim to desert? I think that, in such a case, to silence the\nagitator and save the boy, is not only constitutional, but\nwithal a great mercy.\u201d\nThe Albany meeting had spoken to Mr. Lincoln as\n\u201cdemocrats.\u201d To this aspect of the matter he paid his\naddresses. He would have preferred to meet them on the\nhigher platform of \u201cAmerican citizens,\u201d at such a time; but,\nsince he was denied this privilege, he comforted himself\nwith the re\ufb02ection that all democrats did not believe with\nthem. General Burnside, who arrested Mr. Vallandigham,\nwas a democrat. Judge Leavitt, who refused to release him\non the writ of habeas corpus, was also a democrat who\nreceived his mantle from the hand of Jackson himself; and\nspeaking of Jackson reminded him of an incident in point:\n\u201cAfter the battle of New Orleans, and while the fact that the\ntreaty of peace had been concluded was well known in the\ncity, but before o\ufb00icial knowledge of it had arrived, General\nJackson still maintained martial or military law. Now that it\ncould be said the war was over, the clamor against martial\nlaw, which had existed from the \ufb01rst, grew more furious.\nAmong \nother \nthings, \na \nMr. \nLouiallier \npublished \na\ndenunciatory newspaper article. General Jackson arrested\nhim. A lawyer by the name of Morel procured the United\n States Judge Hall to issue a writ of habeas corpus to relieve\nMr. Louiallier. General Jackson arrested both the lawyer\nand the Judge. A Mr. Hollander ventured to say of some\npart of the matter that it was a \u2018dirty trick.\u2019 General\nJackson arrested him. When the o\ufb00icer undertook to serve\nthe writ of habeas corpus, General Jackson took it from\nhim, and sent him away with a copy. Holding the Judge in\ncustody a few days, the General sent him beyond the limits\nof his encampment, and set him at liberty, with an order to\nremain until the rati\ufb01cation of peace should be regularly\nannounced, or until the British should have left the\nsouthern coast. A day or two more elapsed, the rati\ufb01cation\nof a treaty of peace was regularly announced, and the\nJudge and others were fully liberated. A few days more, and\nthe Judge called General Jackson into court, and \ufb01ned him\none thousand dollars for having arrested him and the\nothers named. The General paid the \ufb01ne, and there the\nmatter rested for nearly thirty years, when Congress\nrefunded principal and interest.\u201d\nMr. Lincoln could not avoid adding that Senator Douglas,\nthen a member of the House, was a prominent advocate of\nthis democratic measure; and remarking: \u201cFirst, that we\nhad the same constitution then as now; second, that we\nthen had a case of invasion, and now we have a case of\nrebellion; and, third, that the permanent right of the people\nto public discussion, the liberty of speech and of the press,\nthe trial by jury, the law of evidence, and the habeas\ncorpus, su\ufb00ered no detriment whatever by that conduct of\n General Jackson, or its subsequent approval by the\nAmerican Congress.\u201d\nTo obviate an objection made to the course of the\nadministration, in permitting the privilege of the writ of\nhabeas corpus to be suspended at the pleasure of the heads\nof military departments, thus delegating the authority, Mr.\nLincoln, by proclamation on the \ufb01fteenth day of September,\nsuspended the writ throughout the United States.\nUnder the enrollment act, passed March third, a draft of\nmilitia was ordered for July, and was e\ufb00ected without\nserious disturbance, except in a single instance, in the city\nof New York. Great e\ufb00orts had been made by interested\npoliticians, during the spring and summer, to make certain\nprovisions of the act odious to the people, especially to the\nlower and more unreasoning classes. The clause exempting\nfrom conscription on the payment of three hundred dollars,\nwas represented to be intended for the bene\ufb01t of the rich;\nand the bad passions of the mob were wrought upon in\nvarious ways. The \ufb01rst day of the draft in New York, July\neleventh, though attended with some excitement, witnessed\nno outbreak or violent opposition: but the Sunday that\nintervened between that day and the resumption of the\ndraft on the thirteenth, a\ufb00orded an opportunity for\norganization: and, when the fateful wheels started again,\none of them was seized by a mob, and destroyed; and the\nbuilding which contained it was \ufb01red. For four days\nthereafter, New York was under the reign of riot. The\ntroops were all away, having been called upon to resist the\ninvasion of Maryland and Pennsylvania. During this fearful\n period, the most \ufb01endish outrages were visited upon the\nharmless black population of the city, houses belonging to\nprominent supporters of the government were sacked and\nburned, and plunder became the one ruling passion of all\nthe worst inhabitants of the city. Those who had led on the\nmob, as a demonstration against the draft, soon found that\nthey could not direct the whirlwind, and that the passions\nthey had aroused were altogether beyond their control.\nWomen and children of the lowest classes gave free rein to\ntheir thievish impulses; and, after a single day of riot, the\ndraft was forgotten in the greed for spoil. The disgraceful\nproceedings were not stayed until the return of the\nregiments that had been sent away.\nThe Governor of New York, friendly neither to the\nadministration nor to the draft, asked for a postponement\nof the measure of conscription until volunteering could be\ntried; and he complained of certain inequalities of the\ngovernment requisitions in certain districts of the state. Mr.\nLincoln replied, temporarily yielding the point in relation to\nfour districts, and promising a careful re-enrollment, but\nsaying that the draft must be proceeded with. The\nGovernor wished for delay, also, in order that the\nconstitutionality of the draft law might be tried. Mr. Lincoln\nreplied that he should be willing to facilitate the bringing of\nthe law before the Supreme Court, but he could not\nconsent to lose the time. \u201cWe are contending,\u201d said he,\n\u201cwith an enemy who, as I understand, drives every able-\nbodied man he can reach into his ranks, very much as a\nbutcher drives bullocks into a slaughter-pen. No time is\n wasted, no argument is used. This produces an army which\nwill soon turn upon our now victorious soldiers, already in\nthe \ufb01eld, if they shall not be sustained by recruits as they\nshould be. It produces an army with a rapidity not to be\nmatched on our side, if we \ufb01rst waste time to re-experiment\nwith the volunteer system, already deemed by Congress,\nand palpably, in fact, so far exhausted as to be inadequate;\nand then more time to obtain a court decision as to whether\na law is constitutional which requires a part of those not\nnow in the service to go to the aid of those already in it;\nand still more time to determine with absolute certainty\nthat we get those who are to go in the precisely legal\nproportion to those who are not to go.\u201d The Governor was\nstill in trouble about the inequality of the quotas in the\ndistricts, and regretted that the President would not\nsuspend the draft. The President understood his duty, and\ndid not misunderstand Governor Seymour; and the draft\nwas \nresumed \nand \npeacefully \nconsummated, \nthrough\nmeasures of protection instituted by the war department.\nThe popularity of Mr. Lincoln and his administration had\nentirely recovered from whatever depressing in\ufb02uence the\nemancipation policy had occasioned, and from the e\ufb00ects of\nthe Peninsular campaign. His determined pursuit of duty,\nwhatever the consequences might be to himself, won him\nfriends among his enemies. The spring elections of \nshowed a reaction from those of the previous autumn, and\nthe fall elections con\ufb01rmed his growing popularity. The\nelections in New York were a direct and decided\nindorsement of the draft in that state, and, in the same\n degree, a condemnation of those who had opposed it. Ohio\ndecided Mr. Vallandigham\u2019s case by giving a tremendous\nmajority on the side of the government. Pennsylvania re-\nelected Governor Curtin by an unexpected majority; and\nthe same successes occurred in every state, with the single\nexception of New Jersey. To Mr. Lincoln, who watched the\nindications of the public feeling and opinion with constant\nanxiety, \nthese \nevents \nbrought \ngreat \nrelief \nand\nencouragement. \nThe \nSouth \nhad \nbeen \nwatching \nfor\noutbreaks, and its northern friends had been prophesying\nthem. The South had been expecting the growth of a peace\nparty, and its northern friends had endeavored to bring one\ninto the \ufb01eld; but the fall elections of  crushed the\nrebel expectations; and the whole North was regarded by\nthe traitors as bound to the fortunes of that horrible tyrant\n\u2014 that blood-thirsty boor \u2014 Abraham Lincoln. In the\nmeantime, Mr. Lincoln had made great progress in the\nesteem of foreign governments and foreign peoples, of\nwhich he received abundant testimonials.\nEarly in the year, the working men of Manchester,\nEngland, sent him a letter, to which he gave a grateful and\ncordial \nreply. \nThey, \nalthough \ngreatly \nsu\ufb00ering \nin\nconsequence of the war, sent him their sympathy; and in his\nreply, he said to them: \u201cIt has been often and studiously\nrepresented \nthat \nthe \nattempt \nto \noverthrow \nthis\ngovernment, which was built upon the foundation of human\nrights, and to substitute for it one which should rest\nexclusively upon the basis of human slavery, was likely to\nobtain the favor of Europe. Through the action of our\n disloyal citizens, the working men of Europe have been\nsubjected to severe trial, for the purpose of forcing their\nsanction to that attempt. Under these circumstances, I\ncannot but regard your decisive utterances upon the\nquestion as an instance of sublime Christian heroism,\nwhich has not been surpassed in any age, or in any\ncountry... I do not doubt that the sentiments you have\nexpressed will be sustained by your great nation; and, on\nthe other hand, I have no hesitation in assuring you that\nthey will excite admiration, esteem, and the most reciprocal\nfeelings of friendship among the American people.\u201d\nIn a letter written August twenty-sixth, to James C.\nConkling, in reply to an invitation to attend a mass meeting\nof \u201cunconditional Union men,\u201d to be held at his old home in\nSpring\ufb01eld, Illinois, it is evident that Mr. Lincoln was\nhopeful and con\ufb01dent of results. In this letter he treated\nagain of the subject of emancipation; and handled the\nclamorer for peace, the enemies of the Emancipation\nProclamation, and the advocates of compromise, with most\nadmirable skill. The closing paragraphs are peculiarly keen,\nclear and sparkling:\n\u201cYou say that you will not \ufb01ght to free negroes. Some of\nthem seem willing to \ufb01ght for you; but no matter. Fight you,\nthen, exclusively to save the Union. I issued the\nProclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the Union.\nWhenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the\nUnion, if I shall urge you to continue \ufb01ghting, it will be an\napt time then for you to declare you win not \ufb01ght to free\nnegroes. I thought that, in your struggle for the Union, to\n whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the\nenemy, to that extent it weakened the enemy in his\nresistance to you. Do you think di\ufb00erently? I thought that\nwhatever negroes can be got to do as soldiers, leaves just\nso much less for white soldiers to do in saving the Union.\nDoes it appear otherwise to you? But negroes, like other\npeople, act upon motives. Why should they do anything for\nus, if we will do nothing for them? If they stake their lives\nfor us, they must be prompted by the strongest motive,\neven the promise of freedom. And the promise, being made,\nmust be kept.\n\u201cThe signs look better. The Father of Waters again goes\nunvexed to the sea. Thanks to the great Northwest for it;\nnor yet wholly to them. Three hundred miles up they met\nNew England, Empire, Keystone, and Jersey, hewing their\nway right and left. The sunny South, too, in more colors\nthan one, also lent a helping hand. On the spot, their part\nof the history was jotted down in black and white. The job\nwas a great national one; and let none be slighted who bore\nan honorable part in it. And while those who have cleared\nthe great river may well be proud, even that is not all. It is\nhard to say that anything has been more bravely and well\ndone than at Antietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on\nmany \ufb01elds of less note. Nor must Uncle Sam\u2019s webfeet be\nforgotten. At all the watery margins they have been\npresent, not only on the deep sea, the broad bay, and the\nrapid river, but also up the narrow, muddy bayou, and\nwherever the ground was a little damp they have been and\nmade their tracks. Thanks to all. For the great Republic \u2014\n for the principle it lives by and keeps alive \u2014 for man\u2019s vast\nfuture \u2014 thanks to all.\n\u201cPeace does not appear so distant as it did. I hope it will\ncome soon, and come to stay; and so come as to be worth\nthe keeping in all future time. It will then have been proved\nthat among freemen there can be no successful appeal from\nthe ballot to the bullet, and that they who take such appeal\nare sure to lose their case and pay the cost. And there will\nbe some black men who can remember that with silent\ntongue, and clinched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised\nbayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great\nconsummation; while I fear there will be some white ones\nunable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful\nspeech they have striven to hinder it.\u201d\nThe military events of the year were of great importance,\nand, on the whole, well calculated to give hope, not only to\nMr. Lincoln, but to the loyal people of the whole country.\nAfter the battle of Fredericksburg, in December, , the\narmy of the Potomac did nothing for several months. Late\nin April \u2014 General Burnside having meantime been\nrelieved, and General Hooker placed in command \u2014 a\nmovement was made across the river, and the battle of\nChancellorsville was fought, which resulted in the retreat\nof our army, and a loss of eighteen thousand men. It was a\nsad beginning of the year\u2019s operations, and was followed by\nthe invasion of Maryland and Pennsylvania by the whole of\nGeneral Lee\u2019s forces. The invasion took place in June; and it\nwas accomplished so quickly, so easily, and by so great a\nforce, that the whole country became terribly excited. The\n President issued a proclamation calling for one hundred\nthousand militia to assist in driving back the foe. The army\nunder Hooker crossed the Potomac at about the same time\nwith the army of Lee, and both entered Maryland together.\nHere General Hooker was relieved, and General Meade\nplaced in command, who, \ufb01nding the enemy advancing\ntoward and into Pennsylvania, pushed forward with his\narmy to dispute the movement. On the \ufb01rst of July, the\nbattle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania began; and it raged\nwith terri\ufb01c energy for three days. It was one of the most\nbrilliant and terrible battles of the war. On the \ufb01fth of July,\nthe enemy, who had been terribly punished, and saw that\nhis invasion was a failure, retreated, and was pursued by\nour weary forces back to the old position on the\nRappahannock. At the close of the \ufb01ghting on the third, it\nwas evident that the enemy was whipped; and the\nPresident announced the fact on the fourth, by a dispatch\nsent over the whole country, stating that the news was such\nas to cover the army with the highest honor, and to promise\na great success to the cause of the Union. With\ncharacteristic reverence, he closed by expressing his desire\nthat on that day \u2014 the anniversary of the national\nindependence\u2014 \u201cHe whose will, not ours, should ever be\ndone, be everywhere remembered, and reverenced with\nprofoundest gratitude.\u201d Our losses in this battle, in killed,\nwounded and missing, amounted to twenty-three thousand\nmen, while those of the enemy were much greater, leaving,\nindeed, fourteen thousand prisoners in our hands. The state\nof Pennsylvania, with considerate liberality, subsequently\n purchased a piece of land adjoining the cemetery of the\ntown, where much severe \ufb01ghting took place, as a burial\nground for the loyal dead of the great battle. This place was\ndedicated on the succeeding nineteenth of November, in\nthe presence of Mr. Lincoln and his cabinet, Hon. Edward\nEverett delivering the formal address of the occasion. The\nbrief remarks of Mr. Lincoln. though brought into\nimmediate comparison with the elaborate eloquence of the\nvenerable Massachusetts orator, were very e\ufb00ective, and\nbetrayed a degree of literary ability quite unexpected to\nthose who had read only his formal state papers. He said:\n\u201cFourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought\nforth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty,\nand dedicated to the proposition that all men are created\nequal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing\nwhether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so\ndedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-\n\ufb01eld of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that\n\ufb01eld as a \ufb01nal resting-place for those who here gave their\nlives that that nation might live. It is altogether \ufb01tting and\nproper that we should do this. But in a larger sense we\ncannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow\nthis ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled\nhere, have consecrated it far above our power to add or\ndetract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what\nwe say here; but it can never forget what they did here. It\nis for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the\nun\ufb01nished work which they who fought here have thus far\nso nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated\n to the great task remaining before us, that from these\nhonored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for\nwhich they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we\nhere highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in\nvain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of\nfreedom, and that the government of the people, by the\npeople, and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\u201d\nDid Mr. Everett say more or better in all his pages than\nMr. Lincoln said in these lines? Yet they were written after\nhe left Washington, and during a brief interval of leisure.\nThe Fourth of July was further rendered memorable by\nthe surrender of the city of Vicksburg \u2014 the stronghold of\nthe Mississippi River \u2014 by General Pemberton to General\nGrant, with all his defenses and his army of thirty thousand\nmen. After various unsuccessful operations, beginning with\nthe year, contemplating the capture of this city, General\nGrant ran by the batteries with his transports, and landed\nfar down the river, to attempt the approach of the city from\nthe rear. Fighting all the way, and winning every battle, he\nreached Jackson, and then advanced westward, directly\nupon the doomed town. General Pemberton, in the\nendeavor to dispute his progress, lost at Baker\u2019s Creek four\nthousand men and twenty-nine pieces of artillery. On the\nbanks of the Big Black, the enemy gave battle again, and\nwas again defeated, with a loss of nearly three thousand\nmen, and seventeen pieces of artillery. Then Pemberton fell\nback behind his defenses, which he did not leave till, on the\nnational anniversary, he and his army marched forth as\nprisoners of war, leaving behind them more than two\n hundred cannon, and seventy thousand stand of small-\narms. Four days later, Port Hudson, which had been closely\nbesieged by an army advancing from the south, under\nGeneral Banks, surrendered with seven thousand prisoners\nand \ufb01fty cannon.\nThus was the confederacy cut in twain; and from that\nhour its cause was doomed. Not a life was lost afterwards\nthat was not lost in the destruction and defense of a\nhopeless cause. \u201cThe Father of Waters,\u201d wrote Mr. Lincoln,\nin glad and poetic mood, to Mr. Conkling, \u201cagain goes\nunvexed to the sea.\u201d It was a great event, and one which\nmight well \ufb01ll the heart of the President with exultation.\nThese victories gave great encouragement to the loyal\npeople of the country; and, from the day of their\noccurrence, there was but little doubt among them of the\n\ufb01nal triumph of the national cause. In Washington, there\nwere great rejoicings; and of course there was a popular\ncall upon Mr. Lincoln, who, in response to a serenade, came\nout, and made a brief speech. These calls were not\noccasions in which he delighted, and it was honest and\ncharacteristic for him to say, in beginning: \u201cI am very glad\nindeed to see you to-night, and yet I will not say I thank you\nfor this call; but I do most sincerely thank Almighty God for\nthe occasion on which you have called.\u201d\nAnother very characteristic utterance of Mr. Lincoln, in\nconnection with these events, was a letter written to\nGeneral Grant, July thirteenth, in which he took occasion to\nacknowledge that results had con\ufb01rmed the General\u2019s\njudgment rather than his own:\n \u201cMy Dear General: I do not remember that you and I ever\nmet \npersonally. \nI \nwrite \nthis \nnow \nas \na \ngrateful\nacknowledgment for the almost inestimable service you\nhave done the country. I write to say a word further. When\nyou \ufb01rst reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you\nshould do what you \ufb01nally did \u2014 march the troops across\nthe neck, run the batteries with the transports, and thus go\nbelow; and I never had any faith, except a general hope\nthat you knew better than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition\nand the like could succeed. When you got below, and took\nPort Gibson, Grand Gulf, and vicinity, I thought you should\ngo down the river and join General Banks; and when you\nturned northward, east of the Big Black, I feared it was a\nmistake. I wish now to make the personal acknowledgment\nthat you were right and I was wrong.\u201d\nThe President\u2019s praise of General Grant was the voice of\nthe country. The capture of Vicksburg, with its preliminary\nbattles, was the work of a great general, and one of the\nmost brilliant feats in the history of war. The country felt\nthat it had one man, at least, who was not only thoroughly\nin earnest, but who was the master of his profession.\nThe operations in the west were pursued with various\nfortunes during the year; but with \ufb01nal results wholly in\nour favor. On the \ufb01fth of January, a battle occurred at\nMurfreesboro, which ended in the federal occupation of the\nplace, and the falling back of the enemy to Tullahoma,\nwhere he entrenched himself. On the twenty-\ufb01fth of June,\nGeneral Rosecrans advanced, and made an attack, driving\nBragg and his army back in confusion. Pursuit was made as\n far as practicable, and Bragg kept up his retreat until he\nreached Chattanooga. Rosecrans came up with him August\ntwenty-\ufb01rst, and then Bragg retired again, but, after\nreceiving reinforcements, turned, and, on September\nnineteenth, \nmade \nan \nattack \nupon \nour \narmy. \nThe\nengagement was a desperate one, in\ufb02icting severe losses\nupon the federal forces; but the rebels gained no\npermanent advantages. Burnside at Knoxville had been\nordered to join Rosecrans, but had failed to do so, and,\nafter the battle, Longstreet\u2019s corps of the rebel army was\nsent against him, while the enemy held his main force at or\nnear Chattanooga. On the twenty-\ufb01fth of November,\nGeneral Grant, who, having \ufb01nished up his Vicksburg job,\nhad assumed command, attacked Bragg, and utterly routed\nhim, crowding him back into Georgia. Then Grant paid his\nrespects to Longstreet, who was besieging Knoxville, and\nthat General made safe his retreat into Virginia.\nMr. Lincoln, who had prayed for all these successes,\nreferred them directly and at once to the favor of God. His\nannouncement of the federal success at Gettysburg was\naccompanied by a call upon the people to remember and\nreverence Him with profoundest gratitude. After the fall of\nVicksburg, he publicly thanked Almighty God for the event.\nOn the \ufb01fteenth of July, he issued a proclamation, setting\napart the sixth day of August to be observed as a day for\nnational thanksgiving, praise and prayer: inviting the\npeople to \u201crender the homage due to the Divine Majesty,\nfor the wonderful things he has done in the nation\u2019s behalf:\nand invoke the in\ufb02uences of his Holy Spirit to subdue the\n anger which has produced and so long sustained a needless\nand cruel rebellion; to change the hearts of the insurgents;\nto guide the counsels of the government with wisdom\nadequate to so great a national emergency; and to visit\nwith tender care and consolation, throughout the length\nand breadth of our land, all those who, through the\nvicissitudes of marches, voyages, battles and sieges, have\nbeen brought to su\ufb00er in mind, body, or estate; and, \ufb01nally,\nto lead the whole nation through paths of repentance and\nsubmission to the Divine Will, back to the perfect\nenjoyment of union and fraternal peace.\u201d On the third of\nOctober he issued another proclamation of thanksgiving,\nsetting apart the last Thursday of November as the day to\nbe observed. The spirit of tender piety which this document\nbreathed in every part, could only have come from a heart\nsurcharged with that spirit. Still again, having heard of the\nretreat of the insurgent forces from East Tennessee, he\nissued \na \ndispatch \non \nthe \nseventh \nof \nDecember,\nrecommending all loyal people, on the receipt of the\ninformation. to assemble at their places of worship, \u201cand\nrender special homage and gratitude to Almighty God for\nthis great advancement of the national cause.\u201d\nOne of the most vexatious events of the year, to Mr.\nLincoln, was the quarrel among his friends in Missouri,\ndating as far back as the removal of General Fremont, and\nnot frowned upon by that General at its inception. An order\nof General Halleck, who succeeded General Hunter in\nMissouri, excluding fugitive slaves from his lines, though\nissued only for military reasons, helped on the discord.\n Then \ncame \ndiscussions \nand \naction \nconcerning\nemancipation, the parties dividing on the issue of gradual\nor immediate emancipation; and this was followed, or\naccompanied, by disagreement between the commander of\nthe federal forces and Governor Gamble, controlling the\nstate \ntroops, \nraised \noriginally \nas \nauxiliary \nto \nthe\ngovernment. General Curtis, who was in command of the\ndepartment, was removed because he and Governor\nGamble could not agree, and not because he had done any\nwrong; and General Scho\ufb01eld was put in his place. This\no\ufb00ended \nGovernor \nGamble\u2019s \nenemies, \nand \nthey\nremonstrated. Mr. Lincoln, in a note written at this time,\nsaid: \u201cIt is very painful to me that you, in Missouri, cannot\nor will not settle your factional quarrel among yourselves. I\nhave been tormented with it beyond endurance for a\nmonth, by both sides. Neither side pays the least respect to\nmy appeals to your reason.\u201d\nGeneral Fremont\u2019s friends wanted him recalled, and\ndesired him to be military governor, setting Governor\nGamble aside. Deputations, committees, and independent\npartisans visited Washington to \u201ctorment\u201d the President\nstill more. Each carried back a report, and made the most\nof it, to feed the quarrel. During the summer of , the\npublic \nfeeling \ncame \nup \nto \nfever \nheat. \nGradual\nemancipationists were denounced as traitors by the radical\nemancipation party, which claimed to represent the only\nloyal elements of the state; and, of course, gradual\nemancipationists retorted the charge, and assumed the\nclaim. On the \ufb01fth of October, the President wrote a long\n letter, reviewing the whole case, in his own frank and lucid\nway. He also sent a letter of instruction to General\nScho\ufb01eld, in which he directed him so to use his power as\n\u201cto compel the excited people there to let one another\nalone.\u201d Neither the letter nor the instructions produced the\nslightest e\ufb00ect in quieting the political agitation, or\nsoftening the personal feeling which accompanied it. The\ndepartment was subsequently placed under the command\nof General Rosecrans; and the quarrel itself died out, or\nceased to attract public and presidential attention. In the\nPresident\u2019s letter to General Scho\ufb01eld, at the time of his\nappointment, he said to him: \u201cIf both factions or neither\nabuse you, you will probably be about right. Beware of\nbeing assailed by one and praised by the other.\u201d Judged by\nhis own rule in this case, the President was as nearly right\nas he could be, for both sides abused him thoroughly. Let it\nbe said, however, to their credit, that, at the succeeding\npresidential election, both supported him, and contributed\nto his triumph.\n   ha ter    I.\nON THE TH of December, , Mr. Lincoln sent in his\nannual message to Congress, which had assembled on the\nseventh. It represented the country as holding satisfactory\nrelations with foreign powers; spoke favorably of the\nestablishment of an international telegraph across the\nAtlantic; referred to the movements abroad for emigration\nto this country, to \ufb01ll the demand for labor in every \ufb01eld of\nindustry; stated that the operations of the Treasury\nDepartment had been successfully conducted during the\nyear; and gave a general historical account of the\noperations of the army and navy. Eleven months had passed\nsince the \ufb01nal proclamation of emancipation was issued;\nand Mr. Lincoln took up the matter to see what progress\nhad been made under its operations. The policy of\nemancipation and of the employment of black soldiers had\nchanged the aspect of a\ufb00airs; and, though it was\nimmediately followed by dark and doubtful days, the results\nhad vindicated its wisdom. The rebel borders had been\npressed still further back; the rebel territory had been\ndivided by the opening of the Mississippi; Tennessee and\nArkansas had been substantially cleared of insurgent\ncontrol; and, in these states, in\ufb02uential citizens were\ndeclaring openly for emancipation. Maryland and Missouri,\nneither of which states, three years previously, would\n tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into\nnew territories, were disputing only as to the best mode of\nremoving it from their own limits. Of those who were slaves\nat the beginning of the rebellion, full one hundred thousand\nwere in the military service of the United States, and about\none-half of them were bearing arms in the ranks. No servile\ninsurrection, or tendency to violence or cruelty, had marked\nthe measures of emancipation and the arming of the blacks.\nThe tone of public feeling abroad had improved under the\nin\ufb02uence of the policy, while the government had been\nencouraged and supported by elections at home. The new\nreckoning showed that the crisis which threatened to divide\nthe friends of the Union was passed.\nThe message treated with considerable detail a question\nwhich had, from the \ufb01rst, been one of great importance,\nand which, it was seen, would grow more important with\nthe progress of events. On the day previous to the delivery\nof the message, he had issued a proclamation of amnesty,\nto all those engaged in the rebellion who should take an\noath to support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the\nUnited States, and the Union of the states under it, with the\nacts of Congress passed during the rebellion, and the\nproclamations of the President concerning slaves. This\nproclamation made certain exceptions of persons in the\ncivil and military service of the rebel government, and of\npersons who had left the civil and military service of the\nUnited States to aid in the rebellion. It further declared\nthat whenever, in any of the rebel states, a number of\npersons, not less than one-tenth of the quali\ufb01ed voters,\n should take this oath, and establish a state government\nwhich should be republican, it should be recognized as the\ntrue government of the state. These were the principal\nprovisions of the proclamation; and to them the President\ncalled congressional attention.\nHe had issued it, he said, \u201clooking to the present and the\nfuture, and with reference to a resumption of the national\nauthority in the states wherein that authority had been\nsuspended.\u201d He had given the form of an oath; but no man\nwas coerced to take it. Men were only promised pardon in\ncase they should voluntarily take it. Amnesty was o\ufb00ered,\nso that, if, in any of the rebel states, a state government\nshould be set up, in the mode prescribed, it should be\nrecognized and guaranteed by the United States, and\nprotected against invasion and domestic violence. The\nfollowing passage is his justi\ufb01cation for prescribing the\npeculiar oath which he had made the condition of pardon:\n\u201cAn attempt to guarantee and protect a revived state\ngovernment, constructed in whole or in preponderating\npart from the very element against whose hostility and\nviolence it is to be protected, is simply absurd. There must\nbe a test by which to separate the opposing elements, so as\nto build only from the sound; and that test is a su\ufb00iciently\nliberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a\nsworn recantation of his former unsoundness. But, if it be\nproper to require, as a test of admission to the political\nbody, an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United\nStates and to the Union under it, why also to the laws and\nproclamations in regard to slavery? Those laws and\n proclamations were enacted, and put forth, for the purpose\nof aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them\ntheir fullest e\ufb00ect, there had to be a pledge for their\nmaintenance. In my judgment, they have aided and will\nfurther aid the cause for which they were intended. To now\nabandon them, would be not only to relinquish a lever of\npower, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach\nof faith. I may add, at this point, that while I remain in my\npresent position, I shall not attempt to retract, or modify,\nthe Emancipation Proclamation; nor shall I return to\nslavery any person who is free by the terms of that\nproclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress.\n\u201cFor these and other reasons, it is thought best that\nsupport of these measures shall be included in the oath;\nand it is believed that the Executive may lawfully claim it,\nin return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights,\nwhich he has a clear constitutional power to withhold\naltogether, or grant upon the terms which he shall deem\nwisest for the public interest. It should be observed, also,\nthat this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and\nabrogating power of legislation and supreme judicial\ndecision.\u201d\nThis proclamation was issued as a rallying point for those\nloyal or penitent elements which were believed to exist in\nmany of the insurgent states, and which, in the confusion of\nplans for reconstruction, were lying dormant, and without\npractical advantage to the states themselves and to the\ngovernment. He believed his plan of reconstruction would\n save labor, and avoid great confusion. On the th of\nMarch, , he issued a supplementary and explanatory\nproclamation, de\ufb01ning more carefully the cases in which\nrebels were to be pardoned, and the manner in which they\nwere to avail themselves of the bene\ufb01ts of the amnesty. He\nshut out many from the bene\ufb01ts of the proclamation,\nthough he excluded none from personal application to the\nPresident for clemency.\nThe action of Congress during this session was not of\nnotable importance. Important subjects were discussed at\nlength; but they were not embodied in measures, or, rather,\nthe measures sought to be enacted were not successfully\ncarried through. A bill for the establishment of a Bureau of\nFreedmen\u2019s A\ufb00airs passed the House, but failed in the\nSenate; while a resolution to submit to a vote of the states\nan amendment of the Constitution, permanently prohibiting\nthe existence of slavery in the states and territories of the\nUnion, was passed by the Senate, but rejected by the\nHouse. The fugitive slave law \u2014 one of those compromise\nmeasures which were to silence the anti-slavery agitation\nforever, and be a \ufb01nal settlement of the slavery question \u2014\nwas repealed, with surprising ease and unanimity. A heated\ndebate occurred upon a resolution introduced by Speaker\nColfax, for the expulsion from the House of Alexander Long\nof Ohio, for declaring himself in favor of recognizing the\nrebel confederacy. A two-thirds vote being necessary for\nthe purpose of the resolution, and this vote not being\nobtainable, the mover contented himself with a substitute,\ndeclaring Mr. Long an unworthy member of the House.\n During the discussion of the resolution, Mr. Harris of\nMaryland thanked God that the South had not yet been\nbrought into subjection, and prayed God that it might not\nbe; and straightway a resolution was introduced for his\nexpulsion, which failed of passage by lack of the requisite\ntwo-thirds vote. He was, however, \u201cseverely censured;\u201d\nand, although no extreme measures were e\ufb00ected in these\ncases, the debate had a healthy in\ufb02uence, in de\ufb01ning the\nboundaries of legitimate debate on the great questions\nwhich agitated the country.\nAn outcropping of the Missouri imbroglio showed itself\nabove the surface during the session. General F.P. Blair\nresigned his seat in the House, and resumed his place in\nthe army, at the close of a discussion introduced by one of\nhis colleagues, who charged him with improprieties in the\nadministration of a\ufb00airs in his department. Although he\ncleared himself of the charges, the House called upon the\nPresident for an explanation of his restoration to command.\nThe President gave them a reply at length, and frankly\nstated all the circumstances of the case. The two facts\nwhich the letter and all the correspondence in the case\nreveal most prominently, were, that Mr. Lincoln had a\nstrong personal friendship for General Blair, and a \ufb01rm\nbelief in his anti-slavery principles and sentiments; and that\nhe wished him to be where he could do the government the\nmost good in the prosecution of the war. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nrepresentation of the case was, that General Blair and\nGeneral Schenck of Ohio, having been elected to Congress,\nwere permitted to resign their commissions, and take their\n seats, with the distinct verbal understanding with the\nPresident and the Secretary of War that they might, at their\npleasure, withdraw their resignations, leave their places in\nthe House, and return to the \ufb01eld. It is apparent that Mr.\nLincoln wished for General Blair\u2019s aid in the organization of\nthe House, and, after that, in the \ufb01eld, if he could be most\nuseful to the government there. The arrangement seems to\nhave been a little irregular, though entered upon with the\nbest motives. It was one of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s short cuts out of\nthe labyrinth of \u201cred tape,\u201d in which it was always di\ufb00icult\nfor him to walk. In a letter which he wrote to Montgomery\nBlair, he revealed one of the motives which actuated him in\nmaking the arrangement. \u201cIt will relieve him (the General)\nfrom a dangerous position, or a misunderstanding,\u201d said he,\n\u201cas I think he is in danger of being permanently separated\nfrom those with whom only he can ever have a real\nsympathy \u2014 the sincere opponents of slavery.\u201d\nA measure which time has proved to be of great\nimportance was the restoration of the grade of Lieutenant-\ngeneral, with reference to investing General Grant with the\nchief command of the armies of the United States. His\nappointment to this o\ufb00ice, by the President, was an\nexpression of the popular con\ufb01dence in his devotion to the\nnational cause, and his transcendent ability as a military\nman. In presenting him with his commission, Mr. Lincoln\ntook occasion to say: \u201cThe expression of the nation\u2019s\napprobation of what you have already done, and its reliance\non you for what remains to do, in the existing struggle, is\nnow presented with this commission, constituting you\n Lieutenant-general of the armies of the United States.\u201d The\nmodest General made a \ufb01tting response: \u201cI feel the full\nweight of the responsibilities now devolving on me; and I\nknow that, if they are met, it will be due to those armies,\nand above all to the favor of that Providence which leads\nboth nations and men.\u201d Fit o\ufb00icer with \ufb01t superior! Two\nsimpler-hearted, truer men than President Lincoln and\nLieutenant-general Grant, have not been produced by the\nrepublic; and, in their hands, unweakened by sel\ufb01sh\nambition, and entirely consecrated to the work of saving\nthe country, the cause of nationality, freedom, and humanity\nwas destined to a glorious triumph. The victories of both\nhad been victories of character. Not brilliant gifts, but a\nnoble spirit had made the President a mighty man. Neither\nthe courage of the brute nor the dash of the cavalier had\nmade General Grant a great soldier; but a devoted purpose\nand a will of iron had crowned him with the name and\nenrobed him with the prestige of the greatest general\nliving.\nAn incident occurred on the th of April, , which\nforcibly illustrated the progress, not only of events, but of\nideas. A grand fair, for the bene\ufb01t of the United States\nSanitary Commission, the original and leading charity\nestablished to mitigate the immediate horrors of war, was\nheld in Baltimore; and one of the attractions was the\npresence and the voice of President Lincoln. Three years\nhad introduced and con\ufb01rmed great changes. Three years\nbefore this occasion, he was obliged to pass through the\ncity in the night, to escape assassination. Three years\n before, \nthe \nMassachusetts \nSixth, \nhastening \nto \nthe\nprotection of Washington, had left some of their members\ndead in the streets. Three years before, the whole city was\nseething with treason. Now, gold was pouring into the\ntreasury of the great charity which had been established to\naid the soldiers of the Union; and the President was\nwelcomed to the city with grateful gladness.\nThere was a large crowd, and, in the anxiety to get a\nglimpse of Mr. Lincoln and to hear his voice, great\nconfusion; but enough of his remarks have been preserved\nto give an idea of their drift and spirit. \u201cCalling it to mind\nthat we are in Baltimore,\u201d said he, \u201cwe cannot fail to note\nthat the world moves. Looking upon the many people I see\nassembled here, to serve as they best may the soldiers of\nthe Union, it occurs to me that three years ago those\nsoldiers could not pass through Baltimore. I would say,\nblessings upon the men who have wrought these changes,\nand the women who have assisted them!\u201d These allusions\nto the changes in Baltimore were heartily applauded by the\nBaltimoreans; and, when he proceeded to the mention of\nchanges which had been wrought upon the institution of\nslavery, \nthe \napplause \nwas \nstill \nmore \nhearty \nand\nenthusiastic. Maryland had practically abolished the\ninstitution; and the President thanked her for what she had\ndone and what she was doing.\nA month or two later, the President attended another fair\nof the Sanitary Commission at Philadelphia. Of course,\nthese movements were not entered upon to gratify a love of\nexcitement or a desire for display, but to manifest his\n friendliness to the bene\ufb01cent purposes of the commission.\nHere a grand supper was given; and, in response to a toast,\nMr. Lincoln made a brief speech. Opening with an allusion\nto the terrors and burdens of war, he spoke of the two great\nassociations which had done so much to relieve the soldier,\nin the \ufb01eld and in the hospital, and paid a grateful tribute\nto the ministry of woman in the great work of alleviating\nthe su\ufb00ering of the army. Speaking of the generous\noutpouring of means for sustaining these charities, he said:\n\u201cThey are voluntary contributions, giving proof that the\nnational resources are not at all exhausted, and that the\nnational patriotism will sustain us through all.\u201d Here, as\nalways and everywhere, the war was uppermost in his\nmind. \u201cIt is a pertinent question,\u201d said he, \u201cWhen is the war\nto end? I do not wish to name a day when it will end, lest\nthe end should not come at the given time. We accepted the\nwar, and did not begin it. We accepted it for an object, and,\nwhen that object is accomplished, the war will end; and I\nhope to God it will never end until that object is\naccomplished. We are going through with our task, so far\nas I am concerned, if it takes us three years longer. I have\nnot been in the habit of making predictions, but I am\nalmost tempted now to hazard one. It is, that Grant is this\nevening in a position, with Meade and Hancock of\nPennsylvania, whence he can never be dislodged by the\nenemy, until Richmond is taken.\u201d Events that wait to be\nrecounted veri\ufb01ed the President\u2019s prediction.\nA fair for the bene\ufb01t of the soldiers, held at the Patent\nO\ufb00ice, in Washington, called out Mr. Lincoln as an\n interested visitor; and he was not permitted to retire\nwithout giving a word to those in attendance. \u201cIn this\nextraordinary war,\u201d said he, \u201cextraordinary developments\nhave manifested themselves, such as have not been seen in\nformer wars; and among these manifestations nothing has\nbeen more remarkable than these fairs for the relief of\nsu\ufb00ering soldiers and their families. And the chief agents in\nthese fairs are the women of America. I am not accustomed\nto the use of language of eulogy; I have never studied the\nart of paying compliments to women; but I must say that if\nall that has been said by orators and poets, since the\ncreation of the world, in praise of women, were applied to\nthe women of America, it would not do them justice for\ntheir conduct during this war. I will close by saying, God\nbless the women of America!\u201d\nThe government was pledged to the protection of its\nblack soldiers. The President felt that the matter involved\nmany di\ufb00iculties, for the government was not always able\nto protect them. When these soldiers were shown no\nquarter in battle, or when, as prisoners, they were killed or\nenslaved by the infuriated and unscrupulous foe, he who\ncould not prevent his white soldiers from starving to death\nin rebel prisons, could hardly protect the colored soldiers\nfrom the indignities which rebel policy and rebel spite\nin\ufb02icted upon them. But he did what he could. As early as\nJuly th, , he issued an order declaring that: \u201cThe\ngovernment of the United States will give the same\nprotection to all its soldiers; and, if the enemy shall sell or\nenslave anyone, because of his color, the o\ufb00ense shall be\n punished by retaliation upon the enemy\u2019s prisoners in our\npossession.\u201d Proceeding, he de\ufb01nitely ordered, \u201cthat for\nevery soldier of the United States killed in violation of the\nlaws of war, a rebel soldier should (shall) be executed; and\nfor every one enslaved by the enemy, or sold into slavery, a\nrebel soldier should (shall) be placed at hard labor on the\npublic works, and continued at such labor until the other\nshould (shall) be released, or receive such treatment as was\n(is, or may be) due to a prisoner of war.\u201d This matter of\nretaliation was brought up during Mr. Lincoln\u2019s speech at\nthe Baltimore Fair, to which allusion has been made in this\nchapter. He had just heard the rumor of the massacre of\nblack soldiers and white o\ufb00icers at Fort Pillow. His mind\nwas full of the horrible event; and, as his custom was, he\nspoke of that which interested him most. The public\nthought the government was not doing its whole duty in\nthis matter. For the measure which put the black man into\nthe war, he declared himself responsible to the American\npeople, the future historian, and, above all, to God; and he\ndeclared that the black soldier ought to have, and should\nhave, the same protection given to the white soldier. His\nclosing words were:\n\u201cIt is an error to say that the government is not acting in\nthis matter. The government has no direct evidence to\ncon\ufb01rm the reports in existence relative to this massacre,\nbut I believe the facts in relation to it to be as stated. When\nthe government does know the facts from o\ufb00icial sources,\nand they prove to substantiate the reports, retribution will\nbe surely given. What is reported, I think, will make a clear\n case. If it is not true, then all such stories are to be\nconsidered as false. If proved to be true, when the matter\nshall be thoroughly examined, what shape is to be given to\nthe retribution? Can we take the man who was captured at\nVicksburg, and shoot him for the victim of this massacre? If\nit should happen that it was the act of only one man, what\ncourse is to be pursued then? It is a matter requiring\ncareful examination and deliberation; and, if it shall be\nsubstantiated by su\ufb00icient evidence, all may rest assured\nthat retribution will be had.\u201d\nAnd now we leave these minor matters, for the\nconsideration of great and decisive events, concerning alike\nthe life of Mr. Lincoln and the life of the nation.\n   ha ter    II.\nTHE \nYEAR \n \nwas \ndistinguished \nby \ntwo \ngrand\ncampaigns: one, political; the other, military: and, as the\nlatter did not terminate with the year, it is well, perhaps, to\ngive the former the precedence in the record. After four\nyears, marked by mighty changes in the nation, the year of\nthe presidential election had come again. It came in with\ndoubt and darkness. The country was feeling the distresses\nof the war, and was wincing under the drafts made upon its\nvital and \ufb01nancial resources. Call after call for men had\nbeen made. Draft after draft had been enforced. Taxation\nbrought home the burden to every man\u2019s door; and still no\nend appeared. Still the rebel confederacy seemed full of\nvitality; still it commanded immense resources of men and\nmaterial; still its spirit and its words were uncompromising\nand de\ufb01ant. During four years of administration, Mr.\nLincoln had made many enemies, among those who had\noriginally supported him; and the democratic party were\nnot scrupulous in the use of means to bring him into\ndisrepute with the people. Many republicans su\ufb00ered under\nprivate grievances. Their counsels had not been su\ufb00iciently\nfollowed; their friends had not been properly served. Some\nthought Mr. Lincoln had been too fast and too severe in his\nmeasures; others thought that he had been too slow. All\nthis was to have been expected; and it may well be\n imagined that no decision as to the true policy of the\nrepublican party, in its nominations, could have been made,\nwithout an exhibition of all the elements of discord.\nThat this period had been anticipated by friends and\nenemies abroad as one of the most terrible tests to which\nthe republican institutions of the country had been or could\nbe subjected, was evident. We were called upon in the very\nheat of civil war \u2014 that war involving questions upon which\neven the loyal portion of the country was almost evenly\ndivided \u2014 to elect a president for four years. With immense\narmies in the \ufb01eld and immense navies a\ufb02oat, \u2014 with fresh\ndrafts for troops threatened or in progress, \u2014 with discord\namong the friends of the government and the foes of the\nrebellion, \u2014 and with a watchful opposition, skilled in party\nwarfare, taking advantage of every mistake of the\ngovernment and every success of its enemies, to push its\nown fortunes in the strife for power, \u2014 it is not strange that\ncool observers looked doubtfully upon the result, as it\nrelated to the power of a republican government to take\ncare of itself, and maintain its hold upon the nation and its\nplace among the governments of the world. How well the\npeople behaved in this startling emergency, the calm\ndiscussions of the presidential campaign, the solemn and\nconscientious manner of the people at the polls, the\ntriumph of the national arms, and the present peace and\nstability of the country, bear witness.\nMr. Chase, the distinguished Secretary or the Treasury,\nhad his friends, and they were many and powerful. General\nFremont had also his friends, who felt that he had not been\n well treated by the administration, and who were anxious\nfor a diversion in his favor. Although both of these\ngentlemen had strong adherents among the politicians, and\nalthough either of them would have been cordially\nsupported by the people under favorable circumstances, it\nwas abundantly evident that the great masses of the people\nwere in favor of Mr. Lincoln. He had had experience, and\nhad grown wise under its in\ufb02uence. His unobtrusive\ncharacter and his unbending honesty had won their\ncon\ufb01dence; and, although the future looked dark, they were\nconscious that progress had been made toward the\ndestruction of the rebellion, and that, if the policy of war\nshould be pursued, it would inevitably ultimate in the\nnational success. They were convinced, also, that the way\nto a permanent peace was through war. Under these\ncircumstances, they were reluctant to change leaders and\nrulers. The result was, that, at an early day, Mr. Chase\nwithdrew his name from the list of candidates, and left\nmuch of the disa\ufb00ected element a\ufb02oat.\nOutside of the republican and democratic parties, there\nwas no organization; and, to institute one, an irresponsible\ncall was issued, for a convention to be held at Cleveland,\nOhio, on the thirty-\ufb01rst of May. The call represented that\nthe public liberties were in danger, and declared for the\n\u201cone-term principle,\u201d by which Mr. Lincoln should be set\naside, however e\ufb00iciently he might have served the\ngovernment. The regular convention of the republican\nparty, which was to be held at Baltimore on the eighth of\nJune, was denounced in the call, as failing to answer the\n conditions of a truly national convention, in consequence of\nits proximity to \u201cadministrative in\ufb02uence.\u201d\nThe people recognized this call to be simply what it, in\nreality, was \u2014 an anti-Lincoln demonstration; and paid no\nattention to it, except in one or two instances. The Germans\nof Missouri did something by way of indorsement; as did\nalso a few radicals elsewhere, who had really never been\nmembers of the republican party proper.\nThe convention was held at the appointed time; and it\nbrought together an insigni\ufb01cant number of politicians,\nself-appointed to their seats in the convention. It was, in no\nsense, the o\ufb00spring of the popular feeling or conviction;\nand its action found no response in the popular heart.\nFremont\u2019s \nname \nformed \nthe \nrallying \npoint \nof \nthe\nconvention. Wendell Phillips and Frederick Douglass sent\nletters to it. Mrs. E. Cady Stanton approved of the\nconvention in a letter. John Cochrane presided, and was\nhonored with the nomination for Vice-president, on the\nticket with General Fremont. The platform adopted dealt\nbrie\ufb02y with generalities, condemning no person save by\nimplication, and containing no vital element which had not\nalready been appropriated by the mass of republicans\nthroughout the nation. Although the convention was\norganized and engineered to bring an in\ufb02uence to bear\nupon the Baltimore Convention, it failed to have in\ufb02uence\nanywhere.\nThe saddest feature of the whole movement was General\nFremont\u2019s connivance with it, when he could not but see\nthat its only in\ufb02uence would be to divide the friends of the\n government; and the eagerness with which he accepted his\nnomination. He opened his letter of acceptance by speaking\nof the convention as an assemblage of the \u201crepresentatives\nof the people,\u201d when he ought to have known that they\nwere nothing of the kind. General Fremont, it is to be\nremembered here, was the republican candidate for the\npresidency eight years before, receiving the honor of every\nrepublican vote. The party had once been beaten with him\nfor its standard-bearer; and, if he had been thoroughly\nmagnanimous, he would have remembered it. At the\nopening of the war, Mr. Lincoln had given him the highest\nmilitary commission he had it in his power to bestow; and,\nafter his Missouri failure, he had created a department for\nhim. In this, he had not won distinguished honor; and\nwhen, at last, he was subordinated to another General, to\nmeet the conditions of a great emergency, he threw up his\nposition on a point of etiquette, and retired from his\ncommand. Mr. Lincoln had found it very di\ufb00icult to please\nthe General, or to satisfy his friends. The President was\nsupposed to be jealous of him; and, if the readers of the life\nof Mr. Lincoln are not already convinced that such jealousy\ncould have no place in him, no present attempt to vindicate\nhis motives will avail. The truth was that Mr. Lincoln\nentertained none but the kindliest feelings toward him,\nthough it is doubtful whether he had great con\ufb01dence in his\nadministrative and military ability. General Fremont knew,\nof course, that the little band of men gathered at Cleveland\ndid not represent the republican party; and he knew that\nthe republican party loved Mr. Lincoln. The party had been\n true \nto \nGeneral \nFremont, \neven \nif \nthey \nhad \nbeen\ndisappointed in him. When he undertook to stab the o\ufb00icial\nreputation of the President, he was engaged in the attempt\nto ruin the chosen man of the republican party. \u201cHad Mr.\nLincoln remained faithful to the principles he was elected\nto defend, no schism could have been created, and no\ncontest could have been possible,\u201d said the General in his\nletter. Had the people decided that Mr. Lincoln was\nfaithless to the principles he was chosen to defend? Had\nthe republican party so decided? \u201cThe ordinary rights\nsecured under the Constitution and laws of the country\nhave been violated,\u201d continued the General. He charged the\nadministration with managing the war for personal ends,\nwith \u201cincapacity and sel\ufb01shness,\u201d with \u201cdisregard of\nconstitutional rights,\u201d with \u201cviolation of personal liberty\nand the liberty of the press,\u201d and with \u201cfeebleness and want\nof principle.\u201d Among the objects of the convention itself; he\nrecognized the e\ufb00ort \u201cto arouse the attention of the\npeople\u201d to certain alleged facts, which he had enumerated;\n\u201cand to bring them to realize that, while we are saturating\nsouthern soil with the best blood of the country, in the\nname of liberty, we have really parted with it at home.\u201d His\nown preference, he declared, would be to aid in the\nelection of some one, other than Mr. Lincoln, who might be\nnominated at Baltimore, \u201cBut if Mr. Lincoln should be\nnominated,\u201d said he, \u201cas I believe it would be fatal to the\ncountry to indorse a policy and renew a power which has\ncost us the lives of thousands of men, and needlessly put\nthe country on the road to bankruptcy, there will be no\n other alternative but to organize against him every element\nof conscientious opposition, with the view to prevent the\nmisfortune of his re-election.\u201d\nGeneral Fremont, virtuous above his party, virtuous\nabove Mr. Lincoln, quick to see encroachments upon the\nrights of the people in advance of the people themselves,\nready to \ufb01nd personal motives in the management of the\nwar by the administration, and himself, of course, acting\nsolely upon principle, failed to be appreciated by those\nwhose good he so tenderly sought. The republican party\ngave him no response, other than at once and forever to\ncount him out of its con\ufb01dence and a\ufb00ections. Convention,\nplatform, and candidates were early counted among\npolitical lumber; and whether the General at last withdrew\nfrom the \ufb01eld as a matter of principle, or from personal\nconsiderations, does not appear. He withdrew his name\nfrom the list of candidates before the people in September,\nafter it became evident to everybody that his position was a\ndamage to the national cause, administering a parting\nthrust at Mr. Lincoln in the words: \u201cIn respect to Mr.\nLincoln, I continue to hold exactly the sentiments contained\nin \nmy \nletter \nof \nacceptance. \nI \nconsider \nthat \nhis\nadministration has been politically and \ufb01nancially a failure,\nand that its necessary continuance is a cause of regret for\nthe country.\u201d General Fremont, an old favorite of the\nrepublican party, and a man who virtually claimed to be a\nbetter republican than the majority of his party, said this,\nand said it with a purpose, or, wantonly, without a purpose,\nwhen he knew that the alternative of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s election\n was the election of General McClellan, on a peace platform,\nsupported by such patriots as Fernando Wood and Clement\nL. Vallandigham.\nFour days before the date appointed for the assembling\nof the Baltimore Convention, a meeting was held in New\nYork to do honor to General Grant. The General had not\nthen concluded the war, and had not, in fact, met with\ndecisive successes with the army of the Potomac. There\nwas no special occasion for the meeting, except to\nin\ufb02uence the Baltimore Convention in the selection of a\ncandidate. To cover their real intent, they invited Mr.\nLincoln to attend; and he sent the following letter in\nresponse:\n\u201cGentlemen \u2014 Your letter inviting me to be present at a\nmass meeting of the loyal citizens, to be held at New York\non the fourth inst., for the purpose of expressing gratitude\nto Lieutenant-general Grant for his signal services, was\nreceived yesterday. It is impossible for me to attend. I\napprove, nevertheless, whatever may tend to strengthen\nand sustain General Grant and the noble armies now under\nhis direction. My previous high estimate of General Grant\nhas been maintained and heightened by what has occurred\nin the remarkable campaign he is now conducting; while\nthe magnitude and di\ufb00iculty of the task before him does not\nprove less than I expected. He and his brave soldiers are\nnow in the midst of their great trial; and I trust that, at\nyour meeting, you will so shape your good words that they\nmay turn to men and guns moving to his and their support.\n\u201cYours truly, A. Lincoln.\u201d\n The cordial tone of the President toward the General,\ne\ufb00ectually neutralized the object of the meeting; and, when\nthe Baltimore Convention met, on the eighth of June, there\nwas no name but that of the President that found\nadherents. Many of the delegates had come instructed to\nvote for him, from the conventions which sent them. Rev.\nRobert J. Breckinridge of Kentucky, a stern and eloquent\nold Unionist, was chosen temporary chairman; and Hon.\nWilliam Dennison of Ohio was elected to be the permanent\npresident of the convention. On the following day, Mr.\nHenry J. Raymond of New York, as chairman of the\ncommittee on resolutions, presented the platform, which\nwas adopted with warm approval, and with entire\nunanimity. It pledged the convention, and those it\nrepresented, to aid the government in quelling by force of\narms the rebellion then raging against its authority;\napproved the determination of the government not to\ncompromise with rebels in arms; indorsed the acts and\nproclamations \nagainst \nslavery, \nand \nadvocated \na\nconstitutional amendment abolishing it; returned thanks to\nthe soldiers of the Union armies, and declared that the\nnation owed a permanent provision for those disabled by\nthe war; approved of the administration of Mr. Lincoln and\nthe acts and measures which he had adopted for the\npreservation of the nation against its open and secret foes;\ndeclared that the government owed protection to all its\nsoldiers, without distinction of color; a\ufb00irmed that the\nnational faith, pledged for the redemption of the public\ndebt, must be kept inviolate; and expressed approval of the\n position taken by the government that the people of the\nUnited States can never regard with indi\ufb00erence the\nattempt of any European power to overthrow by force, or to\nsupplant by fraud, the institutions of any republican\ngovernment on the Western Continent.\nAfter the adoption of the resolutions, came the ballot for\na presidential candidate. At the \ufb01rst ballot, every vote was\ngiven for Mr. Lincoln, except the twenty-two from Missouri\nwhich, under instructions, were given for General Grant;\nbut the nomination was made unanimous on the motion of\none of the Missouri delegates. Mr. Hamlin, the incumbent\nof the vice-presidential o\ufb00ice, though an able and excellent\nman, was, from motives of policy, not regarded by many as\nthe best candidate for that o\ufb00ice; and Andrew Johnson of\nTennessee received the nomination.\nA single resolution in the platform, to which no allusion\nis made in the foregoing summary of its leading features,\ncovertly demanded a change in the cabinet. The words,\n\u201cWe deem it essential to the general welfare that harmony\nshould prevail in our national councils, and we regard as\nworthy of con\ufb01dence and o\ufb00icial trust those only who\ncordially indorse the principles proclaimed in these\nresolutions,\u201d were intended as an intimation that the\nconvention would like to have the President dismiss the\nPostmaster-general, Montgomery Blair. The resolution was\nprobably a concession to the Loyal Leagues, which,\noriginally friendly to the nomination of Mr. Chase, took up\nthe di\ufb00erences which were understood to exist between\nthese two members of the cabinet, and demanded that Mr.\n Blair should retire. A committee consisting of John M.\nAshley, John Covode and George S. Boutwell, waited upon\nthe President, on one occasion, to urge Mr. Blair\u2019s\ndismissal; and on that occasion Mr. Lincoln said that, if he\nshould be re-elected, he should probably make some\nchanges in his cabinet \u2014 a reply which they took as an\nassent to their request, and so reported to the body that\nsent them. When the resolution in question appeared in the\nplatform, Mr. Blair, understanding it, placed his resignation\nin the hands of the President, who delayed his acceptance\nof it until circumstances rendered the step desirable.\nWashington was but a short distance from Baltimore; and\nGovernor Dennison, the president of the convention, waited\nupon Mr. Lincoln, accompanied by a committee, to inform\nhim of his nomination. After receiving the formal address of\nthat gentleman, with a copy of the resolutions which had\nbeen adopted, Mr. Lincoln said:\n\u201cHaving served four years in the depths of a great and\nyet unended national peril, I can view this call to a second\nterm in nowise more \ufb02attering to myself than as an\nexpression of the public judgment that I may better \ufb01nish a\ndi\ufb00icult work, in which I have labored from the \ufb01rst, than\ncould any one less severely schooled to the task. In this\nview, and with assured reliance on that Almighty Ruler who\nhas so graciously sustained us thus far, and with increased\ngratitude to the generous people for their continued\ncon\ufb01dence, I accept the renewed trust, with its yet onerous\nand perplexing duties and responsibilities.\u201d\n During the same day, the President was waited upon by a\ncommittee of the Union League, which came with a tender\nof the congratulations, and a pledge of the con\ufb01dence and\nsupport, of that organization; and, in the evening, by the\nOhio \ndelegation \nin \nthe \nconvention. \nTo \nboth \nthese\ndeputations he addressed brief remarks, in the spirit of\nthose quoted as addressed to the committee of the\nconvention. Some days subsequently, he received the\nformal noti\ufb01cation, by letter, of his nomination, to which, on\nthe twenty-seventh of June, he replied as follows:\n\u201cGentlemen: \u2014 Your letter of the fourteenth inst.,\nformally notifying me that I have been nominated by the\nconvention you represent for the Presidency of the United\nStates, for four years from the fourth of March next, has\nbeen received. The nomination is gratefully accepted, as\nthe resolutions of the convention, called the platform, are\nheartily approved. While the resolution in regard to the\nsupplanting of republican governments upon the Western\nContinent \nis \nfully \nconcurred \nin, \nthere \nmight \nbe\nmisunderstanding were I not to say that the position of the\ngovernment in relation to the action of France in Mexico, as\nassumed through the State Department, and indorsed by\nthe convention among the measures and acts of the\nExecutive, will be faithfully maintained so long as the state\nof facts shall leave that position pertinent and applicable. I\nam especially grati\ufb01ed that the soldier and seaman were\nnot forgotten by the convention, as they forever must and\nwill be remembered by the grateful country, for whose\nsalvation they devote their lives.\n \u201cThanking you for the kind and complimentary terms in\nwhich you have communicated the nomination and other\nproceedings of the convention, I subscribe myself,\n\u201cYour obedient servant,\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln.\u201d\nIt was still more than two months before the assembling\nof the Democratic Convention, announced to be held at\nChicago on the twenty-ninth of August. This convention had\nbeen deferred, with the con\ufb01dent expectation, if not the\nhope, that the events of the war would prepare the people\nto accept a peace policy, and leave the party free to take\ndirect issue with the administration. During this interval, a\npeculiar change came over the spirit of the friends of Mr.\nLincoln. Opening the campaign with perfect con\ufb01dence\nconcerning the results, a feeling of distrust and doubt crept\nover them; and, without any apparent cause, the thought\nbecame prevalent that a mistake had been made in the\nnomination. This arose partly from the consciousness that\nthe country was really tired of a war of which they saw\nneither the end nor the signs of its approach; and partly\nfrom the uncertainty which prevailed concerning the action\nof the Democratic Convention, which was pretty sure to be\nbased upon the results of military movements in progress,\nand of dubious issue. It was one of those strange and\nunaccountable contagions of public feeling and opinion\nwhich start, no man knows where; lead, no man knows\nwhither; and die, at last, by no man\u2019s hand. Men did not\ncatch it from newspapers, did not contract it from\nspeeches, did not imbibe or absorb it in facts; but,\n simultaneously \nand \nuniversally, \nthe \nfriends \nof \nthe\nadministration were a\ufb00ected with a distrust of the future\nand a doubt of the wisdom of their choice.\nThere were still divisions in their ranks, but these were\nnot formidable. Occasion was taken by the opposition press\nto magnify every mistake of the President and to condemn\nevery doubtful measure. One Arguelles, convicted in Cuba\nof selling part of a cargo of negroes, illicitly landed, which,\nas an o\ufb00icer of the Spanish army, he had captured, was\npermitted to be taken from New York, and carried back to\nthe island. This act \u2014 a thoroughly righteous one in the\nlight of humanity and justice \u2014 was regarded by the\nopposition as a denial of the right of asylum; and a good\ndeal of disturbance was created by it.\nEarly in July, Congress completed its action upon a plan\nof reconstruction, which it embodied in an elaborate bill. In\nthe preparation of this bill, Henry Winter Davis of Maryland\nand Benjamin F. Wade of Ohio were prominently active. A\ngood deal of time and discussion had been expended upon\nit, but it was passed and sent to the President less than one\nhour before the close of the session. He failed to approve it,\nand, on the eighth of July, issued a proclamation on the\nsubject. In this proclamation, the President declared that\nhe was unprepared, by a formal approval of the bill, to\ncommit himself to any single plan of reconstruction, or to\nset aside the free state governments already formed in\nArkansas and Louisiana on other plans. At the same time,\nhe was willing that the plan embodied in the bill should be\nrecognized as one among others; and so promulgated the\n bill itself, as a part of his proclamation. To the people of any\nrebel state who should adopt the plan provided by the bill,\nhe pledged the executive assistance. The action of the\nPresident in this matter exceedingly o\ufb00ended Messrs. Wade\nand Davis, who joined in a bitter manifesto against him,\nand published it in the New York Tribune of August \ufb01fth.\n\u201cThe President,\u201d they declared, \u201cby preventing this bill\nfrom becoming a law, holds the electoral votes of the rebel\nstates \nat \nthe \ndictation \nof \nhis \npersonal \nambition.\u201d\nFurthermore: \u201cA more studied outrage on the legislative\nauthority of the people, has never been perpetrated.\u201d In its\nattack upon Mr. Lincoln\u2019s motives, it was an o\ufb00ensive\npaper, and pained the friends of the administration no less\nthan it rejoiced its enemies.\nMr. Lincoln, himself, never permitted attacks of this\ncharacter to trouble him. If they were very bitter, he did not\nread them at all; and many men of mark who wrote things\nfor his particular eye, failed of their object utterly by his\nrefusal to read, or listen to, their fulminations. After the\nWade and Davis manifesto was issued, it was, on one\noccasion, the subject of conversation between him and a\nnumber of gentlemen who had called at the White House.\nAfter all the gentlemen had retired, save one, who was an\nintimate personal friend, Mr. Lincoln turned to him, and\nsaid: \u201cThe Wade and Davis matter troubles me very little.\nIndeed, I feel a good deal about it as the old man did about\nhis cheese, when his very smart boy found, by the aid of a\nmicroscope, that it was full of maggots. \u2018Oh father!\u2019\nexclaimed the boy, \u2018how can you eat that stu\ufb00? Just look in\n here, and see \u2019em wriggle!\u2019 The old man took another\nmouthful, and, putting his teeth into it, replied grimly: \u2018let\n\u2019em wriggle!\u2019\u201d\nThe evident anxiety of the people for peace was a subject\nof deep solicitude with the administration. Mr. Lincoln had\nno faith in the desire of the Richmond government for any\npeace which would be accepted by the loyal people of the\ncountry. It was, however, for the interest of the rebels to\ncreate a peace party in the northern states, in order to\nweaken the administration; and it was their policy to\nappear to be ready to make or receive propositions for\npeace. There were two things to which the administration\nwas, in all good faith, irrevocably committed, viz: the\nrestoration of the Union, under the Constitution, and the\nabolition of slavery. Without being false to his oath of o\ufb00ice\nand to the American people who had poured out life and\ntreasure to save the nation, and without being faithless to\nan oppressed race to whom he had pledged emancipation,\nMr. Lincoln could entertain no propositions for peace, and\ncould make none, which were not based on the essential\nconditions of national unity and freedom to the blacks. This\nstate of facts tied his hands; yet he was made by his\nenemies to appear to be averse to peace; and some of his\nfriends, of the more timid sort, felt that, unless he could be\nplaced in a di\ufb00erent light before the people, his chances of\nre-election were slender.\nOn the \ufb01fth of July, one W.C. Jewett wrote a letter from\nNiagara Falls to Horace Greeley of New York, stating that\nthere were, in Canada, two ambassadors of the rebel\n government, with full powers to negotiate a peace; and\nrequesting that Mr. Greeley proceed to Niagara for a\nconference, or secure from the President a safe-conduct for\nthem to New York. Mr. Greeley inclosed the letter to Mr.\nLincoln, remarking that he thought the matter deserved\nattention. He also wrote: \u201cI venture to remind you that our\nbleeding, bankrupt, almost dying country, longs for peace\n\u2014 shudders at the prospect of fresh conscriptions, of\nfurther wholesale devastations, and of new rivers of human\nblood; and a wide-spread conviction that the government\nand its supporters are not anxious for peace, and do not\nimprove pro\ufb00ered opportunities to achieve it, is doing great\nharm now, and is morally certain, unless removed, to do far\ngreater \nin \nthe \napproaching \nelections.\u201d \nMr. \nGreeley\nsubjoined to his letter a plan of adjustment which he\ndeemed proper and practicable, the \ufb01rst two items of which\ncovered the restoration of the Union and the abolition of\nslavery. Certainly, if these were leading and essential parts\nof the plan, it could make no di\ufb00erence whether they were\nmade conditions precedent to negotiation, or essentials in\nany adjustment to be procured by negotiation.\nThe President replied to this communication, on the\nninth: \u201cIf you can \ufb01nd any person, anywhere, professing to\nhave any proposition of Je\ufb00erson Davis, in writing,\nembracing the restoration of the Union and abandonment\nof slavery, whatever else it embraces, say to him that he\nmay come to me with you.\u201d On the thirteenth of July, Mr.\nGreeley wrote to the President, stating that he had\ninformation upon which he could rely, that two persons,\n duly commissioned and empowered to negotiate for a\npeace, were not far from Niagara Falls, and were desirous\nto confer with the President, or such persons as he might\nappoint. Their names were Clement C. Clay of Alabama and\nJacob Thompson of Mississippi. If these persons could be\npermitted to see Mr. Lincoln, they wished a safe-conduct\nfor themselves and for George N. Saunders to Washington.\nIn the course of the letter, Mr. Greeley said: \u201cI am, of\ncourse, quite other than sanguine that a peace can now be\nmade; but I am quite sure that a frank, earnest, anxious\ne\ufb00ort to terminate the war on honorable terms, would\nimmensely strengthen the government in case of its failure,\nand would help us in the eyes of the civilized world.\u201d\nGeorge N. Saunders wrote to Mr. Greeley on the twelfth,\nthat he was authorized to say that Mr. Clay and Professor\nHolcombe of Virginia were ready, with himself, to go to\nWashington, provided they should have a safe-conduct. To\nMr. Greeley\u2019s letter of the thirteenth, Mr. Lincoln replied on\nthe \ufb01fteenth: \u201cI am disappointed that you have not already\nreached here with those commissioners. If they would\nconsent to come on being shown my letter to you of the\nninth inst., show that and this to them; and, if they will\nconsent to come on the terms stated in the former, bring\nthem. I not only intend a sincere e\ufb00ort for peace, but I\nintend that you shall be a personal witness that it is made.\u201d\nThis note was taken to Mr. Greeley by Major Hay, who,\nhaving been empowered by telegraph to write a safe-\nconduct for the commissioners, embraced in his paper the\nnames \nof \nMessrs. \nClay, \nThompson, \nHolcombe, \nand\n Saunders. With this, Mr. Greeley started for Niagara Falls,\nand, on arriving there on the seventeenth, addressed to the\n\ufb01rst three of these gentlemen, at the Clifton House, on the\nCanada side of the river, a note, stating that he was\ninformed that they were duly accredited from Richmond as\nthe bearers of propositions looking to the establishment of\npeace; that he understood, also, that they desired to visit\nWashington in the ful\ufb01llment of their mission, and that they\nwished George N. Saunders to accompany them. If these\nwere the facts, he declared himself authorized by the\nPresident to o\ufb00er them a safe-conduct and to accompany\nthem.\nOn the following day, this note was replied to by Messrs.\nClay and Holcombe, who frankly acknowledged that the\nsafe-conduct of the President had been o\ufb00ered under a\nmisapprehension of facts. They were not accredited from\nRichmond at all, as the bearers of propositions looking to\nthe establishment of peace. They professed, however, to be\nin the con\ufb01dential employ of their government, and to be\nfamiliar with its wishes and opinions on the subject; and\nthey declared that, if the circumstances disclosed in the\ncorrespondence were communicated to Richmond, they, or\nothers, would at once be invested with the requisite\nauthority to negotiate. It should be remembered, at this\npoint, that these men had not been made fully acquainted\nwith the conditions on which the President had o\ufb00ered\nthem a safe-conduct. Mr. Greeley had evidently forgotten to\ninform them concerning the terms of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s letter of\nthe ninth, in which he promised a safe-conduct only to\n those who should be duly accredited with propositions for\npeace, conditioned upon the restoration of the Union and\nthe abolition of slavery. These, it must be remembered,\nwere the original and unaltered conditions on which Mr.\nLincoln had consented to receive them.\nMr. Greeley replied to Messrs. Clay and Holcombe, on\nthe eighteenth, that the state of facts di\ufb00ered materially\nfrom Mr. Lincoln\u2019s understanding of them, and that he\nshould telegraph for fresh instructions, which he did at\nonce. On receiving the dispatch, Mr. Lincoln sent Major\nHay to Niagara, with the following letter:\n\u201cExecutive Mansion, Washington, July th, .\n\u201cTo Whom It May Concern:\u2014 \u201cAny proposition which\nembraces the restoration of peace, the integrity of the\nwhole Union, and the abandonment of slavery, and which\ncomes by and with an authority that can control the armies\nnow at war against the United States, will be received and\nconsidered by the Executive government of the United\nStates, and will be met on liberal terms on substantial and\ncollateral points; and the bearer or bearers thereof shall\nhave safe-conduct both ways.\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln.\u201d\nMajor Hay, on his arrival at Niagara, went with Mr.\nGreeley to the Clifton House, and delivered the above\nmissive to Professor Holcombe. Then Mr. Greeley returned\nto New York, where he soon afterwards received the\nresponse of Messrs. Clay and Holcombe. Their letter was\nexactly what might have been expected. They had supposed\nthat a safe-conduct had been o\ufb00ered them on the ground\n that they were \u201cduly accredited from Richmond, as bearers\nof propositions looking to the establishment of peace;\u201d and,\nwhen they found conditions insisted on precedent to\nnegotiation, they could see only a \u201csudden and entire\nchange in the views of the President,\u201d and a \u201crude\nwithdrawal of a courteous overture for negotiation, at the\nmoment it was likely to be accepted.\u201d It will be noticed by\nthe reader that the President had made no change\nwhatever in his conditions from those \ufb01rst o\ufb00ered, and that\nthe letter of Clay and Holcombe left him in a false position.\nNothing appears in the correspondence, thus far published,\nto show that Mr. Greeley ever communicated to the\ncommissioners the President\u2019s original conditions for a\nsafe-conduct and an interview.\nIn order to place himself in a just position before the\ncountry, Mr. Lincoln applied to Mr. Greeley for permission\nto publish the entire correspondence, omitting certain\nunessential passages in Mr. Greeley\u2019s letters, which\nrepresented the country as being on the verge of\ndestruction, \nintimated \nthe \npossibility \nof \na \nnorthern\ninsurrection, and alluded to the importance of a\ufb00ecting\nfavorably the North Carolina election. Mr. Greeley refused\nto have the correspondence published, unless these\npassages, which Mr. Lincoln thought would have a\nmischievous e\ufb00ect upon the public mind, should be\nretained. For the sake of the country and its cause, Mr.\nLincoln submitted; but, determined to stand right in history,\nhe sent a note to Henry J. Raymond, editor of the New York\nTimes, under date of August , , as follows:\n My Dear Sir: \u2014 I have proposed to Mr. Greeley that the\nNiagara correspondence be published, suppressing only the\nparts of his letters over which the red pencil is drawn in the\ncopy which I herewith send. He declines giving his consent\nto the publication of his letters, unless these parts be\npublished with the rest. I have concluded that it is better\nfor me to submit, for the time, to the consequences of the\nfalse position in which I consider he has placed me, than to\nsubject the country to the consequences of publishing these\ndiscouraging and injurious parts. I send you this, and the\naccompanying copy, not for publication, but merely to\nexplain to you, and that you preserve them until their\nproper time shall come.\n\u201cYours truly,\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln.\u201d\nSo Mr. Lincoln went through the canvass with the\nimputation resting upon him of having pursued a vacillating\ncourse \nwith \nthe \nunaccredited \nand \nirresponsible\ncommissioners, and of repelling negotiations for peace. All\nthe capital that could be made against him from the\nmaterials furnished by the a\ufb00air, was assiduously used by\nthe opposition and by the rebels themselves.\nThe time for holding the National Democratic Convention\ncame at last. Still the fortunes of the military campaign\nwere undecided; and the country was groaning under\ne\ufb00orts to furnish men for the reinforcement of the armies.\nBut the President found aid in unexpected quarters. By the\ndirection of that Providence in which he so implicitly\nbelieved, every treasonable and personally inimical element\n in the nation became his ally. Mr. Vallandigham had\nreturned to the country before his time; and the President\npermitted him to remain, unmolested. He became one of\nthe pets of his party; and, attending the Chicago\nConvention as a delegate, was chosen chairman of the\ncommittee on resolutions. Governor Seymour of New York,\nhis \nsympathizing \nfriend, \nwas \nthe \npresident \nof \nthe\nconvention. Congressman Long of Ohio was also there, with\na full representation of all those who had, from the \ufb01rst,\nopposed the war, and sympathized with the rebellion. The\nplatform adopted was composed largely of negations,\ntouching the policy of the administration; but one thing it\ndistinctly demanded, viz: \u201ca cessation of hostilities.\u201d The\ncandidates nominated were General George B. McClellan\nfor President, and George H. Pendleton of Ohio for Vice-\nPresident. \nGeneral \nMcClellan \nwas \nnominally \na \nwar\ndemocrat, and Mr. Pendleton really a peace democrat. Both\nwings of the party were thus accommodated, while the\nplatform was all that the most extreme of peace men could\nask. But the convention did not dissolve; it adjourned,\n\u201csubject to be called at any time and place that the\nexecutive national committee shall designate.\u201d The act was\na threat, and betrayed the entertainment of possibilities\nand incidental purposes not entirely creditable to the\npatriotism of the convention. Mr. Vallandigham\u2019s tongue\nwas busy, in and out of the convention. He was treated as a\nman who had su\ufb00ered persecution for the sake of\ndemocratic truth. He moved that the nomination of\nMcClellan be made unanimous. He was active in all the\n a\ufb00airs of the occasion; and he did more than any other man\nto destroy the prospects of the democratic party.\nThe spirit manifested by the demagogues who managed\nthis convention, was not the spirit of the people, and not\nthe spirit of the democratic masses. The majority of the\ndemocratic party had supported the war. Many of the best\no\ufb00icers in the army were democrats, thoroughly devoted to\nthe destruction of the rebellion by military means. The\nvoice of the convention was, that all that had been\nexpended in the war, of life and treasure, should be\ndeclared a waste. The best illustration of the spirit of the\nconvention was found in the fact that, when it was\nannounced that Fort Morgan had surrendered, the news\nfell upon it like a pall. It awoke no cheers; and was so\nevidently unwelcome intelligence, although a great national\nsuccess, that the masses of the party were disgusted.\nWhatever may have been the acts, intentions and spirit of\nthe convention, this one thing was certain: that, from the\ntime of its adjournment, no sensible politician had any\ndoubt of the overwhelming triumph of the administration in\nthe election. The cloud was lifted from the republican party\nat once; and the democratic leaders themselves, though\nthey relaxed no e\ufb00ort, confessed that they were beaten,\nalmost from the start.\nOn the twenty-third of September, Mr. Blair retired from\nthe cabinet, in consequence of an intimation from the\nPresident that his retirement would be a relief to him. It\nwill be remembered that the Baltimore platform contained\na resolution which was intended to indicate a desire on the\n part of the convention that Mr. Blair should leave the\ncabinet; but Mr. Lincoln did not, probably, have any\nreference to this resolution in his action. Mr. Blair had\nmade an excellent Postmaster-general \u2014 one of the very\nbest who had administered the a\ufb00airs of his department;\nand it was Mr. Lincoln\u2019s policy to adhere to his friends, and\nespecially to those who did their duty. But there was a\ndi\ufb00iculty between Mr. Blair and Henry Winter Davis of\nMaryland, which, in Mr. Lincoln\u2019s judgment, endangered\nthe adoption of the free state constitution in that\ncommonwealth. He could solve the di\ufb00iculty, and help the\ncause, by permitting Mr. Blair, whose resignation had been\nin his hands for months, to retire. The President and the\nSecretary parted excellent friends; and Mr. Lincoln showed\nhis good will toward the retiring o\ufb00icer, by appointing to\nhis place ex-Governor William Dennison of Ohio, one of Mr.\nBlair\u2019s most intimate personal and family friends.\nA few days before this change in the cabinet, Mr. Lincoln\nwrote a letter to a convention of the friends of the new\nconstitution in Maryland, held in Baltimore on the\neighteenth of September, in which he expressed his earnest\nsolicitude for its adoption. \u201cIt needs not be a secret,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cand I presume it is no secret, that I wish success to\nthis provision.\u201d (The provision extinguishing slavery). \u201cI\ndesire it on every consideration. I wish to see all men free. I\nwish the national prosperity of the already free, which I feel\nsure the extinction of slavery would bring.\u201d The event he so\nmuch desired was consummated by a popular vote, on the\neighth and ninth of October; and the President was\n serenaded by the loyal Marylanders in Washington, as an\nexpression of their satisfaction and their congratulations.\nMr. Lincoln responded with a speech. An extract will show\nsomething of the subjects of public discussion at the time,\nas well as reveal the President\u2019s relation to them:\n\u201cSomething said by the Secretary of State, in his recent\nspeech at Auburn, has been construed by some into a\nthreat that, if I shall be beaten at the election, I will,\nbetween then and the constitutional end of my term, do\nwhat I may be able, to ruin the government. Others regard\nthe fact that the Chicago Convention adjourned not sine\ndie, but to meet again, if called to do so by a particular\nindividual, as the intimation of a purpose that, if their\nnominee shall be elected, he will at once seize control of\nthe government. I hope the good people will permit\nthemselves to su\ufb00er no uneasiness on either point. I am\nstruggling to maintain the government, not to overthrow it.\nI \nam \nstruggling \nspecially \nto \nprevent \nothers \nfrom\noverthrowing it. I, therefore, say that, if I live, I shall\nremain President until the fourth of next March, and that\nwhoever shall be constitutionally elected in November shall\nbe duly installed as President on the fourth of March; and,\nin the interval, I shall do my utmost that whoever is to hold\nthe helm for the next voyage, shall start with the best\npossible chance of saving the ship.\u201d\nThe October elections indicated the inevitable result of\nthe presidential canvass; and the successful movements of\nthe armies con\ufb01rmed the prospects of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s signal\ntriumph. The e\ufb00orts of the rebels south of the Union lines,\n and over the Canada boundary, to assist the peace party,\nand \nfurnish \ncapital \nfor \nits \noperations, \naided \nby\norganizations of disloyal elements within the loyal states,\nnot only failed of their object, but helped to rally the\npopular feeling to the side of the administration.\nAn unpleasant incident of the canvass was the result of\nan interview between Mr. Lincoln and a committee of the\nopposition party in Tennessee. Andrew Johnson, the present\nPresident of the United States, was then military governor\nof that state; and under his sanction a convention was\ncalled, to reorganize the state, that it might take a part in\nthe presidential election. This convention prescribed the\nform of an oath, that the body deemed proper for those to\ntake who desired to vote. Governor Johnson ordered the\nelection to be held, in accordance with the plan of the\nconvention; and adopted its oath. The oath was one which\nno heartily loyal man would refuse to take, unless he should\nobject to the following clause: \u201cI will cordially oppose all\narmistices and negotiations for peace with rebels in arms,\nuntil the Constitution of the United States, and all laws and\nproclamations made in pursuance thereof, shall be\nestablished over all the people of every state and territory,\nembraced within the national Union.\u201d No man, of course,\nwho heartily believed in the peace doctrine of the Chicago\nplatform could take the oath; and there were evidently\nmany men in Tennessee who would not subscribe to\nanother clause \u2014 men who could not heartily say: \u201cI\nsincerely rejoice in the triumph of the armies and navies of\nthe United States.\u201d\n Against this oath, a committee of General McClellan\u2019s\nfriends protested; and they bore their protest to the\nPresident. Mr. Lincoln did not receive the paper good-\nnaturedly. He undoubtedly regarded it as an attempt to get\nhim into di\ufb00iculty, and to make political capital against him.\nHe had no faith in the genuine loyalty of the men who\nwould not take the oath. He furthermore felt that it was a\nmatter with which he had no right to interfere, and\nbelieved it to be one which Mr. John Lellyett, the bearer of\nthe protest, knew he would not undertake to control. Under\nthese circumstances, and in the condition of nervous and\nmental irritability, to which all the latter part of his life was\nsubject, he save a reply which was not at all in his usual\nmanner, and which pained his friends quite as much as it\nrejoiced his foes. The answer, as reported by Mr. Lellyett,\nwas: \u201cI expect to let the friends of George B. McClellan\nmanage their side of this contest in their own way, and I\nwill manage my side of it in my way.\u201d The committee asked\nfor an answer in writing. \u201cNot now,\u201d replied Mr. Lincoln.\n\u201cLay those papers down here. I will give no other answer\nnow. I may or may not write something about this hereafter.\nI know you intend to make a point of this. But go ahead;\nyou have my answer.\u201d\nNow this was unquestionably an undigni\ufb01ed and\ninjudicious reply \u2014 one which the people would not receive\nwith any consideration of the irritable mood in which it was\nuttered, or the provocation, real or supposed, which\ninspired it. Under date of October twenty-second, he made\na reply in writing. His conclusion was that he could have\n nothing to do with the matter. The action of the convention\nand of Governor Johnson was nothing which had been\ninspired by the national Executive. The Governor, he\nbelieved, had the right to favor any plan he might choose to\nfavor, which had been adopted by the loyal citizens of\nTennessee; and the President could not see, in the plan\nadopted, \u201cany menace, or violence, or coercion towards\nanyone.\u201d If the people should vote for president, under this\nplan, it would neither belong to the President, nor yet to\nthe military Governor of Tennessee, to say whether the vote\nshould be received and counted, but to a department of the\ngovernment to which, under the Constitution, it was given,\nto decide. So, \u201cexcept to give protection against violence,\u201d\nhe declined to have anything to do with any presidential\nelection. The result was the withdrawal of the McClellan\nticket in that state, and renewed charges against the\nPresident of interfering in elections, with which he had thus\nrefused to interfere.\nNo headway could be made, however, against Mr.\nLincoln. The issue was too plain. Yet it is but just to say that\nit is doubtful whether the success of the McClellan ticket\nwould have produced an immediate armistice. Results in a\nmilitary point of view were too plainly in our hands, and the\ncountry was too thoroughly committed to the war for the\nre-establishment of the Union, to permit so disgraceful and\nruinous a proceeding. But the democratic party had\nconsented to place itself in the position it occupied, for the\nsake of winning power; and, when the people saw such men\nas Wood, and Long, and Pendleton, and Vallandigham, all\n pushing the fortunes of the democratic candidate, they lost\nfaith in the party, and determined to support the\nadministration, its policy, and its candidates. In the\nmeantime, Grant, Sherman and Sheridan were leading on\ntheir victorious armies, and the political voice of these\narmies was almost unanimous for the republican nominees.\nBefore taking leave of the canvass, to record its results,\nit is simple justice to Mr. Lincoln to place by the side of the\nTennessee case, his call for \ufb01ve hundred thousand men,\nmade on the eighteenth of July, to be drafted after the \ufb01fth\nof September, if they should not be furnished previous to\nthat date. His friends urged that the measure would be\nunpopular, and that it might cost him his election. His reply\nto every representation of this kind was that the men were\nneeded, that it was his duty to call for them, and that he\nshould call for them, whatever the e\ufb00ect might be upon\nhimself. Does any one believe that a man who could treat a\ngreat question like this so nobly and patriotically, would\nbusy himself with small politics in Tennessee, or connive\nwith any small politicians there, in a scheme for cheating\npatriotic men out of votes, for his own advantage?\nThe day of election came at last, and resulted in an\noverwhelming majority of votes for Abraham Lincoln. Every\nstate that voted, except three, gave majorities for the\nrepublican candidate, and two of these three were old slave\nstates \u2014 Kentucky and Delaware. Only New Jersey among\nthe northern states gave its vote for McClellan. West\nVirginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana supported Mr.\nLincoln. The time had come, at last, of which he had spoken\n in Cooper Institute, more than four years before, when the\nrepublican party had ceased to be sectional, by obtaining\nsupport in the southern states. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s clear popular\nmajority was ,, in a total vote of ,,, which\nsecured  of the  votes in the electoral college.\nThe President might well feel grati\ufb01ed with this result.\nHis policy, motives, character and achievements had\nreceived the emphatic approval of the American people. \u201cI\nam thankful to God for this approval of the people,\u201d said he,\non the night of his election, to a band of Pennsylvanians\nwho had called upon him; and he added: \u201cBut, while deeply\ngrateful for this mark of their con\ufb01dence in me, if I know\nmy heart, my gratitude is free from any taint of personal\ntriumph. I do not impugn the motives of anyone opposed to\nme. It is no pleasure to me to triumph over any one; but I\ngive thanks to the Almighty for this evidence of the\npeople\u2019s resolution to stand by free government, and the\nrights of humanity.\u201d\nThe election proved more than Mr. Lincoln\u2019s popularity;\nand this he understood. In subsequent remarks to the\nfriendly political clubs of the District, he said: \u201cIt has\ndemonstrated that a people\u2019s government can sustain a\nnational election in the midst of a great civil war. Until now,\nit has not been known to the world that this was a\npossibility. It shows, also, how strong and sound we still\nare... It shows, also, to the extent yet known, that we have\nmore men now, than we had when the war began. Gold is\ngood in its place; but living, brave and patriotic men are\nbetter than gold.\u201d To a friend he said: \u201cBeing only mortal,\n after all, I should have been a little morti\ufb01ed if I had been\nbeaten in this canvass before the people; but that sting\nwould have been more than compensated by the thought\nthat the people had noti\ufb01ed me that all my o\ufb00icial\nresponsibilities were soon to be lifted o\ufb00 my back.\u201d\nThe election of Mr. Lincoln destroyed the last hope of the\nrebellion. There was to be no change of policy; and none\ncould know better than the rebel leaders that that policy\ncould not be long resisted. These leaders were little\ninclined to make peace; and it is doubtful whether their\npeople would have permitted them to do so. They had\npromised their people independence; and the latter had\nfought with wonderful bravery and persistency for it. There\nwas no way but to \ufb01ght on, until the inevitable defeat\nshould come.\nFor many days after the result of the election was known,\nMr. Lincoln was burdened with congratulations; and yet,\namid these disturbances, and the cares of o\ufb00ice, which\nwere onerous in the extreme, he found time to write the\nfollowing letter:\n\u201cExecutive Mansion, Washington, Nov. , .\n\u201cDear Madam: \u2014 I have been shown, in the \ufb01les of the\nWar Department, a statement of the Adjutant-general of\nMassachusetts, that you are the mother of \ufb01ve sons, who\nhave died gloriously on the \ufb01eld of battle. I feel how weak\nand fruitless must be any words of mine which should\nattempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so\noverwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering to you\nthe consolation that may be found in the thanks of the\n republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father\nmay assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave\nyou only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and\nthe solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a\nsacri\ufb01ce upon the altar of freedom.\n\u201cYours very sincerely and respectfully,\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln.\n\u201cTo Mrs. Bixby, Boston, Massachusetts.\u201d\nFrom the day of the election to the close of the rebellion,\nthe discordant political elements of the northern states\nsubsided into silence and inaction. The election itself was\nattended with great dignity \u2014 almost, indeed, with\nsolemnity. Men felt that they were deciding something\nmore than a party question, and acted with reference to\ntheir responsibilities to God and their country. The masses\nof the democratic party were more than satis\ufb01ed with the\nresult; and such of their leaders as were thoroughly loyal\nundoubtedly felt that a victory to them, under all the\ncircumstances, would have been, in many respects, a\nmisfortune. Among the subjects of national thanksgiving on\nthe last Thursday in November \u2014 the day of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\nappointment \u2014 certainly the result of the election was not\nleast to be considered, or last to be remembered with\ndevout gratitude.\n"
