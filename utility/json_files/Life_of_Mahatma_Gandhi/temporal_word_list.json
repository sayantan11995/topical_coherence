    "1888-1892": " CHAPTER III \n\n\n\u2018M. K. GANDHI, ATTORNEY-AT-LAW  \n\nG andhi had himself photographed shortly after he arrived \nin London in . His hair is thick, black and carefully \ncombed with the parting slightly to the right of centre. \nThe ear is large. The nose is big and pointed. The eyes and lips \nare the impressive features. The eyes seem to mirror puzzlement, \nfright, yearning; they seem to be moving and looking for some\u00ac \nthing.- The lips are full, sensuous, sensitive, sad and defensive. \nThe face is that of a person who fears coming struggles with \nhimself and the world. Will he conquer his passions, he wonders; \ncan he make good? He has either been injured or is afraid of \ninjury. \n\nIn an out-of-doors group picture of the  Vegetarians\u2019 \nConference at Portsmouth, Gandhi was wearing a white tie, hard \nwhite cuffs and a white dress handkerchief in his front pocket. \nHis hair is neatly dressed. He used to spend ten minutes every \nmorning combing and brushing it. \n\nDr. Sachchidananda Sinha, an Indian then a student in Lon\u00ac \ndon, recalls meeting Gandhi in February , in Piccadilly \nCircus; Gandhi, he says, \u2018was wearing at the time a high silk top \nhat \u201cburnished bright\u201d, a stiff and starched collar (known as a \nGladstonian), a rather flashy tie displaying all the colours of the \nrainbow, under which there was a fine striped silk shirt. He wore \nas his outer clothes a morning coat, a double-breasted waistcoat, \nand dark striped trousers to match, and not only patent-leather \nshoes but spats over them. He also carried leather gloves and a \nsilver-mounted stick, but wore no spectacles. His clothes were \nregarded as the very acme of fashion for young men about town \nat that time, and were largely in vogue among the Indian youth \nprosecuting their studies in law at one of the four institutions \ncalled the Inns of Court\u2019. There were four Inns of Court: Lincoln\u2019s \nInn, Gray\u2019s Inn, the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple, and \nthe last, where Gandhi had enrolled, was, says Dr. Sinha, con\u00ac \nsidered by Indians \u2018the most aristocratic\u2019. \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\nGandhi says his \u2018punctiliousness in dress persisted for years*. \nHis top hat, he writes, was expensive, and he spent ten pounds \nfor an evening dress suit tailored to order in Bond Street. He \nasked his brother to send him a double watch chain of gold. He \nabandoned his ready-made cravat and learned to tie one himself. \nFurther \u2018aping the English gentleman*, he invested three pounds \nin a course of dancing lessons. But \u2018I could not follow the piano\u2019 \nor \u2018achieve anything like rhythmic motion*. Adamant and logical, \nhe thought he would develop an ear for music by mastering the \nviolin. He purchased an instrument and found a teacher. But \nhe gave up the effort and sold the violin. He acquired Bell\u2019s \nStandard Elocutionist and took elocution lessons. Very soon he \nabandoned that too. \n\nPlaying the gentleman would, Gandhi mistakenly thought, \nbring him into key with the dominant note in British life. He \nalways needed harmony, and the need helped him to develop \ndelicate antennae of leadership. \n\nThroughout life, Gandhi concentrated on man\u2019s day-to-day \nbehaviour. In London, his central concern was the day-to-day \nbehaviour of M. K. Gandhi. His autobiographical reminiscences \nof London student days deal entirely with his food, clothes, shy\u00ac \nness, relations with acquaintances and his religious attitude. \n\nGeorge Santayana, the American philosopher of Spanish \ndescent, visited London as a young man when Gandhi was there. \nDecades later, in The Middle Span , the second volume of his \nmemoirs, he described the visit and commented on the quality \nof the theatre, the character of Englishmen and the appearance \nof London houses, parks and streets; there are references to litera\u00ac \nture and philosophy. Santayana, the artist, attempts to recon\u00ac \nstruct a life and an era. Gandhi, the reformer, omits the cultural \nand historical background and dissects himself for the instruction \nof others. \n\nExperiences are the interaction between self and the objective \nworld. But Gandhi\u2019s autobiography is called Experiments in Truth ; \nan experiment in this sense is induced by the objective world, but \nit is essentially an operation within and upon oneself. To the end \nof his days, Gandhi attempted to master and remake himself. \n\nGandhi always focused attention on the personal. English \nfriends tried to persuade Gandhi to eat meat. One of them read \n\n \n\n\n\u2018M. K. GANDHI, ATTORNEY-AT-LAW\u2019 \n\nto him from Bentham\u2019s Theory of Utility. \u2018These abstruse things \nare beyond me,\u2019 Gandhi pleaded; he would not break the vow \nhe had given his mother. \n\nGandhi\u2019s \u2018capacious stomach\u2019 demanded filling, but the family \nwith whom he lived served no more than two or three slices of \nbread at each meal. Later the two daughters of the household gave \nhim a few extra slices; he could have done with a loaf. \u2018I practi\u00ac \ncally had to starve.\u2019 He found a vegetarian eating house in \nFarringdon Street, near Fleet Street, not far from the Inner \nTemple. He invested a shilling in Henry Salt\u2019s A Plea for Vege\u00ac \ntarianism which was being sold at the entrance. Inside, he ate \nhis first hearty meal in England: \u2018God had come to my aid.\u2019 \n\nThe Salt treatise made him a vegetarian by choice. In the be\u00ac \nginning was the act, and only then the conviction. \n\nFrugal eating led to frugal spending. Even during the brief \nspree of \u2018aping the gentleman\u2019, Gandhi kept minutely accurate \naccounts of all outlays for food, clothing, postage, bus fares, \nnewspapers, books, etc. Before going to bed each night he \nbalanced his finances. Now, after an experiment in boarding \nwith a family, he found lodgings about half an hour\u2019s walk from \nschool. He thus saved on fares as well as rent and, to boot, got \nsome exercise. He walked eight to ten miles a day. \n\nThe example of poor Indian students in London and the guilty \nsense of being prodigal with his brother\u2019s money impelled Gandhi \nto economize still further. He abandoned his suite and moved \nto one room. He cooked his own breakfast of oatmeal porridge \nand cocoa. For lunch he went to his favourite vegetarian \nrestaurant; dinner consisted of bread and cocoa prepared at \nhome. Food cost him one and threepence a day. \n\nAll the while sweets and spices had been coming to him by sea \nfrom India. He discontinued this luxury. He began to eat, and \nenjoy, boiled spinach with no condiments. \u2018Many such experi\u00ac \nments\u2019, he remarked, \u2018taught me that the real seat of taste was \nnot the tongue but the mind,\u2019 and Gandhi had commenced that \nremarkable lifelong task of changing his mind. \n\nUnder the influence of food reformers Gandhi varied his menu, \ngiving up starches for a period, or living on bread and fruit, and \nagain on cheese, milk and eggs for weeks at a time. He had \nbecome a member of the executive committee of the Vegetarian \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nSociety of England. An expert convinced him that eggs were not \nmeat; the consumption of eggs injured no living creatures. After \na while, however, Gandhi thought better of it. His mother, he \nreasoned, regarded eggs as meat, and since she had received his \nvow, her definition was binding. He gave up eggs; he gave up \ndishes, cakes and puddings made with eggs, even when they were \nserved at the vegetarian restaurant. This was an additional priva\u00ac \ntion, but satisfaction in observing the vow produced \u2018an inward \nrelish distinctly more healthy, delicate and permanent\u2019 than food. \n\nGandhi had reduced his weekly budget to fifteen shillings. He \nlearned to prepare English dishes. Carrot soup was a speciality. \nSometimes he invited Narayan Hemchandra to partake of a meal \nin his room. Narayan was a young Indian who had just arrived \nfrom home after having earned a reputation as a writer. \u2018His \ndress was queer,\u2019 Gandhi reports. \n\nGandhi\u2019s English was still far from perfect but Narayan\u2019s was \nworse, and Mohandas began giving him lessons. Once Narayan \narrived at Gandhi\u2019s home clothed in a shirt and a loincloth. \nWhen the landlady opened the door she ran back in fright to tell \nGandhi that \u2018a madcap\u2019 wanted to see him. \u2018I was shocked\u2019 at \nNarayan\u2019s clothes, Gandhi wrote. \n\nNarayan planned to learn French and visit France, to learn \nGerman and visit Germany, and to travel to America. He did \ngo to France and translated French books. Gandhi revised several \nof the translations. Narayan also visited America, where he was \narrested for indecent exposure. \n\nStirred by Narayan Hemchandra, Gandhi crossed the Channel \nin  to see the great Paris Exhibition. \u2018I had heard of a \nvegetarian restaurant in Paris-. So I engaged a room there and \nstayed seven days,\u2019 Gandhi recalls. \u2018I managed everything very \neconomically ... I remember nothing of the Exhibition except its \nmagnitude and variety. I have a fair recollection of the Eiffel \nTower as I ascended it twice or thrice. There was a restaurant \non the first platform, and just for the satisfaction of being able to \nsay that I had my lunch at a great height, I threw away seven \nshillings on it.\u2019 \n\nCount Leo Tolstoy had called the Eiffel Tower a monument to \nman\u2019s folly. Gandhi read this disparaging remark and concurred. \n\u2018The Tower\u2019, Gandhi felt, \u2018was a good demonstration of the fact \n\n \n\n\n\u2018 M. K. GANDHI, ATTORNEY-AT-LAW' \n\nthat we are all children attracted by trinkets\u2019; neither beauty nor \nart recommended it, only its size and novelty. However, Gandhi \ndid enjoy the grandeur and peace of the ancient churches of Paris, \nnotably Notre-Dame with its elaborate interior decorations and \nsculptures. After the noisy, frivolous streets and boulevards, \nGandhi found dignity and reverence in the houses of God. French \npeople kneeling before a statue of the Virgin were \u2018not wor\u00ac \nshipping mere marble\u2019 but rather \u2018the divinity of which it is \nsymbolic\u2019. \n\nGandhi made no comment on British churches. In England, \nhe played bridge, wore his \u2018visiting suit\u2019 on occasions and evening \ndress for festivitiesj and took an active organizational part in \nseveral vegetarian societies. But he could not make the most \ninformal remarks, and had to write out his views and ask others \nto read them. \u2018Even when I paid a social call the presence of- \nhalf a dozen or more people would strike me dumb.\u2019 \n\nThe purpose for which Gandhi came to England receives only \na few lines in his reminiscences, far fewer than his dietetic adven\u00ac \ntures. He was admitted as a student at the Inner Temple on \nNovember th, , and matriculated at London University, in \nJune . He learned French and Latin, physics and Common \nand Roman law. He read Roman law in Latin and bought many \nbooks. He improved his English. He had no difficulty in passing \nthe final examinations. Called to the bar on June iotli, , he \nenrolled in the High Court on June nth, and sailed for India on \nJune th. He had no wish to spend a single extra day in England. \n\nGandhi does not seem to have been happy in England. It was \na necessary interim period: he had to be there to get professional \nstatus. His chief English contacts were a group of aged, crusading \nvegetarians \u2018who\u2019, he later declared, \u2018had the habit of talking of \nnothing but food and nothing but disease\u2019. He neither received \nnor gave warmth. \n\nGandhi did not yet feel at home in English. Later, as a \nMahatma, he constantly stressed the importance of studying and \nspeaking in one\u2019s native tongue; otherwise one lost much mental \neffort bridging the gulf of language. British life was very foreign \nto him. \n\nAt first, Gandhi had thought he could become an \u2018Englishman\u2019. \nHence the fervour with which he seized the instruments of con- \n\n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nversion: clothes, dancing, elocution lessons, etc. Then he realized \nhow high the barrier was. He understood he would remain \nIndian. Therefore he became more Indian. \n\nGandhi\u2019s two years and eight months in England came at a \nformative phase of his life and must have shaped his personality. \nBut their influence was probably less than normal. For Gandhi \nwas not the student type; he did not learn essential things by \nstudying. He was the doer, and he grew and gained knowledge \nthrough action. Books, people and conditions affected him. But \nthe real Gandhi, the Gandhi of history, did not emerge, did not \neven hint of his existence in the years of schooling and study. \nPerhaps it is unfair to expect too much of the frail provincial \nIndian transplanted to metropolitan London at the green age of \neighteen. Yet the contrast between the mediocre, unimpressive, \nhandicapped, floundering M. K. Gandhi, barrister-at-law, who \nleft England in , and the Mahatma leader of millions is so \ngreat as to suggest that until public service tapped his enormous \nreserves of intuition, will powder, energy and self-confidence, his \ntrue personality lay dormant. To be sure, he fed it unconsciously; \nhis loyalty to the vow of no meat, no wine, no women, was a \nyouthful exercise in wall and devotion which later flowered into \na way of life. But only wdien it was touched by the magic wand of \naction in .South Africa did the personality of Gandhi burgeon. \nIn Young India of September th, , he said his college days \nwere before the time \u2018when ... I began life\u2019. \n\nGandhi advanced to greatness by doing. The Gita, Hinduism\u2019s \nholy scripture, therefore became Gandhi\u2019s gospel, for it glorifies \naction. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER V \n\n\nINDIAN INTERLUDE \n\nI n London, Gandhi never got beyond Leviticus and Numbers; \nthe first books of the Old Testament bored him. Later in life \nhe enjoyed the Prophets, Psalms and Ecclesiastes. The New \nTestament was more interesting, and the Sermon on the Mount \n\u2018went straight to my heart\u2019. He saw similarities between it and the \nGita. \n\n\u2018But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall \nsmite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if \nany man take away thy coat let him have thy cloak too.\u2019 These \nwords of Christ \u2018delighted\u2019 Gandhi. Other verses struck a sym\u00ac \npathetic chord in the Mahatma-to-be: \u2018Blessed are the meek . . . \nBlessed are ye, when men shall revile you and persecute you . . . \nwhosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in \ndanger of the judgment. . . Agree with thine adversary quickly . . . \nwhosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed \nadultery already in his heart . . . Love your enemies, bless them \nthat curse you . . . forgive men their trespasses . . . Lay not up \nfor yourselves treasures upon earth ... For where your treasure \nis, there will your heart be also. . . .\u2019 \n\nIt was thanks to a Bible salesman in England that Gandhi read \nthe Old and New Testaments. At the suggestion of a friend, he \nread Thomas Carlyle\u2019s essay on the prophet Mohammed. Having \nmet Madame H. P. Blavatsky and Mrs. Annie Besant in London, \nhe studied their books on theosophy. Gandhi\u2019s religious reading \nwas accidental and desultory. Nevertheless, it apparently met a \nneed, for he was not a great reader and, apart from law tomes, \nhad not read much, not even a history of India. \n\nGandhi refused to join Britain\u2019s new theosophist movement, but \nhe rejoiced in Mrs. Besant\u2019s renunciation of godlessness. He him\u00ac \nself had already traversed \u2018the Sahara of atheism\u2019 and emerged \nfrom it thirsty for religion. \n\nIn this state he returned to India in the summer of . He \nwas more worldly but no more articulate. He quickly recognized \nd m.g.  \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nhis failures yet stubbornly insisted on having his way. He was \nself-critical and self-confident, temperamentally shy and intel\u00ac \nlectually sure. \n\nOn landing at Bombay, his brother told him that Putlibai, their \nmother, was dead. The news had been kept from Mohandas \nbecause the family knew his devotion to her. He was shocked, \nbut his grief, greater than when his father died, remained under \ncontrol. \n\nGandhi\u2019s son Harilal was four; his brothers had several older \nchildren, boys and girls. The returned barrister led them in \nphysical exercises and walks, and played and joked with them. \nHe also had time for quarrels with his wife; once, in fact, he sent \nher away from Rajkot to her parents\u2019 home in Porbandar; he \nwas still jealous. He performed all the duties of a husband \nexcept support his wife and child; he had no money. \n\nLaxmidas Gandhi, a lawyer in Rajkot, had built high hopes \non his younger brother. But Mohandas was a complete failure \nas a lawyer in Rajkot as well as in Bombay where he could not \nutter a word during a petty case in court. \n\nLaxmidas, who had financed Gandhi\u2019s studies in England, was \neven more disappointed at his brother\u2019s failure to carry out a \ndelicate mission for him. Laxmidas had been the secretary and \nadviser of the heir to the throne of Porbandar. He was thus \ndestined, it seemed, to follow in his father\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s \nfootsteps and become prime minister of the little state. But he \nlost favour with the British Political Agent. Now Mohandas had \ncasually met the agent in London. Laxmidas therefore wanted \nhis brother to see the Englishman and adjust matters. Gandhi \ndid not think it right to presume on a slight acquaintance and \nask an interview for such a purpose. But he yielded to his brother\u2019s \nimportuning. The agent was cold: Laxmidas could apply through \nthe proper channels if he thought he had been wronged. Gandhi \npersisted. The agent showed him the door; Gandhi stayed to \nargue; the agent\u2019s clerk or messenger took hold of Gandhi and \nput him out. \n\nThe shock of the encounter with the British agent, Gandhi \ndeclares in his autobiography, \u2018changed the course of my entire \nlife\u2019. He had been doing odd legal jobs for the ruling prince. He \nand his brother hoped he would finally obtain a position as judge \n\n \n\n\nINDIAN INTERLUDE \n\n\nor minister in the government which might lead to further ad\u00ac \nvancement in the tradition of the family. But his altercation with \nthe agent upset these plans. Only a sycophant could succeed and \nget on. The episode intensified his dislike of the atmosphere \nof petty intrigue, palace pomp and snobbery which prevailed in \nPorbandar, Rajkot and the other miniature principalities of the \nKathiawar peninsula. It was poison to character. Gandhi yearned \nto escape from it. \n\nAt this juncture a business firm of Porbandar Moslems offered \nto send him to South Africa for a year as their lawyer. He seized \nthe opportunity to see a new country and get new experiences; \nT wanted somehow to leave India.\u2019 So, after less than two un\u00ac \nsuccessful years in his native land, its future leader boarded a ship \nfor Zanzibar, Mozambique and Natal. He left behind him his \nwife and two children; on October th, , a second son \nnamed Manilal had been born. \u2018By way of consolation\u2019, \nGandhi assured Kasturbai that \u2018we are bound to meet again in \na year\u2019. \n\nIn Bombay, Gandhi had met Raychandbai. \u2018No one else, \nGandhi said, \u2018has ever made on me the impression that Raychand\u00ac \nbai did.\u2019 Raychandbai was a jeweller-poet with a phenomenal \nmemory. He was rich, a connoisseur of diamonds and pearls, and \na good business man. Gandhi was impressed by his religious \nlearning, his upright character and his passion for self-realization. \nRaychandbai\u2019s deeds, Gandhi felt, were guided by his desire for \ntruth and godliness. Gandhi trusted him completely. In a crisis, \nGandhi ran to Raychandbai for confession and comfort. From \nSouth Africa, Gandhi sought and obtained Raychandbai\u2019s advice. \nNevertheless, Gandhi did not accept Raychandbai as his guru. \nHindus believe that every man should acknowledge a guru, a \nsuperior person, near or far, living or dead, as one\u2019s teacher, \nguide, or mentor. But Raychandbai lacked the perfection that \nGandhi sought in a guru. Gandhi never did find a guru; \u2018The \nthrone has remained vacant,\u2019 he said. For a Hindu, this is tre\u00ac \nmendously significant and for Gandhi it is endlessly revealing. \nIn the presence of prominent men he felt respect, humility and \nawe, but, wrapped in these sentiments, he sometimes became \nimpervious to their thoughts. With all his diffidence he was \nspiritually independent. Ideas came to him occasionally through \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\nbooks but chiefly through his own acts. He remade himself by \ntapping his own inner resources. \n\nGandhi was a self-remade man and the transformation began \nin South Africa. It is not that he turned failure into success. \nUsing the clay that was there he turned himself into another \nperson. His was a remarkable case of second birth in one lifetime. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n",
    "1893-1897": " CHAPTER VI \n\n\nTOWARDS GREATNESS \n\nW hen Gandhi landed at Durban, Natal, in May , his \nmission was simply to win a lawsuit, earn some money and \nperhaps, at long last, start his career: \u2018Try my luck in \nSouth Africa/ he said. As he left the boat to meet his employer, \na Moslem business man named Dada Abdulla Sheth, Gandhi wore a \nfashionable frock coat, pressed trousers, shining shoes and a \nturban. \n\nSouth African society was sharply divided by colour, class, \nreligion and profession, and each group jealously defended the \nwords and symbols which demarcated it from the others. English\u00ac \nmen called all Indians \u2018coolies\u2019 or \u2018samis\u2019, and they referred to \n\u2018coolie teachers\u2019, \u2018coolie merchants\u2019, \u2018coolie barristers\u2019, etc., for\u00ac \ngetting, deliberately, that if coolie meant anything it meant \nmanual labourer. To rise above the coolie level, Parsis from \nIndia styled themselves Persians, and Moslems from India chose \nto be regarded as \u2018Arabs\u2019 which they were not. A turban was \nofficially recognized as part of the costume of an \u2018Arab\u2019 but not \nof a Hindu. \n\nSeveral days after arriving, Gandhi went to court. The \nmagistrate ordered him to remove his turban. Gandhi demurred \nand left the court. To obviate further trouble, he decided to \nwear an English hat. No, said Dada Abdulla Sheth, a hat on a \ncoloured man is the symbol of a waiter. \n\nThe lawsuit required Gandhi\u2019s presence in Pretoria, the capital \nof Transvaal. First class accommodations were purchased for him \nat Durban where he boarded the train for the overnight journey. \nAt Maritzburg, the capital of Natal, a white man entered the \ncompartment, eyed the brown intruder, and withdrew to reappear \nin a few moments with two railway officials who told Gandhi \nto transfer to third class. Gandhi protested that he held a first \nclass ticket. That didn\u2019t matter; he had to leave. He stayed. So \nthey fetched a policeman who took him off with his luggage. \nGandhi could have returned to the train and found a place in \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\nthe third class car. But he chose to remain in the station waiting \nroom. It was cold in the mountains. His overcoat was in his \nluggage which the railway people were holding; afraid to be \ninsulted again, he did not ask for it. All night long, he sat and \nshivered, and brooded. \n\nShould he return to India? This episode reflected a much larger \nsituation. Should he address himself to it or merely seek redress \nof his personal grievance, finish the case, and go home to India? \nHe had encountered the dread disease of colour prejudice. It \nwas his duty to combat it. To flee, leaving his countrymen in \ntheir predicament, would be cowardice. The frail lawyer began \nto see himself in the role of a David assailing the Goliath of racial \ndiscrimination. \n\nMany years later, in India, Dr. John R. Mott, a Christian \nmissionary, asked Gandhi, c What have been the most creative \nexperiences in your life?\u2019 In reply, Gandhi told the story of the \nnight in the Maritzburg station. \n\nWhy, of all people, did it occur to Gandhi to resist the evil? \nThe next morning Indians he met recounted similar experiences. \nThey made the best of conditions; \u2018You cannot strike your head \nagainst a stone wall.\u2019 But Gandhi intended to test its hardness. \nHis father and grandfather had defied authority. His own meagre \ncontacts with it in India were unhappy. He had rejected the \nauthoritative, time-and-tradition-honoured version of the Bhaga- \nvad Gita for his own. Was it this inherent anti-authoritarianism \nthat made him rebel against the government colour line? Was he \nmore sensitive, resentful, unfettered and ambitious because his \nlife, so far, had been a failure? Did he aspire to be strong morally \nbecause he was weak physically? Did challenging immoral prac\u00ac \ntices in an uncrowded arena present greater opportunities for \nservice than the pursuit of personal gain in crowded courts? Was \nit destiny, heritage, luck, the Gita , or some other immeasurable \nquantity? \n\nThat bitter night at Maritzburg the germ of social protest was \nborn in Gandhi. But he did nothing. He proceeded on his busi\u00ac \nness to Pretoria. \n\nThe Charlesto\\vn-to-Johannesburg lap was negotiated by stage \ncoach. There were three seats on the cqach box, usually occupied \nby the driver and the \u2018leader\u2019 of the. trip. On this occasion, the \n\n \n\n\nTOWARDS G R E A T N E S S \n\n\n\u2018leader\u2019 sat inside and told Gandhi to ride with the driver and a \nHottentot. There was space for Gandhi inside, but he did not \nwant to make a fuss and miss the coach, so he mounted to the \ndriver\u2019s perch. Later, however, the deader\u2019 decided he wanted \nto smoke and get some air; he spread a piece of dirty sacking at \nthe driver\u2019s feet on the footboard and instructed Gandhi to sit \non it. Gandhi complained; why could he not go inside? At this, \nthe deader\u2019 began to curse and tried to drag him off the coach. \nGandhi clung to the brass rail though he felt that his wrists would \nbreak. But he did not relax his hold. The deader\u2019 continued \nalternately to pummel and pull him until the white passengers \nintervened: \u2018Don\u2019t beat him,\u2019 they shouted. \u2018He is not to blame. \nHe is right.\u2019 The deader\u2019, yielding to the customers, relented, and \nGandhi entered the coach. \n\nThe next day, Gandhi wrote to the coach company and received \na written assurance that he would not be molested again. \n\nIn Johannesburg, Gandhi went to an hotel, but failed to get a \nroom. Indians laughed at his naivety. \u2018This country is not for \nmen like you,\u2019 a rich Indian merchant said to him. \u2018For making \nmoney we do not mind pocketing insults, and here we are.\u2019 The \nsame person advised Gandhi to travel third class to Pretoria \nbecause conditions in the Transvaal were much worse than in \nNatal. But Gandhi was obdurate. He ordered the railway regu\u00ac \nlations to be brought to him, read them, and found that the prohi\u00ac \nbition was not precise. He therefore penned a note to the station \nmaster stating that he was a barrister and always travelled first (it \nwas his ninth day and first journey in South Africa) and would \nsoon apply in person for a ticket. \n\nThe station master proved sympathetic. He sold Gandhi the \nticket on condition that he would not sue the company if the \nguards or the passengers ejected him. The collector came to \nexamine the tickets and held up three fingers. Gandhi vehemently \nrefused to move to third class. The sole other passenger, an \nEnglishman, scolded the guard and invited Gandhi to make \nhimself comfortable. \n\n\u2018If you want to travel with a coolie, what do I care,\u2019 the guard \ngrumbled. \n\nAt the station in Pretoria, Gandhi asked a railway official about \nhotels, but got no helpful information. An American Negro, who \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\noverheard the conversation, offered to take Gandhi to an inn \nrun by an American: Johnston\u2019s Family Hotel. Mr. Johnston \ncheerfully accommodated him but suggested, with apologies, that \nsince all the other guests were white, he take dinner in his room. \n\nWaiting for his food, Gandhi pondered the adventures he had \nhad on this strange trip. Not everybody was prejudiced; some \nwhites felt uncomfortable about it all. Presently Mr. Johnston \nknocked and said, \u2018I was ashamed of having asked you to take \nyour dinner here, so I spoke to the other guests about you, and \nasked them if they would mind your having dinner in the dining\u00ac \nroom. They said they had no objection, and they did not mind \nyour staying here as long as you liked.\u2019 Gandhi enjoyed the meal \ndownstairs. But lodgings in a private home were cheaper than \nMr. Johnston\u2019s hotel. \n\nWithin a week of his arrival Gandhi summoned all the Indians \nin Pretoria to a meeting. He wanted \u2018to present to them a picture \nof their condition\u2019. He was twenty-four. This was his first public \nspeech. The audience consisted of Moslem merchants interspersed \nwith a few Hindus. He urged four things: Tell the truth even in \nbusiness; Adopt more sanitary habits; Forget caste and religious \ndivisions; Learn English. A barber, a clerk and a shopkeeper \naccepted his offer of English lessons. The barber merely wished \nto acquire the vocabulary of his trade. Gandhi dogged them for \nmonths and would not let them be lazy or lax in their studies. \n\nOther meetings followed, and soon Gandhi knew every Indian \nin Pretoria. He communicated with the railway authorities and \nelicited the promise that \u2018properly dressed\u2019 Indians might travel \nfirst or second class. Though open to arbitrary interpretation, \nthis represented progress. Gandhi was encouraged. The Pretorian \nIndians formed a permanent organization. \n\nThe lawsuit for which Gandhi came to South Africa brought \nhim into contact with Roman Catholics, Protestants, Quakers \nand Plymouth Brethren. Some of them tried to convert him to \nChristianity. Gandhi did not discourage their efforts. He pro\u00ac \nmised that if the inner voice commanded it he would embrace \nthe Christian faith. He read the books they gave him and tried \nto answer their searching questions about Indian religions. When \nhe did not know the answers he wrote to friends in England and \nto Raychandbai, the jeweller-poet of Bombay. \n\n \n\n\nTOWARDS GREATNESS \n\n\nOnce Michael Coates, a Quaker, urged Gandhi to discard the \nbeads which, as a member of the Hindu Vaishnava sect, he always \nwore around his neck. \n\n\u2018This superstition does not become you,\u2019 Coates exclaimed. \n\u2018Come, let me break the necklace.\u2019 \n\n\u2018No, you will not,\u2019 Gandhi protested. \u2018It is a sacred gift from \nmy mother.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But do you believe in it?\u2019 Coates questioned. \n\n\u2018I do not know its mysterious significance,\u2019 Gandhi said, de\u00ac \nfensively. \u2018T do not think I should come to harm if I did not \nwear it. But I cannot, without sufficient reason, give up a necklace \nwhich she put round my neck out of love and in the conviction \nthat it would be conducive to my welfare. When, with the passage \nof time, it wears away, and breaks of its own accord, I shall have \nno reason to get a new one. But this necklace cannot be broken.\u2019 \nLater in life he did not wear beads. \n\nGandhi\u2019s Christian friends taught him the essence of Chris\u00ac \ntianity. They said if he believed in Jesus he would find redemption. \n\u2018I do not seek redemption from the consequences of sin,\u2019 Gandhi \nreplied. \u2018I seek to be redeemed from sin itself.\u2019 They said that \nwas impossible. Nor could Gandhi understand why, if God had \none son, He could not have another. Why could he go to Heaven \nand attain salvation only as a Christian? Did Christianity have a \nmonopoly of Heaven? Was God a Christian? Did He have \nprejudices against non-Christians? \n\nGandhi liked the sweet Christian hymns and many of the \nChristians he met. But he could not regard Christianity as the \nperfect religion or the greatest religion. \u2018From the point of view \nof sacrifice, it seemed to me that the Hindus greatly surpassed the \nChristians.\u2019 And Raychandbai assured him that Hinduism was \nunexcelled in subtlety and profundity. On the other hand, \nGandhi doubted whether the sacred Hindu Vedas were the only \ninspired word of God. \u2018Why not also the Bible and the Koran ?\u2019 \nHe recoiled from the competitiveness of religions. \n\nHe also disliked the competitiveness of lawyers. His client, \nDada Abdulla Sheth, and the opposing party, Tyeb Sheth, were \nrelatives, and the cost of the litigation, dragging out for more than \na year, was ruining both. Gandhi suggested a compromise out \nof court. Finally, the plaintiff and defendant agreed on an \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\narbitrator who heard the case and decided in favour of Dada \nAbdulla. Now a new problem confronted Gandhi. Tyeb was \ncalled upon to pay thirty-seven thousand pounds and costs. This \nthreatened him with bankruptcy. Gandhi induced Dada Abdulla \nto permit the loser to pay in instalments stretched over a very \nextended period. \n\nIn preparing the case, Gandhi learned the secrets of bookkeep\u00ac \ning and some of the fine points of law. Above all, it reinforced his \nopinion that settlements out of court were preferable to trials. He \nfollowed this practice during his twenty years as a lawyer: T lost \nnothing thereby \u2014 not even money, certainly not my soul.\u2019 \n\nThe lawsuit settled, Gandhi returned to Durban and prepared \nto sail for India. He had been in South Africa almost twelve \nmonths. Before his departure, his associates gave him a farewell \nparty. During the festivities someone handed him the day\u2019s Natal \nMercury , and in it he found a brief item regarding the Natal govern\u00ac \nment\u2019s proposed bill to deprive Indians of their right to elect \nmembers of the legislature. Gandhi stressed the necessity of \nresisting this move. His friends were ready but they were \u2018un\u00ac \nlettered, lame\u2019 men, they said, and powerless without him. He \nconsented to stay a month. He remained twenty years fighting \nthe battle for Indian rights. He won. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER VII \n\n\nA MOB SCENE \n\nNatal, in , had , Negro inhabitants, , \nwhites, and , Indians. The Cape of Good Hope \nColony had , Negroes, , Europeans and , \nIndians; the Transvaal Republic, , Negroes, , \nwhites and about  Indians. Similar proportions obtained in \nother areas. In , the five million Negroes easily outnumbered \na million and a quarter whites. \n\nIndians or no Indians, the whites were a permanent minority \nin South Africa. But the Indians were thrifty, able and ambitious, \nand they worked hard. Given normal opportunities, they became \nrivals of the whites in business, agriculture, law and the other \nprofessions. \n\nIs that why the Indians were persecuted? \n\nThe Dutch, who first settled South Africa in the sixteenth cen\u00ac \ntury, brought their slaves from Malaya, Java and other Pacific \nislands; they concentrated in Transvaal and the Orange Free \nState. The British arrived much later. In Natal, they found they \ncould grow sugar cane, tea and coffee. But the Negroes were \nreluctant to work for them. Arrangements were accordingly \nmade for the shipment of indentured labourers from India. \u2018The \nIndian had come to South Africa  , wrote Chancellor Jan H. \nHofmeyer of the Witwaterstrand University in Johannesburg, \n\u2018because it was deemed to be in the white man\u2019s interest that he \nshould. It seemed to be impossible to exploit the Natal coastal \nbelt without indentured labour. So the Indians came \u2014 and \nbrought prosperity to Natal.  \n\nThe first Indian contract workers landed in Natal on November \nth, i. That was the genesis of the Gandhi saga in South \nAfrica. \n\nThe indentured Indians were term serfs. They came from India \nvoluntarily or, frequently, involuntarily and not knowing where \nthey were going; many were untouchables snatched from semi\u00ac \nstarvation. The system tied them for five years to private farms. \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nThey were given free board and lodging for themselves and their \nfamilies and ten shillings a month in the first year and an addi\u00ac \ntional shilling a month each year after. At the end of five years \nthe contractor paid their passage back to India. He did likewise \nif they remained an additional five years as free labourers. \nIn numerous cases, the indentured labourers chose to become \npermanent residents. \n\nWhen Gandhi had been in South Africa just over twelve months \n\u2014 on August th,  \u2014 these conditions were altered. At the \nend of the first five-year period, the indentured labourer was \nobliged to return to India or agree to be a serf in South Africa for \never. But if he wished to stay as a free working man, he had to \npay an annual tax of three pounds for himself and for each of his \ndependants. Three pounds was the equivalent of six months  pay \nof an indentured labourer. \n\nThis aroused a storm at the centre of which stood Gandhi. \n\nIndentured Indian immigration drew after it thousands of free \nIndians who came as hawkers, tradesmen, artisans and mem\u00ac \nbers of the professions, like Gandhi. They numbered perhaps fifty \nthousand in . The pedlars carried their wares on their backs \nhundreds of miles into Zulu villages where no white man would \ntry to do business. Gradually, many of them acquired riches and \nproperty. Indians even owned steamship lines. \n\nIn ,  free Indians in Natal, being subjects of Her British \nMajesty, Queen Victoria, and having met the wealth qualification, \nenjoyed the right to vote. But that year the Natal legislature passed \na law explicitly disfranchising Asiatics. \n\nThis was the second serious Indian complaint. \n\nThroughout Natal, an Indian had to carry a pass to be in the \nstreets after  p.m. Persons without passes were arrested. The \nOrange Free State, a Boer republic, forbade Indians to own \nproperty, to trade, or to farm. In the Crown Colony of Zululand, \nIndians were not allowed to own or buy land. The same pro\u00ac \nscription applied in the Transvaal where, moreover, Indians had \nto pay a three-pound fee for the right to reside; but residence was \nrestricted to slums. In the Cape Colony, some municipalities \nprohibited Indians from walking on footpaths. Elsewhere, \nIndians avoided footpaths and pavements because they might be \nkicked off, Gandhi himself was once so kicked. Indians in South \n\n \n\n\nA MOB SCENE \n\n\nAfrica were legally barred from buying South African gold. They \nwere described in statute books as \u2018semi-barbarous Asiatics\u2019. \n\nIn three years in South Africa, Gandhi had become a prosperous \nlawyer and the outstanding Indian political figure. He was \nwidely known as the champion of indentured labourers. He \naddressed conferences, drafted memorials to government ministers, \nwrote letters to newspapers, circulated petitions (one was signed \nby ten thousand Indians), and made many friends among whites, \nIndians and Negroes. He learned a few Zulu words and found the \nlanguage \u2018very sweet\u2019. He also achieved some knowledge of \nTamil, a Dravidian tongue spoken by natives of Madras and other \nsouth-Indian provinces. When work permitted he read books, \nchiefly on religion. He published two pamphlets: An Appeal to \nEvery Briton in South Africa and The Indian Franchise , an Appeal. \n\n\u2018Appeal\u2019 was the key to Gandhi\u2019s politics. He appealed to the \ncommon sense and morality of his adversary. \u2018It has always been \na mystery to me\u2019, he says in his autobiography, \u2018how men can feel \nthemselves honoured by the humiliation of their fellow-beings.\u2019 \nThis was the essence of Gandhi\u2019s appeal. \n\nGandhi\u2019s struggle in South Africa did not aim to achieve equal \ntreatment for the Indians there. He recognized that the whites \nthought they needed protection against a coloured majority \nconsisting of Indians and Negroes. He also knew, as he wrote in a \nletter to the Times of India of June nd, , that \u2018prejudices \ncannot be removed by legislation . . . They will yield only to \npatient toil and education\u2019. \n\nNor were the Indians protesting against segregation. \u2018They \nfeel the ostracism but they silently bear it\u2019, Gandhi wrote. \n\nThis too was a long-range problem. \n\nGandhi\u2019s immediate quarrel with the white governments of \nNatal, Transvaal, the Orange Free State and Cape Colony was \n\u2018for feeding the prejudice by legalizing it\u2019. At least the laws must \nbe just; often they are not. \u2018I refuse to believe in the infallibility \nof legislators,\u2019 he said. \u2018I believe that they are not always guided \nby generous or even just sentiments in their dealings with un\u00ac \nrepresented classes.\u2019 They may react to non-existent perils; they \nmay serve the interests of white merchants irked by Indian \ncompetitors. \n\nGandhi wished to establish one principle: that Indians were \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\ncitizens of the British Empire and therefore entitled to equality \nunder its laws. He did not expect fair administration of the laws; \nthe whites would always be favoured. But once the principle of \nlegal equality was fixed he would be content to let life work out its \nown complicated pattern, trusting honest citizens to brighten the \ndesign. If, however, the Indians supinely acknowledged their \ninferiority they would lose dignity and deteriorate. So would the \nwhites who imposed the inferiority. \n\nGandhi aimed to save the dignity of Indians and whites. \n\nThus far in South Africa, Gandhi had displayed unflagging \nenergy, an inexhaustible capacity for indignation, an eagerness \nto serve the community, honesty which inspired trust, and a talent \nfor easy personal relations with the lowly and the prominent. \nZeal and a cause dissolved his timidity and loosened his tongue. \nThough there was only slight visible evidence, as yet, of the great \nGandhi of history, he had proved himself an effective leader and \nan excellent organizer. His Indian co-workers felt acutely, and he \ncould not fail to see, that without him the struggle for Indian \nrights would collapse or at least lag. \n\nGandhi accordingly took six months\u2019 leave and went to India \nto fetch his family. \n\nArrived in the homeland in the middle of , the twenty- \nseven-year-old man with a mission developed a furious activity. \nIn Rajkot Gandhi spent a month in the bosom of his family writing \na pamphlet on Indian grievances in South Africa. Bound in \ngreen and consequently known as \u2018The Green Pamphlet\u2019, it was \nprinted in ten thousand copies and sent to newspapers and \nprominent Indians. Many publications reviewed it. To mail the \nrest of the edition Gandhi, always eager to keep down expenses, \nmobilized the children of the neighbourhood who wrote the \naddresses, licked the wrappers and pasted the stamps when there \nwas no school. He rewarded them with used stamps and his \nblessing. The children were delighted. Two of them grew up to \nbe Gandhi\u2019s close disciples. \n\nAt this juncture, the bubonic plague appeared in Bombay and \nRajkot was in panic. Gandhi volunteered his services to the State \nand joined the official committee in charge of preventive measures. \nHe stressed the need of supervising toilets and accepted that task \nhimself. \u2018The poor people\u2019, he remarks in his memoirs, \u2018had no \n\n \n\n\nA MOB SCENE \n\n\nobjection to their latrines being inspected and, what is more, \nthey carried out the improvements suggested to them. But when \nwe went to the houses of the upper ten, some of them even refused \nus admission. It was our common experience that the latrines \nof the rich were more unclean.  Next, Gandhi urged that the \ncommittee investigate the untouchables\u2019 quarter. Only one \ncommittee member would go with him. It was Gandhi\u2019s first \nvisit to the slums. He had never known how outcasts lived. He \ndiscovered that they did not have latrines or any enclosed facilities. \nBut their houses were clean. \n\nFrom Rajkot Gandhi went to Bombay to arrange a public \nmeeting on South Africa. He introduced himself to the leading \ncitizens and enlisted their support. Meanwhile he nursed his \nsister\u2019s husband, who was ill, and later moved the dying patient \ninto his own room. Gandhi always boasted of an \u2018aptitude for \nnursing which gradually developed into a passion\u2019. \n\nThe Bombay meeting was a tremendous success because of the \nsponsors and the topic. Gandhi had a written speech but could \nnot make himself heard in the big hall. Somebody on the plat\u00ac \nform read it for him. \n\nAt Poona, inland from Bombay, Gandhi interviewed two of the \ngreat men of India: Gopal Krishna Gokhale, President of the \nServants of India Society, and Lokamanya Tilak, a giant intellect \nand towering political leader. Tilak, Gandhi said later, was like \nthe ocean and you could not readily launch yourself on it; Gokhale \nwas like the Ganges in whose refreshing, holy waters one longed to \nbathe. He fell in love with Gokhale but did not take him as his \nguru. Gandhi described a guru in Young India of October th, \n, as a rare combination of \u2018perfect purity and perfect learn\u00ac \ning\u2019. Gokhale, as Gandhi saw him, failed to meet those require\u00ac \nments. He did, however, become Gandhi\u2019s political guru, his \nideal in politics. \n\n\u2018They treat us as beasts,\u2019 Gandhi cried out at a mass meeting in \nMadras on October th, . \u2018The policy is to class us with the \nKaffir whenever possible,\u2019 he said. South Africa depressed the \nliving standards of Indians and locked them up in insanitary \ndistricts; then the whites condemned the dirty Indian habits. \n\n\u2018Submission\u2019 to these \u2018insults and indignities\u2019, Gandhi told the \nmeeting, \u2018means degradation\u2019. He urged resistance. He urged, \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\ntoo, that if no amelioration took place emigration from India to \nSouth Africa be suspended. \n\nAt the Bombay, Poona and Madras meetings, Gandhi quoted \nfrom the \u2018Green Pamphlet  and asked the audience to buy it on \nthe way out. In Madras, the proud author, noting the brochure\u2019s \nsuccess, brought out a second ten thousand edition which, at first, \n\u2018sold like hot cakes\u2019; but he had overestimated the market and was \nleft with a remainder. \n\nGandhi hoped to repeat the performance in Calcutta and \ntalked with newspaper editors and eminent citizens. But a cable \nrecalled him to Natal, South Africa, to cope with an emergency. \nHe therefore rushed back to Bombay where, with his wife, two \nsons and the widowed sister\u2019s only son, he boarded the S.S. Courland , \na ship belonging to his client, Dada Abdulla Sheth, who gave the \nwhole family a free trip. The S.S. JVaderi sailed for Natal at the \nsame time. The two ships carried about eight hundred passengers. \n\nGandhi\u2019s efforts to arouse Indian public opinion on the South \nAfrican issue had been reported, with exaggeration, in the South \nAfrican press. Now he was arriving with eight hundred free \nIndians. This provoked fierce resentment among the whites: \nGandhi, they charged, intended to flood Natal and the Transvaal \nwith unwanted, unindentured coloured people. Gandhi was of \ncourse innocent of recruiting or encouraging the travellers. \n\nAt first the ships were kept in quarantine, ostensibly because of \nthe plague in Bombay. But after the five-day quarantine period, \nnobody was permitted to come ashore. In Durban, meetings of \nwhites demanded that the ships and their passengers, including \nGandhi, be returned to India. Dada Abdulla received offers of \nreimbursement of losses if he sent the steamers back. The offers \nwere accompanied by veiled threats. He stood firm. \n\nOn January th, , at the end of twenty-three days\u2019 rocking- \noutside the harbour (following a three-week voyage from Bombay) \nthe Courland and Naderi were permitted to dock. But Mr. Harry \nEscombe, Attorney-General of the Natal government, who had \nopenly participated in the anti-Gandhi agitation, sent a message \nto Gandhi to land at dusk to avoid trouble. Mr. F. A. Laughton, \nan Englishman and legal counsellor of Dada Abdulla, advised \nagainst this procedure. Nor did Gandhi wish to enter the city by \nstealth. Mrs. Gandhi, who was pregnant, and the two boys accord- \n\n \" \n\n\nA MOB SCENE \n\n\ningly disembarked in normal fashion and were driven to the home \nof an Indian named Rustomji, while, by agreement, Gandhi and \nLaughton followed on foot. The clamouring crowds had dis\u00ac \npersed; but two small boys recognized Gandhi and shouted his \nname. Several whites appeared. Fearing a fight, Laughton \nhailed a Negro-drawn rickshaw. Gandhi had never used one and \nwas reluctant to do so now. The rickshaw boy, in any case, from \nfright ran away. As Gandhi and Laughton proceeded, the \ncrowd swelled and became violent. They isolated Gandhi from \nLaughton and threw stones, bricks and eggs at him. Then they \ncame closer, seized his turban and beat and kicked him. Gandhi \nfainted from pain but caught hold of the iron railings of a house. \nWhite men continued to smack his face and strike his body. At \nthis juncture, Mrs. Alexander, the wife of the Police Superintend\u00ac \nent, who knew Gandhi, happened to pass and she intervened and \nplaced herself between the maddened mob and the miserable \nGandhi. \n\nAn Indian boy summoned the police. Gandhi refused asylum \nin the police station but accepted a police escort to Rustomji\u2019s \nhouse. He was bruised all over and received immediate medical \nattention. \n\nThe city now knew Gandhi\u2019s whereabouts. White gangs \nsurrounded Rustomji\u2019s home and demanded that Gandhi be \ndelivered to them. \u2018We\u2019ll burn him,\u2019 they yelled. Superintendent \nAlexander was on the scene and tried, vainly, to calm or disperse \nthe howling mob. To humour them, Alexander led the singing of \n\nAnd we\u2019ll hang old Gandhi \nOn the sour apple tree, \n\nbut he sensed that the temper of the mob was rising and that \nthe house with all its inmates might be set on fire. Night had \nset in. Alexander secretly sent a message to Gandhi to escape in \ndisguise. The Superintendent put two detectives at Gandhi\u2019s \ndisposal. Gandhi donned an Indian policeman\u2019s uniform and a \nheadgear that looked like a helmet while the two white detectives \npainted their skins dark and dressed themselves as Indians. \nThe three then left by the rear of the house and, threading their \nway through side streets, reached the police station. \n\nWhen Alexander knew that Gandhi was safe, he informed the \n\ne m.g.  \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\ncrowd of the fact. This new situation required diplomatic hand\u00ac \nling and fortunately the police chief proved equal to it. \n\nGandhi remained in the safety of the police station for \nthree days. \n\nNews of the assault on Gandhi disturbed London. Joseph \nChamberlain, British Secretary of State for Colonies, cabled the \nNatal authorities to prosecute the attackers. Gandhi knew several \nof his assailants but refused to prosecute. He said it was not their \nfault; the blame rested on the community leaders and on the \nNatal government. \u2018This is a religious question with me,  Gandhi \ntold Attorney-General Escombe, and he would exercise \u2018self- \nrestraint  . \n\n\u2018Gandhi ought to have hated every white face to the end of his \nlife,  wrote Professor Edward Thompson of Oxford. But Gandhi \nforgave the whites in Durban who assembled to lynch him and \nhe forgave those who mauled and beat him. His soul kept no \nrecord of past sins against his body. Instead of prosecuting the \nguilty he pursued the more creative task of lightening his country\u00ac \nmen\u2019s lot. \n\nGandhi had been called back to South Africa to seize a happy \nopportunity. Under pressure exerted from London by the \nColonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, and from the British \ngovernment in India, the Natal legislature was debating a law \nto annul racial discrimination and replace it by an educational \ntest. This had been Gandhi\u2019s goal. The Natal Act, passed in \n, met his demand of equal electoral rights for British subjects, \nIndians included; the attempt to disfranchise the few hundred \nIndians was abandoned. Gandhi felt some satisfaction. Tempers \ncooled and tensions relaxed. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n",
    "1898-1902": "",
    "1903-1907": " CHAPTER VIII \n\n\nGANDHI GOES TO WAR \n\nI n the Boer War, which was waged in South Africa from  \nto  between Dutch settlers and the British, Gandhi\u2019s \npersonal sympathies \u2018were all with the Boers\u2019. Yet he volun\u00ac \nteered to serve with the British. \u2018Every single subject of a state,\u2019 \nhe explained, \u2018must not hope to enforce his opinion in all cases. \nThe authorities may not always be right, but as long as the sub\u00ac \njects owe allegiance to a state, it is their clear duty generally to \naccommodate themselves, and to accord their support, to the acts \nof the state.\u2019 \n\nThis is not the language or sentiment of a pacifist. Although \nthe Indians, Gandhi knew, were \u2018helots in the Empire\u2019, they were \nstill hoping to improve their condition within that empire and \nhere was \u2018a golden opportunity\u2019 to do so by supporting the \nBritish in the Boer War. \n\nThe Indians\u2019 claim for equal rights and fair treatment in South \nAfrica, lawyer Gandhi submitted, was based on their status as \nBritish subjects, and since they sought the advantages of British \ncitizenship they should also accept its obligations. \n\nThen Gandhi made a fine point: it could be said that this war \nand any war was immoral or anti-religious. Unless, however, a \nperson had taken that position and actively defended it before the \nwar he could not use it as a justification for abstention after \nhostilities had commenced. \n\nGandhi would have been more popular with his countrymen \nhad he advocated a do-nothing neutral policy. But it was unlike \nGandhi to be evasive. He accordingly offered to organize \nIndians as stretcher bearers and medical orderlies at the front \nor for menial work in hospitals. The Natal government rejected \nthe offer. Nevertheless, Gandhi and other Indians began, at their \nown expense, to train as nurses. They conveyed this information \nto the authorities together with certificates of physical fitness. \nAnpther rejection came. But the Boers were advancing, the dead \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\nwere piling up on the battlefield, and the wounded were receiving \ninadequate care. \n\nAfter much procrastination from prejudice, Natal sanctioned \nthe formation of an Indian Ambulance Corps. Three hundred \nfree Indians volunteered together with eight hundred indentured \nlabourers furloughed by their masters. England and South Africa \nwere impressed. \n\nGandhi led the corps. A photograph taken at the time shows \nhim in khaki uniform and broad-brimmed, jaunty, felt cowboy \nhat seated in the centre of twenty-one men similarly dressed. \nGandhi has a drooping moustache and, like the others, wears a \nRed Cross armband. He looks stern and small. Next to him is \nDr. Booth, a bulky English doctor with goatee who trained the \nvolunteers. The man standing above Gandhi has both his hands \non Gandhi\u2019s shoulders. \n\nThe corps members were African-born and Indian-born \nHindus, Moslems and Christians who lived together in natural \namity. Their relations with the Tommies were very friendly. The \npublic and the army admired the endurance and courage of \nGandhi\u2019s corps. In one sanguinary engagement at Spion Kop in \nJanuary , the British were being forced to retire and General \nBuller, the commanding officer, sent through a message saying \nthat although, by the terms of enlistment, the Indians were not to \nenter the firing line he would be thankful if they came up to remove \nthe wounded. Gandhi led his men on to the battlefield. For days \nthey worked under the fire of enemy guns and carried wounded \nsoldiers back to base hospital. The Indians sometimes walked as \nmuch as twenty-five miles a day. \n\nMr. Vere Stent, British editor of the Pretoria News , wrote an \narticle in the July  issue of the Johannesburg Illustrated Star \nabout a visit to the front during the Spion Kop battle. \u2018After a \nnight\u2019s work, which had shattered men with much bigger frames,\u2019 \nhe reported, \u2018I came across Gandhi in the early morning sitting \nby the roadside eating a regulation army biscuit. Every man in \nBuller\u2019s force was dull and depressed, and damnation was invoked \non everything. But Gandhi was stoical in his bearing, cheerful \nand confident in his conversations, and had a kindly eye. He did \none good. It was an informal introduction and it led to a friend\u00ac \nship. I saw the man and his small undisciplined corps on many a \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI GOES TO WAR \n\n\nbattlefield during the Natal campaign. When succour was to be \nrendered they were there. Their unassuming dauntlessness cost \nthem many lives and eventually an order was published forbidding \nthem to go into the firing line.\u2019 \n\nLater in  seasoned units arrived from England, fortune \nsmiled on British arms and the Indian Ambulance Corps was \ndisbanded. Gandhi and several comrades received the War \nMedal, and the corps was mentioned in dispatches. \n\nGandhi hoped that the fortitude of the Indians in war would \nappeal to South Africa\u2019s sense of fair play and help to moderate white \nhostility towards coloured Asiatics. Perhaps the two communities \nwould slowly grow closer together. He himself had no unspent \nbelligerence and no further plans or ambitions in South Africa; \nnothing foreshadowed the epic opportunity for leadership and \nrealization that awaited him there. He yearned to go home to \nIndia, and did \u2014 at the end of . He took his family. He \nsettled down in Bombay to practise law and enter politics. \n\nGandhi was forging ahead in both fields. In fact, he was \nbeginning to tread a path which led to the routine success of a \nmediocre lawyer who made money, joined committees and grew \na paunch, when a telegraphic summons from South Africa asked \nhim to return. He had promised to return if called. It pained him \nto break up his new life but it pleased him to be needed. Kasturbai \nand the boys remained in Bombay. Gandhi estimated that he \nmight be away four months to a year. \n\nJoseph Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary, was making a \ntrip to South Africa which the Indian community regarded as \nfateful, and they wanted their grievances presented to him by \nGandhi. Hence the summons. \n\nGandhi arrived in Durban near the end of . \n\nChamberlain, Gandhi assumed, had come to get a gift of thirty- \nfive million pounds from South Africa and to cement the post\u00ac \nwar bonds between Boers and British. The Colonial Secretary \ncertainly did not propose to antagonize the Boers. On the \ncontrary, every possible concession would be made to them. Very \nsoon, in fact, General Louis Botha, the Boer leader, became Prime \nMinister of the British-dominated Union of South Africa and Jan \nChristian Smuts, another Boer general and lawyer, its Minister of \nFinance and Defence. Britain was tending Boer wounds and did \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nnot intend, therefore, to wound Boer susceptibilities by redressing \nIndian grievances. In British Natal, accordingly, Chamberlain \nreceived an Indian delegation, listened to Gandhi\u2019s plea and \nanswered with chilling evasiveness; in the former Boer republic of \nTransvaal Gandhi was not even admitted into Chamberlain\u2019s \npresence, and those Indian representatives who were admitted got \nno greater satisfaction than seeing him. \n\nFrom repeated rumblings in the Transvaal it seemed that a \npolitical volcano might any day erupt and wipe out the entire \nIndian settlement. Gandhi therefore pitched his tent close to \nthe crater; he became a resident of Johannesburg, the largest \ncity of the Transvaal, opened a law office there and, without \nobjection from the bar association, won the right to practise \nbefore the Supreme Court. \n\nThe Transvaal government established an Asiatic Department \nto deal with Indians. This in itself was ominous; it suggested a \nracial approach. The Department, which Gandhi charged with \ncorruption, was manned, in the main, by British army officers who \nhad come from India during the Boer War and elected to stay. Their \nmentality was that of the white sahib in a colony of coloured inferiors. \n\nOne of the top Asiatic Department ideologues was Lionel \nCurtis, Assistant Colonial Secretary of the Transvaal, who later \nattained wider fame as a liberal apologist of imperialism. Gandhi \nwent to see him in  and Mr. Curtis wrote subsequently: \n\u2018Mr. Gandhi was, I believe, the first Oriental I ever met\u2019; but \nignorance has ever facilitated policy-making. Gandhi, Curtis \nsays, \u2018started by trying to convince me of the good points in the \ncharacter of his countrymen, their industry, frugality, their \npatience\u2019. Still the same Gandhian hope of winning friends by \ndisproving calumnies! But Curtis replied, \u2018Mr. Gandhi, you are \npreaching to the converted. It is not the vices of Indians that \nEuropeans in this country fear but their virtues.\u2019 \n\nIf the Indians in South Africa had consented to be \u2018hewers of \nwood and drawers of water\u2019 they would have had no trouble. \nBut the whites, unprepared to accept the Indians as equals, used \ntheir monopoly of political power to handicap the brown men \nfrom another part of the Empire. The purpose was unmistakable \nbecause frankly avowed. General Botha put it bluntly in an elec\u00ac \ntion speech at Standerton in January , when he declared, \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI GOES TO WAR \n\n\n\u2018If my party is returned to office we will undertake to drive the \ncoolies out of the country within four years.  And Smuts asserted \nin October , \u2018The Asiatic cancer, which has already eaten so \ndeeply into the vitals of South Africa, ought to be resolutely \neradicated.\u2019 These were the Asiatic Department\u2019s marching orders. \n\nGandhi stopped the whites far short of this goal. \n\nThroughout ,  and the first part of , the Transvaal \nAsiatic Department diligently carried out all anti-Indian regula\u00ac \ntions and showed special aptitude in inventing new ones. It \nlooked as though the existence of the ten thousand Indians of the \nTransvaal and of the more than one hundred thousand in South \nAfrica was in jeopardy; the threats of Botha and Smuts appeared \non the eve of being translated into actuality. \n\nGandhi was now the recognized leader of South Africa\u2019s \nIndian community. Tension between whites and Indians was \ngrowing. Nevertheless Gandhi forsook the political arena when \nthe Zulu \u2018rebellion\u2019 occurred in the first half of  and joined \nthe British army with a small group of twenty-four Indian \nvolunteers to serve as stretcher bearers and sanitary aids. Gandhi \nsaid he joined because he believed that \u2018the British Empire existed for \nthe welfare of the world\u2019; he had a \u2018genuine sense of loyalty\u2019 to it. \n\nThe \u2018rebellion\u2019 was really a punitive expedition or \u2018police \naction\u2019 which opened with the exemplary hanging of twelve \nZulus and continued to the last as a ghastly procession of shoot\u00ac \nings and floggings. Since white physicians and nurses would not \ntend sick and dying Zulus, the task was left to the Indians who \nwitnessed all the horrors of black men whipped till their skin \ncame off in strips. Gandhi\u2019s party sometimes came on the scene \nfive or six days after the whites had passed by and found the \nvictims suffering agony from open, suppurating wounds. The \nIndians marched as many as forty miles a day. \n\nAfter a month\u2019s service, the Indian unit was demobilized and \neach man honoured with a special medal. Gandhi had held the \nrank of sergeant-major. All members wore khaki uniform, this \ntime with puttees. \n\nWhen Gandhi returned from this expedition he was obliged to \nplunge into a cold war with the British which ended in an \nhistoric victory for moral force and brought him honour in India \nand fame throughout the world. \n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER X \n\n\nSEPTEMBER i ith,  \n\nN early three thousand persons filled the Imperial Theatre \nin Johannesburg. The big hall throbbed with the din of \nvoices which spoke the Tamil and Telugu languages of \nsouthern India, Gujarati and Hindi. The few women wore saris. \nThe men wore European and Indian clothes; some had Hindu \nturbans and caps, some Moslem headgear. Among them were rich \nmerchants, miners, lawyers, indentured labourers, waiters, rick\u00ac \nshaw boys, domestic servants, hucksters and poor shopkeepers. \nMany were delegates representing the eighteen thousand Indians \nof the Transvaal, now a British colony; they were meeting to \ndecide what to do about pending discriminatory enactments \nagainst Indians. Abdul Gani, chairman of the Transvaal British- \nIndian Association and the manager of a big business firm, pre\u00ac \nsided. Sheth Haji Habib delivered the main address. Mohandas \nK. Gandhi sat on the platform. \n\nGandhi had convened the meeting. On returning from service \nto the Zulus, and after acquainting Kasturbai with his celibacy \nvow, he had rushed off to Johannesburg in answer to a summons \nfrom the Indian community. The Transvaal Government Gazette of \nAugust nd, , had printed the draft of an ordinance to be \nsubmitted to the legislature. If adopted, Gandhi decided, it would \nspell \u2018absolute ruin for the Indians of South Africa . . . Better die \nthan submit to such a law\u2019. \n\n\u2018But how are we to die?\u2019 Gandhi wondered. He had no idea \nwhat to do. He only knew that the ordinance must be resisted; \nnowhere in the world, he believed, had free men been subjected \nto such humiliating, restrictive legislation. \n\nThe proposed ordinance required all Indian men and women, \nand children over eight, to register with the authorities, submit to \nfinger-printing and accept a certificate which they were to carry \nwith them at all times. A person who failed to register and leave \nhis fingerprints lost his right of residence and could be imprisoned, \nfined, or deported from the Transvaal. An Indian apprehended \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\non the street or anywhere without certificate could likewise be \nimprisoned, fined or deported even though he owned valuable \nproperty or engaged in important commercial transactions. \n\nThe Indians were incensed. This act was directed specifically \nagainst Indians and was therefore an affront to them and to India. \nIf passed it would be the beginning of similar laws in other parts \nof South Africa; in the end, no Indian could remain in South \nAfrica. Moreover, the ordinance would permit a police officer to \naccost an Indian woman on the street or enter her home and ask \nfor her registration document. In view of the complete or partial \naloofness in which Indian women lived, this feature of the measure \nwas highly offensive both to Moslems and Hindus. \u2018If anyone \ncame forward to demand a certificate from my wife,\u2019 exclaimed an \nirate Indian at a preliminary committee meeting attended by \nGandhi, T would shoot him on the spot and take the \nconsequences.\u2019 \n\nThat was the mood of the mass meeting in the Imperial Theatre. \n\nOrchestra, balcony and gallery were crowded long before the \nchairman opened the proceedings. Angry speeches in four \nlanguages stirred the volatile audience to a high emotional pitch \nand then Sheth Haji Habib read a resolution, which Gandhi had \nhelped to prepare, demanding non-compliance with the registra\u00ac \ntion provisions. Haji Habib called on the assembly to adopt it, \nbut not in the usual manner. They must vote, he urged, \u2018with \nGod as their witness\u2019. \n\nGandhi started. A sensitive ear and a keen intuition quickly \ntold him that this was an extraordinary event. An action with \nGod as witness was a religious vow which could not be broken. \nIt was not the ordinary motion passed by a show of hands ai a \npublic function and immediately forgotten. \n\nGandhi then spoke. He begged them to consider coolly what \nthey were doing. \u2018Notwithstanding the differences of nomencla\u00ac \nture in Hinduism and Islam,\u2019 he declared, \u2018we all believe in one \nand the same God. To pledge ourselves or to take an oath in \nthe name of God or with Him as a witness is not something to \nbe trifled with. If having taken such an oath we violate our pledge \nwe are guilty before God and man. Personally, I hold that a man \nwho deliberately and knowingly takes a pledge and breaks it \nforfeits his manhood ... A man who lightly pledges his word and \n\n \n\n\nSEPTEMBER iith,  \n\nthen breaks it becomes a man of straw and fits himself for punish\u00ac \nment here as well as hereafter.\u2019 \n\nHaving warned them, he tried to stir them. If ever a crisis in \ncommunity affairs warranted a vow, now was the time. Caution \nhad its place but also its limits. \u2018The government has taken leave \nof all sense of decency. We will be revealing our unworthiness \nand cowardice if we cannot stake our all in the face of the con\u00ac \nflagration that envelops us. . . \n\nThe purpose of the resolution was not to impress the outside \nworld. A vote in favour constituted a personal vow and each one \nof them had to decide whether he possessed the inner strength to \nkeep it. In consequence of the vow, they might be jailed; in \nprison they might be beaten and insulted. They might go hungry \nand be exposed to heat and cold. They might lose their jobs, their \nwealth. They might be deported. The struggle might last a long \ntime, years. \u2018But I can boldly declare and with certainty,\u2019 \nGandhi exclaimed, \u2018that so long as there is even a handful of men \ntrue to their pledge, there can be only one end to the struggle \u2014 \nand that is victory.\u2019 \n\nThe audience applauded. He lowered his voice. Many in the \nhall, moved by the enthusiasm and indignation which dominated \nthe meeting, might pledge themselves that evening and repent the \nnext morning or the next month. Perhaps only a handful would \nbe left to face the final contest with the powerful government. To \nhim it would make no difference. \u2018There is only one course open \nto me,\u2019 Gandhi asserted, \u2018to die but not to submit to the law. Even \nif the unlikely happened and everyone else flinched, leaving me to \nface the music alone, I am confident that I will never violate my \npledge. Please do not misunderstand me. I am not saying this \nout of vanity. But I wish to put you and especially the leaders on \nthe platform, on your guard ... If you have not the will or the \nability to stand firm even when you are perfectly isolated you \nmust not only not take the pledge but you must declare your \nopposition before the resolution is put. . . Although we are going \nto take the pledge in a body, no one may imagine that default on \nthe part of one or of many can absolve the rest from their obliga\u00ac \ntion. Every one must be true to his pledge even unto death, no \nmatter what others do.\u2019 \n\nGandhi sat down. The chairman added his sobering words. \n\n  \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nThen the vote was taken. Everyone present rose, raised his hand \nand swore to God not to obey the proposed anti-Indian ordinance \nif it became law. \n\nThe next day, September  th, the Imperial Theatre was \ncompletely destroyed by fire. Many Indians regarded it as an \nomen that the ordinance would meet a similar fate. To Gandhi \nit was a coincidence. He did not believe in such omens. Fate did \nnot beckon to Gandhi with mute signs. The future spoke in him \nthrough that awesome, Himalayan self-assurance which he dis\u00ac \nplayed at the meeting. He knew he could stand alone. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER IX \n\n\nTHE TRANSFORMATION BEGINS \n\nT h e Gandhi who worsted the South African government in \nprolonged combat had first conquered himself and trans\u00ac \nformed his living habits and inner essence. That altered his \nrelations with Kasturbai and their children. \n\nA photograph of Mrs. Gandhi on her first arrival in South \nAfrica in  \u2014 at twenty-eight \u2014 shows her a beautiful woman, \nelegantly dressed in a rich, silk sari. The fine oval face with eyes \nwide apart, well-formed nose, delicately curved lips and perfectly \nshaped chin must have made her very attractive indeed. She was \nnot as tall as Gandhi. He was photographed on the same occasion \nin a European suit, stiff white collar and stiff white shirt, a gay, \nstriped necktie and a round button in his lapel buttonhole. On \nhis head is a thin skull-cap. In a second exposure he is without \nhead-dress. His full lips begin to reflect the will-power tempered \nby powerful emotional self-control which they later expressed so \neloquently. But on the whole he looks the average Indian, Euro\u00ac \npeanized by constant imitation of the white world. \n\nHarilal and Manilal, their two sons who came with them to \nSouth Africa, were dressed in knee-length coats and long, Western \ntrousers. They wore shoes and stockings; they had not worn them \nin India. Neither had Kasturbai. All three disliked them and \ncomplained to the head of the family that their feet felt cramped \nand the stockings stank. But Gandhi used his authority to compel \nobedience. He also inflicted the Western torture of knives and \nforks at meals; finger-eating had been so much more comfortable \nand tasty. \n\nGandhi earned five to six thousand pounds a year from his \nlegal work \u2014 a very big income in those days in South Africa. \nAt one time, in Durban, he rented an English villa at the \nbeach a few doors from the Attorney-General\u2019s home, and always \nhis life resembled that of the professional man who had made \ngood. \n\nBefore going to study law in London, Gandhi had yearned to be \n\n \n\n\nTHE TRANSFORMATION BEGINS \n\na doctor, and in effect he always was. He offered free medical \nadvice to most of his legal clients. One of them, Lutavasinh, was \nasthmatic. Gandhi induced him to fast and give up smoking. \nLater, Gandhi put him on a diet of rice, milk and marmalade for \na month. \u2018At the end of the month,\u2019 Gandhi boasted years later, \n\u2018he was free from asthma.\u2019 \n\nAn Indian business man\u2019s son became ill suddenly; the doctor \nadvised an operation. Gandhi was summoned. To calm the \nfather, Gandhi agreed to be present at the operation. The child \ndied under the knife; Gandhi never shook off the impression. \n\nGandhi was also Kasturbai\u2019s midwife. He had studied a \npopular work on childbirth, which constituted a full course in \nobstetrics and infant care, and, when labour came too swiftly for \nprofessional help to be fetched, Gandhi himself delivered his \nfourth son, Devadas, May rd, . \u2018I was not nervous,\u2019 he said. \nFor two months after the birth of Devadas and also for a while \nafter the birth of Ramdas, his third son, in South Africa in , \nGandhi employed a nurse; she helped Kasturbai in the household. \nBut caring for infants \u2018I did myself\u2019, Gandhi writes. \n\nGandhi was constantly interfering in household matters; that \nincensed Kasturbai. He considered himself her teacher, which \nannoyed her. He imposed new, rigid rules of behaviour. The \n\u2018blind, infatuated\u2019 love he gave Kasturbai was a diminishing \nrecompense for these tribulations. But \u2018A Hindu wife,\u2019 Gandhi \ndeclared, \u2018regards implicit obedience to her husband as the highest \nreligion. A Hindu husband regards himself as the lord and master \nof his wife who must ever dance attendance upon him.\u2019 Gandhi, \nin this period, was a very Hindu husband. He thought himself \n\u2018a cruelly kind\u2019 spouse. At times, Kasturbai would have failed \nto notice the kindness. \n\nFrequently, Gandhi\u2019s friends and his law clerks and assistants, \nwhom he treated like sons, stayed with him. Among these non\u00ac \npaying boarders was Sheik Mehtab, his athletic, meat-eating \nboyhood friend. Gandhi had brought him along on his second trip \nfrom India. Mehtab had hardly settled in the Gandhi household \nwhen he began secretly to introduce prostitutes into his room. \nGandhi was informed but he refused to believe it until on one \noccasion he caught Mehtab in the act. Mehtab had to leave the \nhouse. Later Mehtab married and reformed and wrote mediocre \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\ninspirational verse for the Gandhian passive resisters; his wife \nwent to prison as a passive resister. \n\nThere was no running water in the Gandhi home.; each room \nhad a chamber pot. Gandhi would not employ an untouchable \n\u2018sweeper\u2019 who in India does all \u2018unclean\u2019 tasks. He and Kasturbai \ncarried out the pots. She had no choice; he insisted. But one clerk \nhad been an untouchable himself and had become a Christian in \norder to escape the ugly disabilities which Hindus inflict on their \n\u2018outcasts\u2019. To the orthodox Kasturbai, however, he remained an \nuntouchable and she balked at cleaning his pot. In fact she hated \nthe whole business and did not see why she, or her husband for \nthat matter, should perform such tasks. Gandhi compelled her to \nobey; he considered it part of her \u2018education\u2019. But she cried and \nher eyes were red with anger and tears. He protested; not only \nmust she do this work but she had to do it cheerfully and when he \nsaw her weep, he shouted, \u2018I will not have this nonsense in my house.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Keep your house to yourself and let me go,\u2019 she screamed. \n\nGandhi grabbed her by the hand, dragged her to the gate, \nopened it and was about to push her out. \n\n\u2018Have you no shame?\u2019 she exclaimed through copious tears. \n\u2018Where am I to go? I have no parents or relatives here. For \nHeaven\u2019s sake, behave yourself and shut the gate. Let us not be \nfound making scenes like this.\u2019 \n\nThis brought Gandhi to his senses. He possessed a temper and \ntemperament, and his subsequent Mahatma-calm was the product \nof training. \n\nIn  Gandhi decided to return to India. On the eve of his \ndeparture \u2014 with his family \u2014 the Indian community outdid \nitself in concrete demonstrations of gratitude. He was presented \nwith numerous gold and silver objects and diamond ornaments. \nFor Kasturbai there was a very valuable gold necklace. \n\nGandhi had received gifts when he left for India in . They \nwere not like these; they were small, personal tokens of apprecia\u00ac \ntion which he had accepted easily in that spirit. Since then, \nmoreover, his view of personal possessions had been gradually \nchanging. He was beginning to see danger in wealth and property. \nHe had been pleading with people to conquer their infatuation \nfor jewellery. Yet now he himself owned more than anybody \nwhom he had tried to convert. \n\n\n \n\n\nTHE TRANSFORMATION BEGINS \n\n\nAfter the presentation party he went home and spent a sleepless \nnight. The gifts might be construed as payment for services which \nhe had rendered with no thought of material gain. He wanted to \ngive them up. But he saw the advantage of retention. Torn \nbetween the yearning for financial security and the desire for the \nfreedom derived from owning nothing, he paced up and down for \nhours arguing with himself. He was also aware that he faced a \nfamily crisis if he decided to return the gifts. Kasturbai would \nprotest; he would be making her unhappy. But by morning his \nmind was made up: the gifts must go. \n\nHe had won his own battle. Could he convince Kasturbai? \n\nFirst, in order to make the renunciation a fact beyond family \ndispute, he drafted a letter which elaborated a plan of using the \ngifts to create a community fund. Then he proceeded to recruit \nHarilal and Manilal, his first and second born. They were readily \npersuaded. They had no interest in jewels and no objection to his \nemerging new philosophy of austerity. Besides, Papa was a \ncompelling debater. \n\n\u2018Let\u2019s return them,\u2019 they agreed. \n\n\u2018Then you will plead with your mother, won\u2019t you?\u2019 Gandhi \nhinted. \n\n\u2018Certainly,\u2019 the young boys said with alacrity. \u2018Just leave it to \nus. She does not need ornaments. She would want them for us, \nand if we don\u2019t want them why should she not part with them?\u2019 \n\nBut the boys failed to move Kasturbai. Gandhi came to their \naid. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s all very well for you,\u2019 Kasturbai started calmly. \u2018You don\u2019t \ncare for jewels. You don\u2019t wear them. And it\u2019s easy enough for \nyou to influence the boys. They\u2019ll always dance to your tune. \nAs for me, I have already obeyed your order not to wear trinkets. \nAfter all the talking you\u2019ve done about other people not wearing \njewels it would not do for me to wear them. But what about my \ndaughters-in-law?\u2019 she said with bitterness and growing deter\u00ac \nmination. \u2018They will be sure to want them.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Well,\u2019 Gandhi put in mildly, \u2018the children aren\u2019t married yet. \nWe\u2019ve always said they must not marry young. When they are \ngrown up they can take care of themselves. And surely we will \nnot chose brides for our sons who are fond of jewellery.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Young things like pretty things,\u2019 argued Kasturbai. \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\nGandhi tried to soothe. \u2018Well/ he said, \u2018if they do, if after all we \nhave to provide them with ornaments, I shall be hem You will \nask me then.\u2019 \n\nThat infuriated Kasturbai. \u2018Ask you! I know you by this time. \nYou took my jewellery away from me. Imagine you offering to \nget jewels for your daughters-in-law! You, who are trying to \nmake monks of my boys. \n\n\u2018No,\u2019 she shouted, \u2018the ornaments will not be returned.\u2019 \n\nThe Hindu wife was defiant. \u2018Besides,\u2019 she exclaimed, \u2018the \nnecklace is mine. You have no right to return that.\u2019 This was a \nretreat. She had given up hope of their keeping all the jewels. \nAt least, the necklace. \n\nEager to mollify her, Gandhi nevertheless was hard. \u2018Was the \nnecklace given to you for your service or for my service?\u2019 he asked \nrhetorically. \n\nKasturbai burst into tears. \u2018It\u2019s the same thing,\u2019 she sobbed. \n\u2018Service rendered by you is as though rendered by me. I have \ntoiled and moiled for you day and night. Is that no service? You \nforced all and sundry guests upon me, making me weep bitter \ntears and I slaved for them.\u2019 \n\nGandhi knew this was a just reproach. But he did not admit it \nat the moment. He was determined to return the jewels and \ncreate the community fund. He was \u2018definitely of the opinion that \na public worker should accept no costly gifts\u2019. He was beginning \nto believe that he should own nothing costly, whether given or \nearned. Against this powerful impulse which would soon reach \nfull flower and alter his entire mode of life, Kasturbai had no \nargument. Hers was the instinctive, million-year-old female \ndesire for adornment and the fear, equally primitive, of material \nwant. But a plea for acquisitiveness could not stand against \nGandhi\u2019s penchant for renunciation, nor could Kasturbai induce \nhim to prefer self-enrichment to community service. In the end, \nhe simply asserted his male authority and announced that the \n gifts and those of , would be surrendered to trustees. \nSo it was, and the fund, augmented from other sources, served \nSouth African Indians for decades thereafter. \n\nShortly after this episode, Gandhi, having returned to India \nand rented a home and chambers in Bombay, received a call at \nhis office from an American insurance agent. The agent had a \n\n \n\n\nTHE TRANSFORMATION BEGINS \n\n\n\u2018pleasant countenance\u2019 and \u2018a sweet tongue\u2019. He discussed \nGandhi\u2019s future \u2018as though we were old friends\u2019. In America, the \nagent said, \u2018a person like you would always carry insurance; life \nis uncertain\u2019. Moreover, \u2018It\u2019s a religious duty to be insured.\u2019 \nThis impressed Gandhi; he had believed that faith in God made \nan insurance policy superfluous. \u2018And what about your family?\u2019 \nthe agent continued. Gandhi knew that his surrender of the \nfortune in jewels had intensified Kasturbai\u2019s insecurity. What \nwould happen to her and the boys if he died; would it be right \nagain to burden his generous brother who had already spent so \nmuch money on them? So Gandhi took out an insurance policy \nfor ten thousand rupees or, roughly, a thousand pounds in values \nof that time. The glib American agent subverted the future \nMahatma. The future Mahatma had not yet solved his psycho\u00ac \nlogical problems. \n\nHardly had the family found itself in Bombay than Manilal, \naged ten, went down with a severe case of typhoid complicated, \nbefore long, by pneumonia. At night, the boy had a very high \ntemperature. \n\nA Parsi doctor was called. He said there was no effective medi\u00ac \ncine. Everything depended on proper diet and good nursing. He \nrecommended chicken broth and eggs. \n\n\u2018But we are absolute vegetarians,\u2019 Gandhi told the doctor. \n\n\u2018Your son\u2019s life is in danger,\u2019 the doctor cautioned. \u2018We could \ngive him milk diluted with water but that will not provide enough \nnourishment.\u2019 The Parsi physician said many of his Hindu \npatients were vegetarians but in serious illnesses they obeyed his \ninstructions. \n\nGandhi replied, \u2018Even for life itself we may not do certain things. \nRightly or wrongly it is part of my religious conviction that man \nmay not eat eggs and meat. It is in crises such as this that a per\u00ac \nson\u2019s faith is truly tested.\u2019 To be a vegetarian in normal circum\u00ac \nstances and take meat when the body is under stress would mock \nvegetarianism. Gandhi accordingly told the doctor he would \npersist. \u2018I propose, in addition,\u2019 Gandhi declared, \u2018to try some \nhydropathic remedies which I happen to know.\u2019 He had been \nreading pamphlets on water cure by a Dr. Kuhne of Leipzig. \n\nGandhi informed Manilal about this conversation. The boy \nwas too weak to do more than assent. The father now assumed \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\ncomplete charge of the patient. He gave Manilal several three- \nminute hot hip baths a day and starved him on diluted orange \njuice for three days. \n\nBut the temperature remained at . Manilal was delirious. \nGandhi worried. He worried about what people would say, what \nhis elder brother Laxmidas, now the head of the family, would \nsay. And Kasturbai was anxious and angry. Should he try \nanother physician, or perhaps consult an expert in ancient \nIndian aryuvedic medicine? \n\nOn the other hand, he said to himself, The thread of life is in \nGod\u2019s hand; and God must be pleased by my adherence to \nvegetarianism and natural cures\u2019. \n\nThe boy\u2019s condition became extremely critical. Gandhi decided \nto give him a wet pack. He dipped a bedsheet in water, wrung it \nout, wrapped it around Manilal\u2019s body, covered him with two \nblankets, and put a wet towel to the head. \n\nManilal\u2019s body was hot and dry. Gandhi was frantic. The boy \nwas not perspiring. Kasturbai fretted. Gandhi put her in charge, \ntelling her strictly not to alter anything; he himself felt he had to \nleave the house to lessen the tension within him. He walked the \nstreets and prayed, calling, \u2018God, God, God, God, please, God.\u2019 \n\nExcited, exhausted, he returned home. \n\n\u2018It is you Bapu,\u2019 Manilal said to his father. \n\n\u2018Yes, darling,\u2019 Gandhi replied. \n\nT am burning, take me out.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Just a few more minutes, son. You are perspiring. You will \nsoon be well.\u2019 \n\n\u2018No, Bapu, I cannot stand it any longer. I am burning up.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Another minute. It will relieve you.\u2019 \n\nGandhi opened the sheet and wiped the body dry. Then they \nboth fell asleep in the same bed. Next morning the fever was \ndown. Gradually, it disappeared. Gandhi kept the boy on \ndiluted milk and fruit juices for forty days until he was com\u00ac \npletely recovered. \n\nWas it hydropathy? Or diet? It happens that Gandhi did the \nright thing from the medical point of view. Orange juice and \nmilk were at least as good as, perhaps better than, eggs and \nchicken. But Gandhi ascribed Manilal\u2019s delivery to \u2018God\u2019s grace\u2019. \n\n\u2018God saved my honour,\u2019 he said. \n\n \n\n\nTHE TRANSFORMATION BEGINS \n\n\nGandhi had settled down in Bombay, but in  he was again \nrecalled to South Africa. He now realized that he would be there \nfor a long time and sent for his wife and three boys; Harilal, \nthe eldest, remained in India. Gandhi resumed his lucrative law \npractice in Johannesburg. \n\nGandhi insisted that his clients tell him the whole truth; he \ndropped many cases when he discovered that he had been \ndeceived. The lawyer\u2019s duty, he held, was not to prove the guilty \ninnocent but to help the court to arrive at the truth. \n\nIf a person, wishing to retain him, made a confession of wrong\u00ac \ndoing, Gandhi would say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you plead guilt/ and take \nthe penalty?\u2019 He thought there was too much litigation for com\u00ac \nmunity health and individual morality. \u2018A true lawyer,\u2019 he de\u00ac \nclared, \u2018is one who places truth and service in the first place and \nthe emoluments of the profession in the next place only.\u2019 But \nthe true lawyer, he found, was a rarity. Lawyers often lied, \nmoney talked, and witnesses consciously perjured themselves. \n\nEven as a lawyer his primary impulse was to change men. He \nrespected no precedent, tradition, enactment, or habit that ob\u00ac \nstructed a change he aspired to introduce. He changed his own \nhabits with the greatest alacrity. \n\nGandhi suffered from occasional rheumatic inflammation, head\u00ac \naches and constipation. Though a vegetarian he was a heavy \neater. He concluded that he overate. Having heard of the forma\u00ac \ntion in England (Manchester) of a No-Breakfast Association, he \ndispensed with the morning meal and the headaches and other \nphysical ailments disappeared. Thereafter he took no more \nlaxatives or medicines. Instead, if necessary he applied a poultice \nof clean earth moistened with cold water to his abdomen; this \nworked alimentary miracles. Simultaneously, he adopted a diet \nbased on sun-baked fruits and nuts. Grapes and almonds, accord\u00ac \ning to his researches, were adequate nourishment for the tissues \nand nerves. \n\nHe walked to and from his law office. As long as the family \nwas in Johannesburg the children accompanied him \u2014 a distance \nof five miles in all. In the office he became an expert typist. \n\nOnce a white barber refused to cut Gandhi\u2019s hair. Without \nblaming the barber (\u2018There was every chance of his losing his \ncustom if he should serve black men. We do not allow our barbers \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nto serve our untouchable brethren\u2019) Gandhi bought a pair of \nclippers and thenceforth cut his own hair and that of the boys. \n\nGandhi wore stiff white collars, but the laundry was expensive \nand, besides, it returned work so slowly that he had to have \nseveral dozen collars. He took to washing and starching them \nhimself. The first time he did it he used too much starch and the \niron was not hot enough. In court, the starch began dropping off the \ncollar and Gandhi\u2019s colleagues laughed. But \u2018in the course of time \nI became an expert washerman\u2019. He saw \u2018the beauty of self-help\u2019. \n\nIn  Gandhi joined a group of Christians and Theosophists \ncalled the Seekers\u2019 Club. They frequently read the Bhagavad Gita \ntogether. Spurred by this activity Gandhi began studying the \nGita again. His morning toilet required thirty-five minutes, \n\u2018fifteen minutes for the toothbrush\u2019, an old Indian custom, and \ntwenty minutes for bathing. While cleaning his teeth, he memor\u00ac \nized the Gita. Its outstanding lesson to him now was \u2018non\u00ac \npossession\u2019. Straightway he allowed his Bombay American \ninsurance policy to lapse. \u2018God would take care\u2019 of the family. \n\nBut \u2018were not wife and children possessions?\u2019 \n\nThe discussions at the Seekers led him to introspection. He \nconcluded that his emotions were undisciplined and that he lacked \n\u2018equability\u2019. To be equable he would have to treat family, friend \nand foe alike. This was Gita \u2018detachment\u2019. \n\nOne evening Gandhi went to an \u2018At Home\u2019 of the proprietress \nof his favourite vegetarian restaurant. There he met a young man \nnamed Henry S. L. Polak, born at Dover in , who had be\u00ac \ncome a vegetarian after reading Count Leo Tolstoy. Polak also \nknew Adolf Just\u2019s Return to Nature , a treatise on nature cures which \nGandhi cherished. They talked, found much in common and \nbecame friends. Polak was assistant editor of the Transvaal Critic. \nHe had \u2018a wonderful faculty\u2019, Gandhi said, \u2018of translating into \npractice anything that appealed to his intellect. Some of the \nchanges he had made in his life were as prompt as they were \nradical\u2019. This description of what Gandhi liked in Polak is a \ndescription of Gandhi. \n\nSome months earlier, in , Gandhi had helped to start a \nweekly magazine called Indian Opinion. The paper was in diffi\u00ac \nculties, and to cope with them at first hand Gandhi took a trip \nto Durban where the magazine was published. Polak saw him \n\n \n\n\nTHE TRANSFORMATION BEGINS \n\noff at the station and gave him a book to read for the long \njourney. It was John Ruskin\u2019s Unto This Last. \n\nRuskin\u2019s influence during his lifetime was very great, as art \ncritic, essayist and writer on ethics, sociology and economics. \nHis monumental Fors Clavigera, in eight volumes published between \n and , preached the dignity of manual labour, urged the \nsimple life, and stressed the debilitating complexities of the modern \neconomic system. \n\nRuskin was sometimes contemptuous of the society in which he \nlived. \u2018How much\u2019, he demanded in Sesame and Lilies , \u2018do you \nthink we spend on libraries, public and private, as compared with \nwhat we spend on our horses? . . . Or, to go lower still, how much \ndo you think the contents of the book-shelves of the United \nKingdom, private and public, would fetch, as compared with the \ncontents of its wine-cellars?\u2019 \n\nThe same iconoclastic spirit permeates Unto This Last: Four \nEssays on the First Principles of Political Economy , first published serially \nin the London Cornhill Magazine and in Harper\u2019s, New York, in \ni and later in book form. Of this work, forty years later, \nGandhi said that it was written with \u2018blood and tears\u2019. \n\n\u2018Riches\u2019, Ruskin declared, \u2018are a power like that of electricity, \nacting through inequalities or negations of itself. The force of the \nguinea you have in your pocket depends wholly on the default of \na guinea in your neighbour\u2019s pocket. If he did not want it, it \nwould be of no use to you.\u2019 When he is poor and long out of work \nthe guinea is more valuable to you. Therefore, \u2018what is really \ndesired, under the name of riches, is, essentially, power over men\u2019. \n\nConsequently, men should seek \u2018not greater wealth, but simpler \npleasure; not higher fortune but deeper felicity; making the first \nof possessions, self-possession; and honouring themselves in the \nharmless pride and calm pursuits of peace\u2019. \n\nRemembering that \u2018what one person has, another cannot have\u2019, \nthe rich should abstain from luxuries until all, the poorest too, \nshall have enough, \u2018until the time come and the kingdom, when \nChrist\u2019s gift of bread and bequest of peace shall be unto this last \nas unto thee. . . .\u2019 \n\nTo Gandhi it meant: only that economy is good which conduces \nto the good of all. This Gandhi had known. The second lesson, \nwhich he had \u2018dimly realized\u2019, was that \u2018a lawyer\u2019s work has the \n\nf m.g.  \n\n\nM.G. \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nsame value as the barber\u2019s, inasmuch as all have the same right of \nearning their livelihood for their work\u2019. Gandhi derived this \ninterpretation from one sentence in Ruskin\u2019s book: \u2018A labourer \nserves his country with his spade, just as a man in the middle rank \nof life serves it with the sword, the pen, or the lancet.\u2019 But Ruskin \ndid not say, as Gandhi did, that the work of all \u2018has the same value\u2019. \nOn the contrary, Ruskin stressed, more than anything else, \u2018the \nimpossibility of Equality\u2019 between men. He merely contended \nthat the underprivileged must find protection in the morality of \nthe fortunate. Ruskin hoped to alleviate the hardships of in\u00ac \nequality by an appeal to the conscience of the devout. \n\nThe third lesson of Unto This Last \u2014 \u2018that the life of labour, that \nis, the life of the tiller of the soil and the handicraftsman, is the \nlife worth living\u2019 \u2014 was completely new to Gandhi. But these are \nGandhi\u2019s words; the teaching, though not alien to Ruskin, is \nscarcely to be found in the four essays. Ruskin merely suggested, \nin a footnote, that the rich would be healthier with \u2018lighter dinner \nand more work\u2019 while the poor could do with more dinner and \nlighter work. \n\nGandhi, who had never read Ruskin, started reading Unto This \nLast the moment the train left Johannesburg and read all night. \n\u2018That book\u2019, he said in October , \u2018marked the turning point \nin my life.\u2019 He immediately decided \u2018to change my life in accord\u00ac \nance with the ideals of the book\u2019. He would go to live on a farm \nwith his family and associates. \n\nAs Gandhi read his deepest convictions into the Gita , so he wove \nhis own notions into Ruskin. Those books appealed to him most \nwhich were closest to his concept of life and, where they deviated, \nhe brought them closer by interpreting them. \u2018It was a habit with \nme\u2019, Gandhi once wrote, \u2018to forget what I did not like and to \ncarry out in practice whatever I liked.\u2019 \n\nRuskin, Gandhi observed in , \u2018was content to revolutionize \nhis mind\u2019 but lacked the strength to change his life. Gandhi \nsuffered from no such deficiency. Bent on establishing a Walden \non the veldt, he acted quickly. He bought a farm near Phoenix, \na town fourteen miles from Durban. Situated on a hill, it con\u00ac \nsisted of a hundred acres with a well, some orange, mulberry and \nmango trees and one dilapidated cottage. It cost a thousand \npounds. Several rich Indians helped with money. One Indian \n\n \n\n\nTHE TRANSFORMATION BEGINS \n\n\nfriend contributed quantities of corrugated iron for houses. \nGandhi would have preferred mud huts with thatched roofs, but \nhis colleagues vetoed that. \n\nWithout delay, the presses and offices of Indian Opinion were \ntransferred to the farm. Albert West, the British editor of the \nmagazine, whom Gandhi had met in a vegetarian restaurant, \ngave instant agreement to this startling project. They fixed a \nmonthly allowance of three pounds for editor, errand boy and \ncompositor. That was in . The magazine is still published \nin the same place by Manilal Gandhi. \n\nFor a while, Gandhi\u2019s law practice required his presence in \nJohannesburg. He could not yet liberate himself for the new life \nat Phoenix. He wrote much of the matter that went into Indian \nOpinion and personally covered most of its deficits, which amounted \nto many pounds a month. He did a great deal of legal work for \nIndians who entrusted him not only with their litigations but also \nwith their savings. The Indian indentured labourers knew Gandhi \nas their champion with the authorities and in the courts. He also \ndoctored them. Those who became free and accumulated wealth \noften gave him their money to keep; they had no knowledge of \nbanking and little faith in the whites. \n\nA proprietor was seeking funds to expand a vegetarian dining \nroom. Gandhi had a large sum belonging to Badri, a former serf. \n\u2018Badri,\u2019 said Gandhi, \u2018may I use your money to help this restau\u00ac \nrant? It requires a thousand pounds.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Brother,\u2019 Badri replied, \u2018give away the money if you like. I \nknow nothing in these matters. I know only you.\u2019, \n\nGandhi lent the proprietor the money. In three months the \nrestaurant failed. Gandhi paid back the money out of his own pocket. \n\nHenry Polak was assisting with the magazine, but Gandhi \nneeded him in his law business too, and so Polak, who had \nsettled on the Phoenix farm, came to live in Gandhi\u2019s Johannes\u00ac \nburg home which always resembled an Indian joint family except \nthat in the Gandhi household not only blood relatives but friends, \nco-workers, employees and political associates resided under one \nroof. Gandhi paid the expenses. \n\nPolak wanted to get married; he had postponed it for financial \nreasons. But having made him a member of the joint Gandhi \nfamily, Gandhi urged him to marry. \u2018You are now mine,\u2019 \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nGandhi said. \u2018Your concern about yourself and your children is \nmy concern. It is I who am marrying you and I do not see any \nobjection to your marrying immediately.\u2019 Polak brought his \nbride from England. She was a Christian, Polak a Jew, but their \nreal religion, Gandhi said, \u2018was the religion of ethics\u2019. Ever shap\u00ac \ning others\u2019 lives, Gandhi also persuaded Albert West to marry. \nWest went to Scotland and returned with a wife, a mother-in-law \nand a sister. They were embraced in the joint family. At this \nstage of his life, Gandhi was interested in marrying off all his \nbachelor friends. \n\nThe expanding Johannesburg household adopted the practice \nof maximum manual self-service. Instead of buying bread, un\u00ac \nleavened wholemeal biscuits were baked at home after a recipe of \nthe remote but omnipresent Dr. Kuhne of Leipzig, author of The \nNew Science of Healing. For health and economy reasons, the flour \nwas ground in a handmill with a huge iron wheel. Gandhi, the \nchildren and the Polaks took turns at this arduous labour. \u2018Good \nexercise for the boys,\u2019 said their exacting father. The boys also \ndid the chamber-pot chores. \n\nDuring  and , Gandhi, Kasturbai and their sons lived \nnow in Johannesburg, now at Phoenix Farm. In both places, the \nproblem of restraint and self-control preoccupied him. He began \nto fast, like his mother, whenever an occasion presented itself. \nOn the other days, he ate two meagre meals of fruits and nuts. \nBut after a fast he enjoyed his food more and wanted to eat more. \nFasts therefore could lead to indulgence! Gandhi\u2019s goal was the \n\u2018disembodiment\u2019 and \u2018desirelessness\u2019 which, in Hindu thought, \nconduces to union with God. Mere abstention does not meet the \nGita ideal; craving too must be absent. If reduced food consump\u00ac \ntion stimulated the appetite the restraint was negatived. \n\nHis task, therefore, was to conquer the palate. As a minimum, \nhe dispensed with spices and seasoning. Now began his lifelong \nsearch for a diet which, while sustaining animal man, lifted the \nmind above the animal. \n\nIf he did not curb his passion for food, how could he curb \nstronger passions: anger, vanity and sex? We live, Gandhi \nargued, not in order to provide food, clothing and shelter for the \nbody. We provide food, clothing and shelter for the body in order \nto live. Material things are only the means to a spiritual end. \n\n \n\n\nTHE TRANSFORMATION BEGINS \n\n\nWhen they become the end, the sole end, as they usually are, life \nloses content and discontent afflicts mankind. The soul, alas, \nneeds a temporary abode, but a clean mud hut will do as well as \na palace, much better in fact. The body must be kept alive, not \npampered. To achieve release for the spirit, the body must be \nsubjected to the discipline of the mind. \n\nThe denial of ordinary pleasures is masochism, a Westerner \nmight say. Yet the Christian ethic is ascetic, and sainthood in all \nreligions is related to self-denial. \n\nThe year  marked a crisis in Gandhi\u2019s struggle with his \npassions. He had given up the house in Johannesburg, sent the \nfamily to Phoenix Farm, and volunteered for medical work in the \nZulu \u2018war\u2019. The suppression of the tribesmen, with its insensate \ncruelty of man to man, depressed him. The long treks to the \nhamlets of the suffering Negroes afforded ample opportunity for \nself-analysis; he must do more to make a better world. Also, he \nhad a premonition of further discriminatory measures against \nIndians in South Africa. He must dedicate himself completely to \npublic service. \n\nTo Gandhi, selfless service did not mean the sacrifice of part of \none\u2019s assets; it required the investment of all of one\u2019s being. A \ndedicated person could not belong to wife or children, for if he \ndid, then they and not the work would be the first consideration. \nTo lead others he had to be immune to all temptations and in \ncommand of all his desires. \n\nGandhi accordingly resolved to give up sexual intercourse. \nTwice before, he had tried to become continent. Kasturbai was \nwilling. They began to sleep in separate beds and he never retired \nuntil he was physically exhausted. Both times he succumbed to \ntemptation. \n\nThis time, however, he took a vow. \n\nOn his return from the Zulu uprising, Gandhi went to the \nfarm and told Kasturbai of his pledge to forswear sex. She made \nno protest. \u2018She was never the temptress,\u2019 Gandhi asserted; he \ndetermined the character of their intimate relations. \n\nGandhi remained celibate from , when he was thirty-seven, \nuntil his death in . \n\nThe Indian word for continence is \u2018Brahmacharya\u2019, and a \ncelibate man or woman is called a \u2018Brahmachari\u2019. Brahmacharya \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\u2018fully and properly understood\u2019, Gandhi wrote in , \u2018means \nsearch after Brahma*, or God. \u2018Brahmacharya\u2019, he added, \n\u2018signifies control of all the senses at all times and at all places in \nthought, word and deed.\u2019 It thus includes yet transcends sexual \nrestraint; it embraces restraint in diet, emotions and speech. It \nrules out hate, anger, violence and untruth. It creates equability. \nIt is desirelessness. \n\n\u2018Perfect Brahmacharis\u2019, Gandhi wrote, \u2018are perfectly sinless. \nThey are therefore near to God. They are like God.\u2019 To that he \naspired. It was the ultimate in self-transformation. \n\nIt is difficult to plumb Gandhi\u2019s motives; it was difficult even \nfor him to know them. Gandhi believed his celibacy was \u2018a \nresponse to the calls of public duty\u2019. On the other hand, \u2018My \nmain object was to escape having more children.\u2019 \n\nBut why avoid additional children? Phoenix Farm was one big \njoint family into which Gandhi invited many adults and children. \nTheir care was a common responsibility and expense. More of his \nown would not have increased the burden. \n\nKasturbai was anaemic. She was once near death from internal \nhaemorrhage. A gynaecological operation, performed without \nchloroform because she was too emaciated, brought relief but no \ncure. \n\nBrahmacharya is encountered frequently in Indian lore and life. \nBut it is unusual for a married man to take the vow at the early \nage at which Gandhi adopted it. Kasturbai\u2019s health and Hin\u00ac \nduism are part of the explanation. \u2018The sight of women\u2019, he \nadmitted in the Harijan magazine of June th, , \u2018had ceased \nto arouse any sexual urge in me in South Africa.\u2019 That was a third \nfactor. Perhaps, too, he harked back to his behaviour while his \nfather was dying. \n\nIn retrospect, Gandhi naturally did not attribute the chastity \nvow to his own physiology or to Kasturbai\u2019s, nor to his psychology. \nOn the contrary, he identified effect with motive and the effect was \nspiritual. The chaste life apparently reinforced his passion and de\u00ac \ntermination to sacrifice for the common weal. Less carnal, he became \nless self-centred. He seemed suddenly lifted above the material. A \nnew inner drive possessed him. Storms continued to rage within, \nbut now he could harness them for the generation of more power. \n\nA new Gandhi faced the South African government. \n\n \n\n\n \n\n",
    "1908-1912": " CHAPTER XI \n\n\nGANDHI GOES TO JAIL \n\n\n\nhere was nothing passive about Gandhi. He disliked the \n\n\nterm \u2018Passive Resistance  . Following the collective vow at \n\n\nX the Imperial Theatre, Gandhi offered a prize for a better \nname for this new kind of mass-yet-individual opposition to \ngovernment unfairness. \n\nMaganlal Gandhi, a second cousin of Gandhi who lived at \nPhoenix Farm, suggested \u2018Sadagraha  : \u2018firmness in a good cause  . \nGandhi amended it to \u2018Satyagraha  ; satya is truth, which equals \nlove and agraha is firmness or force. \u2018Satyagraha  , therefore, means \ntruth-force or love-force. Truth and love are attributes of the soul. \n\nThis became Gandhi\u2019s target: to be strong not with the strength \nof the brute but with the strength of the spark of God. \n\nSatyagraha, Gandhi said, is \u2018the vindication of truth not by \ninfliction of suffering on the opponent but on one\u2019s self  . That \nrequires self-control. The weapons of the Satyagrahi are within him. \n\nSatyagraha is peaceful. If words fail to convince the adversary \nperhaps purity, humility and honesty will. The opponent must \nbe \u2018weaned from error by patience and sympathy  , weaned, not \ncrushed; converted, not annihilated. \n\nSatyagraha is the exact opposite of the policy of an-eye-for-an- \neye-for-an-eye-for-an-eye which ends in making everybody blind. \n\nYou cannot inject new ideas into a man\u2019s head by chopping it \noff; neither will you infuse a new spirit into his heart by piercing \nit with a dagger. \n\nActs of violence create bitterness in the survivors and brutality \nin the destroyers; Satyagraha aims to exalt both sides. \n\nGandhi hoped that if he practised the Sermon on the Mount, \nSmuts would recall its precepts. Satyagraha assumes a constant \nbeneficent interaction between contestants with a view to their \nultimate reconciliation. Violence, insults and superheated \npropaganda obstruct this achievement. \n\nSeveral days after the spiritual baptism in Satyagraha at the \nImperial Theatre, the Transvaal government released Asiatic \n\n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\nwomen from the necessity of registration under the \u2018Black Act\u2019. \nThis may or may not have been a result of the new Indian \nmovement, but Indians felt encouraged by the success of Gandhi\u2019s \ntactics. \n\nBefore confronting the Government with Satyagraha, Gandhi \nthought it desirable to go to London. Transvaal was a Crown \nColony; the King could, on advice of his ministers, withhold royal \nassent from legislation. Accompanied by a Moslem soda water \nmanufacturer named H. O. Ali, Gandhi sailed for England. It \nwas his first visit since his shy law-student days. Now he was the \nvocal lobbyist. He interviewed Lord Elgin, the Secretary of \nState for the Colonies and Mr. John Morley, Secretary of State \nfor India and, like many champions of causes before and since, \naddressed a meeting of M.P.s in a committee room of the House \nof Commons. It gave Gandhi special pleasure to work with \nDadabhai Naoroji, \u2018The Grand Old Man of India\u2019. Dadabhai, \nas everybody called him, was president of the London Indian \nSociety for more than fifty years, a teacher of Gujarati in Univer\u00ac \nsity College, London, a past president of the Indian National \nCongress party, and on July th, , at the age of sixty-one, was \nelected to the British Parliament as the Liberal Member for \nCentral Finsbury by a majority of three votes. Before the poll, \nLord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister, had said, \u2018I doubt if \nwe have got to that point of view where a British constituency \nwould elect a black man.\u2019 The gibe gave Dadabhai his seat and \nfame. As a student in the Inner Temple, Gandhi once sat, \nreverent and silent, at the feet of Dadabhai. Now, autumn , \nGandhi and Dadabhai were associates in a political enterprise. \n\nThroughout the six weeks\u2019 sojourn, Englishmen assisted Gandhi \nin winning friends, arranging meetings, licking stamps, pasting \nenvelopes, etc. Their generous co-operation led him to remark \nthat \u2018benevolence is by no means peculiar to the brown skin\u2019. \n\nWhen the ship on which they were returning to South Africa \nstopped at the Portuguese island of Madeira, Gandhi and Ali \nreceived a cable from London announcing that Lord Elgin would \nnot sanction the Transvaal anti-Asiatic bill. In the next two weeks \non board ship, Gandhi and Ali were happy: they had won. \n\nIt transpired, however, that Lord Elgin had employed a \n\u2018trick\u2019. He had told the Transvaal Commissioner in London that \n\n\n \n\n\nGANDHI GOES TO JAIL \n\nthe King would disallow the registration ordinance. But since the \nTransvaal would cease to be a Crown Colony on January ist, \n, it could then re-enact the ordinance without royal approval. \nGandhi condemned this as a \u2018crooked policy\u2019. \n\nIn due course, Transvaal set up responsible government and \nadopted the Asiatic Registration Act to go into effect on July st, \n. Indians stigmatized it as the \u2018Black Act\u2019, morally black, \naimed at black, brown and yellow men. Gandhi, who was light \nbrown, often referred to himself as \u2018black\u2019. \n\nGandhi confidently told the Indian community that \u2018even a \ncrooked policy would in time turn straight if only we are true to \nourselves\u2019. The Indians prepared to offer Satyagraha. Uneasy, \nPrime Minister General Botha sent them a message saying he \n\u2018was helpless\u2019; the white population insisted on the legislation. \nTherefore the Government would be firm. \n\nSo would the Indians. One Moslem, Ahmad Mohammed \nKachhalia, apparently speaking for many Satyagrahis, said, \u2018I \nswear in the name of God that I will be hanged but I will not \nsubmit to this law.\u2019 \n\nSome Indians took out permits under the Act, but most did not. \nA number of Indians were accordingly served with official notices \nto register or leave the Transvaal. Failing to do either, they were \nbrought before a magistrate on January nth, . Gandhi was \namong them. He had attended the same court as a lawyer. Now \nhe stood in the dock. Respectfully he told the judge that as leader \nhe merited the heaviest sentence. Judge Jordan unobligingly gave \nhim only two months\u2019 simple imprisonment \u2018without hard labour\u2019. \n\nIt was Gandhi\u2019s first term in jail. \n\nGandhi recorded this jail experience in an article printed at the \ntime. The prison authorities were friendly, the meals bad, the \ncells over-crowded. Gandhi went in with four other Satyagrahis. \nFrom notes kept in prison with his customary meticulousness, he \nknew how many joined them each day and the figures are \nreproduced in the published account. By January th, their \nnumber had risen to . \n\nGandhi read the Gita in the morning and the Koran , in English \ntranslation, at noon. He used the Bible to teach English to a \nChinese Christian fellow prisoner. He also read Ruskin, Socrates, \nTolstoy, Huxley, Bacon\u2019s essays and Carlyle\u2019s Lives . He was \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\nhappy; he believed that \u2018whoever has a taste for reading good \nbooks is able to bear loneliness in any place with great ease\u2019. \nIndeed, he seemed to regret that his sentence was so short for he \nhad commenced to do a Gujarati translation of a book by Carlyle \nand of Ruskin\u2019s Unto This Last , and: \u2018I would not have become \ntired even if I had got more than two months.  \n\nReading and translating were interrupted by a visitor from the \noutside; he was Albert Cartwright, editor of the Johannesburg \nTransvaal Leader and a friend of Gandhi; he came as an emissary \nfrom General Jan Christian Smuts. Cartwright brought a com\u00ac \npromise solution drafted by Smuts. \n\nSmuts\u2019s proposal required the Indians to register voluntarily. \nThen the \u2018Black Act  would be repealed. \n\nOn January th, the Johannesburg Chief of Police came to the \njail and personally conducted Gandhi to Pretoria for a meeting \nwith Smuts. The prisoner, in prison uniform, and the general had \na long talk. Gandhi wanted assurances of the repeal and he \nstipulated that public mention be made of the Indians  resistance. \n\nSmuts said, \u2018I could never entertain a dislike for your people. \nYou know I too am a barrister. I had some Indian fellow students \nin my time. But I must do my duty. The Europeans want this \nlaw ... I accept the alterations you have suggested in the draft. \nI have consulted General Botha and I assure you that I will repeal \nthe Asiatic Act as soon as most of you have undergone voluntary \nregistration.  \n\nSmuts rose. \n\n\u2018Where am I to go?  Gandhi asked. \n\n\u2018You are free this very moment.  \n\n\u2018What about the other prisoners?  Gandhi asked. \n\n\u2018I am phoning the prison officials to release the other prisoners \ntomorrow morning.  \n\nIt was evening and Gandhi did not have a copper in his pockets. \nSmuts\u2019s secretary gave him the fare to Johannesburg. \n\nIn Johannesburg Gandhi encountered stormy opposition. \u2018Why \nwas not the Act repealed first, before registration?  Indians \ndemanded at a public meeting. \n\n\u2018That would not be in the nature of a compromise,  Gandhi replied. \n\n\u2018What if General Smuts breaks faith with us?  they argued. \n\n\u2018A Satyagrahi,  Gandhi said, \u2018bids goodbye to fear. He is \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI GOES TO JAIL \n\ntherefore never afraid of trusting the opponent. Even if the \nopponent plays him false twenty times, the Satyagrahi is ready \nto trust him for the twenty-first time \u2014 for an implicit trust in \nhuman nature is the very essence of his creed.\u2019 \n\nOptimism about human nature was the starting post of all \nGandhi\u2019s activities; it sometimes made him sound naive. His \noptimism sprang from a belief that \u2018man can change his tempera\u00ac \nment, can control it\u2019 although he \u2018cannot eradicate it. God has \ngiven him no such liberty\u2019. Change and control, therefore, \nrequire constant effort. \n\nSmuts had made the point that unless Indians in the Transvaal \nregistered, there would be no check on Indian immigration, and \nthe State might be inundated with unwanted Asiatics. Gandhi \naccepted this and told the public meeting that voluntary registra\u00ac \ntion would indicate that \u2018we do not intend to bring a single Indian \ninto the Transvaal surreptitiously or by fraud\u2019. \n\nGandhi took into consideration the pressure on the Government \nfrom race-prejudiced whites. Therefore he was ready to accept \nvoluntary registration. But he objected to compulsory registration \nby statute because a government must treat all citizens equally. \nHe did not want Indians to bow to force: that reduced the dignity \nand stature of individuals. On the other hand, Gandhi explained \nto the meeting, collaboration freely given \u2014 in view of the \nopponent\u2019s known difficulties \u2014 was generous and hence en\u00ac \nnobling. Smuts had withdrawn the compulsion from registration; \nthat changed the entire situation. \n\nA giant Pathan from the wild mountains of north-west India \nnear the Khyber Pass stood up and said, \u2018We have heard that \nyou have betrayed the community and sold it to General Smuts \nfor fifteen thousand pounds. We will never give the fingerprints \nnor allow others to do so. I swear with Allah as my witness that \nI will kill the man who takes the lead in applying for registration.\u2019 \n\nGandhi\u2019s book on Satyagraha records this charge for posterity. \nHe defended himself against it, and declared, despite the threat, \nthat he would be the first to give his fingerprints. Then he added, \n\u2018Death is the appointed end of all life. To die by the hand of a \nbrother, rather than by disease or in such other way, cannot be \nfor me a matter of sorrow. And if, even in such a case, I am free \nfrom the thought of anger or hatred against my assailant, I know \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\nthat that will redound to my eternal welfare, and even the assailant \nwill later on realize my perfect innocence/ The audience listened \nin silence; it could not have foreseen a nearly fatal assault in the \nimmediate future or the death of Gandhi, forty years later, at the \nhands of a brother. \n\nGandhi arranged to register on February ioth, the first to do \nso. He went to his law office in the morning as usual. Outside \nhe saw a group of big Pathans. Among them was Mir Alam, a \nclient of Gandhi\u2019s, six feet tall and of powerful build. Gandhi \ngreeted the Pathans, but their response was ominously cold. \n\nAfter a little while, Gandhi and several companions left the \noffice and commenced walking to the registration bureau. The \nPathans followed close behind. Just before Gandhi had reached \nhis destination, Mir Alam stepped forward and said, \u2018Where are \nyou going?\u2019 \n\n\u2018I propose to take out a certificate of registration,\u2019 Gandhi replied. \n\nBefore he could finish the explanation a heavy blow struck \nGandhi on the top of his head. \u2018I at once fainted with the words \n\u201cHey, Rama\u201d (Oh, God) on my lips,\u2019 reads his own account. \nThose were his last words on January th, , the day he died. \n\nOther blows fell on Gandhi as he lay on the ground; and the \nPathans kicked him for good measure. \n\nHe was carried into an office. When he regained consciousness, \nthe Reverend Joseph J. Doke, a bearded Baptist idealist, was \nbending over him. \u2018How do you feel?\u2019 said Doke. \n\n\u2018I am all right,\u2019 Gandhi answered, \u2018but I have pains in the teeth \nand ribs. Where is Mir Alam?\u2019 \n\n\u2018He has been arrested with the other Pathans,\u2019 Doke said. \n\n\u2018They should be released,\u2019 Gandhi murmured. \u2018They thought \nthey were doing right, and I have no desire to prosecute them.\u2019 \n\nGandhi was taken to the Doke home, and the wounds in his \ncheek and lip were stitched. He asked that Mr. Chamney, the \nRegistrar for Asiatics, be brought to him so that he could give his \nfingerprints without delay. The process hurt Gandhi physically; \nevery movement was painful. Chamney began to weep. \u2018I had \noften to write bitterly against him,\u2019 Gandhi declared, \u2018but this \nshowed me how man\u2019s heart may be softened by events.\u2019 \n\nGandhi remained under the tender care of the \u2018godly family\u2019 \nfor ten days. Several times, Gandhi, feeling the need of comfort, \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI GOES TO JAIL \n\nasked Olive, the little Doke daughter, to sing \u2018Lead, Kindly \nLight\u2019. It was one of his favourite Christian hymns. \n\nAfter recovering, Gandhi indefatigably preached loyalty to his \nregistration settlement. Kasturbai and the boys had worried about \nhim after Mir Alam\u2019s attack; Gandhi visited them at Phoenix Farm \nand spent most of the time there writing for Indian Opinion in ex\u00ac \nplanation of his compromise with Smuts for voluntary finger\u00ac \nprinting. Many Indians followed Gandhi without really agreeing, \nand he tried to convince them. \n\nWhat was Gandhi\u2019s embarrassment, therefore, when Smuts \nrefused to fulfil his promise to repeal the \u2018Black Act\u2019. Instead, \nSmuts offered the legislature a bill which validated the voluntary \ncertificates but kept the compulsory-registration law. \n\n\u2018There you are,\u2019 the Indians taunted Gandhi. \u2018We have been \ntelling you that you are very credulous.\u2019 \n\nIn a charitable and objective mood two decades later, when \nSatyagraha in South Africa was published, Gandhi asserted, \u2018It is \nquite possible that in behaving to the Indians as he did in , \nGeneral Smuts was not guilty of a deliberate breach of faith.\u2019 \nBut in the heat of the battle, in , Gandhi contributed articles \nto Indian Opinion under the caption, \u2018Foul Play\u2019, and called Smuts \na \u2018heartless man\u2019. \n\nThe Indian community\u2019s temper gradually rose to fever pitch. \nA meeting was called at the Hamidia Mosque in Johannesburg \nfor four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, August th, . A large iron \ncauldron resting on four curved legs was placed conspicuously on \na raised platform. \n\nThe speeches finished, more than two thousand registration \ncertificates collected from the spectators were thrown into the \ncauldron and burned in paraffin as a mighty cheer went up from \nthe brown throng. The London Daily Mail correspondent in \nJohannesburg compared it with the Boston Tea Party. \n\nThe issue between the Indians and the Government was now \njoined. \n\nUnder the Smuts-Gandhi compromise, most of the permanent \nresidents registered voluntarily. Thereafter, any Indian dis\u00ac \ncovered without a registration certificate would be subject to \ndeportation as a new, illegal entrant. The compromise thus stopped- \nimmigration, and that was the original purpose of the \u2018Black Act\u2019. \n\ng m.g.  \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nThen why did Smuts now reintroduce compulsory registration? \n'To insult us,  the Indians said. e To stress our inequality. To \nforce us to admit our inferiority.  \n\nThis, Gandhi declared, is one of the virtues of Satyagraha: it \nuncovers concealed motives and reveals the truth. It puts the \nbest possible interpretation on the opponent\u2019s intentions and \nthereby gives him another chance to discard baser impulses. If \nhe fails to do so, his victims see more clearly and feel more \nintensely, while outsiders realize who is wrong. \n\nThe Indians now decided not to register under compulsion and \nto defy the ban on immigration into the Transvaal. \n\nFor the impending contest with the government of the Trans\u00ac \nvaal, Gandhi commenced to muster his resources. His law office \nat the corner of Rissik and Anderson Streets in Johannesburg \nhad now been converted, largely, into a Satyagraha headquarters. \nIt consisted of two small and meagrely furnished rooms, an outer \none for a secretary and an inner one where Gandhi worked \namidst photographs of his ambulance unit, of Mrs. Annie Besant, \nand some Indian leaders, and a picture of Jesus. Gandhi also \nhad an office at Phoenix Farm, and he spent more time there \nthan before because he needed the support of the Natal Indians \nwho far outnumbered the thirteen thousand of the Transvaal. At \nthe farm, he led a chaste, frugal, Spartan existence. Except when \nit rained he slept in the open on a thin cloth. He eschewed all \nmaterial pleasures, and concentrated on the coming battle. \u2018A \nSatyagrahi,\u2019 he said, 'has to be, if possible, even more single- \nminded than a rope dancer.  \n\nTo the Johannesburg office and Phoenix Farm came a steady \nstream of Indians and whites. Gandhi\u2019s circle of friends was large; \nhe attracted people and they usually remained loyal to him. \n\nOlive Schreiner, author of The Story of an African Farm and \nDreams , was one of Gandhi\u2019s best friends in Cape Colony. \n'Love was written in her eyes,\u2019 he said. Though she came of a \nrich, distinguished and learned family, \u2018she was so simple in \nhabits that she cleansed utensils in her house herself\u2019, and did her \nown cooking and sweeping. \u2018Such physical labour,\u2019 Gandhi held, \n'stimulated her literary ability.\u2019 Colour prejudice was repugnant \nto her. She lent her great influence in South Africa to the cause \nof fairness-to-Indians. So did her brother, Senator W. P. \n\n\nioo \n\n\nGANDHI GOES TO JAIL \n\nSchreiner, the Attorney-General and, at one time, the Prime \nMinister of the Colony. Other prominent persons and high \nofficials openly aided Gandhi\u2019s movement. Many Christian \nclergymen supported him. They saw Satyagraha as Christianity \nin action against a system that merely called itself Christian. \nGandhi worked through moral conversion. He preferred it to \nphysical coercion and even to moral coercion. No true devotee of \nChrist could resist this. Christian editors, idealists and ministers \natoned for the white man\u2019s sins by helping the little brown Hindu. \n\nOf all Gandhi\u2019s South African collaborators \u2014 Indian or white \n\u2014 the most intimate, he said, were Henry S. L. Polak, Herman \nKallenbach, an extremely wealthy Johannesburg architect, and \nSonya Schlesin, who came from Scotland. \n\nKallenbach was a tall, thick-set, squareheaded German Jew \nwith a long handlebar moustache and pince-nez. He met Gandhi \nby chance; a mutual interest in Buddhism brought them closer \ntogether, and thereafter, until Gandhi returned to India, they \nwere inseparable. If anybody can be called Gandhi\u2019s second-in- \ncommand of the Satyagraha movement it was Kallenbach. \nGandhi characterized him as \u2018a man of strong feelings, wide \nsympathies, and child-like simplicity\u2019. \n\nWhen Gandhi needed a private secretary and typist Kallenbach \nrecommended Miss Schlesin, who was of Russian-Jewish origin. \nGandhi thought her \u2018noble\u2019 and the finest person among his \nEuropean associates. She wore boyish-bobbed hair and a collar \nand necktie. She never married. Though she was young, Indian \nleaders went to her for advice, and the Reverend Doke, when \nhe ran Indian Opinion , liked her to comment on his editorials. \nGandhi put her in charge of Satyagraha\u2019s treasury and books. \n\nFor the financing of the resistance movement, Indians and \nEuropeans in South Africa and Indians in India contributed con\u00ac \nsiderable sums. Gandhi believed that an organization whose \ncause is just and impersonal, and which operates in full public \nview, will not lack money. He likewise believed in rigidly \neconomical spending and scrupulous, detailed accounting. \n\nSuggestions poured in on Gandhi to raise the entire question of \nIndian disabilities in South Africa and to mobilize the whole \nIndian community of the continent. But he decided that it was \nagainst the principles of Satyagraha to expand or even to shift \n\nIOI \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\none\u2019s goal in the midst of battle. The issue was the right of Indians \nto live in and enter the Transvaal, nothing else. \n\nGandhi now made a move of arresting and dramatic simplicity. \nA Parsi Indian from Natal named Sorabji Shapurji Adajania, \nwho spoke English and had never visited the Transvaal, was \nchosen, at his own request, to test the bar on immigrants. He was \nto notify the Government of his intentions, present himself at the \nTransvaal frontier station of Volksrust, and court arrest. But the \nborder authorities let him in and he proceeded unmolested to \nJohannesburg. \n\nWhen their astonishment subsided, the Indians interpreted this \ndevelopment as a triumph; the Government had refused to fight. \nEven when Sorabji was sentenced to a month\u2019s imprisonment for \nnot leaving the Transvaal, their enthusiasm for the Gandhi \nmethod remained strong. It was accordingly decided that a \nnumber of English-speaking Indians in Natal, including Harilal, \nGandhi\u2019s eldest son, who had returned from India, should enter \nthe Transvaal. They were arrested at Volksrust and given three \nmonths in jail. \u2018The Transvaal Indians\u2019, Gandhi comments, \n\u2018were now in high spirits . . . The movement was now in full \nswing.\u2019 The movement fed on prison sentences. \n\nGandhi was besieged by people seeking permission to be \narrested. He gratified the wish of some Natal Indians. Transvaal \nIndians applied for the same privilege; they had only to tell the \npolice that they had no registration certificates. \n\nGandhi too was arrested and confined in the Volksrust prison. \nHis prison card has been preserved by Manilal. It is cream- \ncoloured and two and seven-eighths inches wide by three and one- \neighth. His name is mistakenly given as \u2018M. S. Gandhi\u2019 instead \nof M. K. Gandhi. \u2018Trade: Solicitor.\u2019 No alias. \u2018Sentence and \ndate: Twenty-five pounds or two months. October ioth, .\u2019 \n(Like all other Indians, Gandhi preferred prison to fines.) \u2018Due \nfor discharge: December th, .\u2019 On the reverse side, under \n\u2018Prison Offences\u2019, is a blank. He was a model prisoner. \n\nGandhi had seventy-five compatriots with him in jail, and he \nbecame their cook. \u2018Thanks to their love for me\u2019, he wrote in a \ncontemporary article, \u2018my companions took without a murmur \nthe half-cooked porridge I prepared without sugar.\u2019 In addition \nhe performed hard labour \u2014 digging the earth with a shovel\u2014 \n\n\n \n\n\nGANDHI GOES TO JAIL \n\nwhich blistered his hands. The blisters opened and caused pain. \n\nOnce the warden wanted two men to clean the latrines. Gandhi \nvolunteered. \n\nHe had brought this suffering on himself and, by his agitation, \non others. Would it not be better to pay the fine and stay at home? \n\n\u2018Such thoughts\u2019, Gandhi asserted, \u2018make one really a coward.\u2019 \nBesides, jail has its good sides: only one warden, whereas in the \nfree life there are many; no worry about food; work keeps the \nbody healthy; no \u2018vicious habits\u2019; \u2018the prisoner\u2019s soul is thus free\u2019 \nand he has time to pray to God. \u2018The real road to happiness\u2019, \nGandhi proclaimed, \u2018lies in going to jail and undergoing sufferings \nand privations there in the interest of one\u2019s country and religion\u2019. \n\nThis account of life and reflections in jail ends with a quotation \nfrom Thoreau\u2019s famous essay on \u2018Civil Disobedience\u2019 which \nGandhi had borrowed from the prison library. \u2018I saw\u2019 Thoreau \nwrote, \u2018that if there was a wall of stone between me and my \ntownsmen, there was a still more difficult one to climb or break \nthrough before they could get to be as free as I was. I did not \nfeel for a moment confined, and the walls seemed a great waste of \nstone and mortar. . . . \n\n\u2018As they could not reach me\u2019, Thoreau continued, \u2018they had \nresolved to punish my body ... I saw that the state was half\u00ac \nwitted, that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons, \nand that it did not know its friends from its foes, and I lost all my \nremaining respect for it and pitied it.\u2019 \n\nGandhi cherished this excerpt from Thoreau. He studied the \nentire essay. \n\nIt has often been said that Gandhi took the idea of Satyagraha \nfrom Thoreau. Gandhi denied this in a letter, dated September \nioth, , and addressed to Mr. P. Kodanda Rao of the Servants \nof India Society; Gandhi wrote, \u2018The statement that I had derived \nmy idea of Civil Disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is \nwrong. The resistance to authority in South Africa was well \nadvanced before I got the essay of Thoreau on Civil Disobedience. \nBut the movement was then known as passive resistance. As it \nwas incomplete I had coined the word Satyagraha for the Gujarati \nreaders. When I saw the title of Thoreau\u2019s great essay, I began \nto use his phrase to explain our struggle to the English readers. \nBut I found that even \u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d failed to convey the \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nfull meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase Civil \nResistance.\u2019 \n\nNevertheless, Thoreau\u2019s \u2018Civil Disobedience\u2019 essay did influence \nGandhi; he called it a \u2018masterly treatise\u2019; \u2018it left a deep impression \non me\u2019, he affirmed. There is the imprint of Thoreau on much that \nGandhi did. Thoreau had read the Bhagavad Gita and some of the \nsacred Hindu Upanishads ; so had Ralph Waldo Emerson who was \nThoreau\u2019s friend and frequent host. Thoreau, the New England \nrebel, borrowed from distant India and repaid the debt by throw\u00ac \ning ideas into the world pool of thought; ripples reached the \nIndian lawyer-politician in South Africa. \n\nHenry David Thoreau, poet and essayist, was born in  and \ndied of tuberculosis at the age of forty-five. He hated Negro \nslavery and the individual\u2019s slavery to the Church, the State, pro\u00ac \nperty, customs and traditions. With his own hands he built him\u00ac \nself a hut at Walden Pond outside Concord, Massachusetts, and \ndwelt there alone, doing all the work, growing his food and enjoy\u00ac \ning full contact with nature. \n\nTwo years at Walden proved to Thoreau\u2019s own satisfaction that \nhe had the courage and inner strength to be free in isolation. He \naccordingly returned to Concord to discover whether he could be \nfree inside the community. He decided that the least he could do \nwas \u2018not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn\u2019. So he refused \nto pay taxes and was imprisoned. A friend paid the tax for him, \nand Thoreau came out after twenty-four hours, but the ex\u00ac \nperience evoked his most provoking political essay, \u2018Civil Dis\u00ac \nobedience\u2019. \n\n\u2018The only obligation which I have a right to assume\u2019 Thoreau \ndeclared in \u2018Civil Disobedience\u2019, \u2018is to do at any time what I \nthink right.\u2019 To be right, he insisted, is more honourable than \nto be law-abiding. \n\nThoreau democracy was the cult of the minority. \u2018Why does \n[the Government] not cherish its wise minority?\u2019 he cried. \u2018Why \ndoes it always crucify Christ?\u2019 \n\nIt was . Thoreau was thinking of Negro slavery and the \ninvasion of Mexico. The majority which tolerated these measures \nwas wrong, and he was right. Could he obey a government that \ncommitted such sins? He held that dissent without disobedience \nwas consent and therefore culpable. \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI GOES TO JAIL \n\nThoreau described civil disobedience in exact terms, as Gandhi \nunderstood it: T know this well,  Thoreau wrote, \u2018that if one \nthousand, if one hundred, if ten men whom I could name \u2014 if ten \nhonest men only \u2014 ay, if one honest man, in this state of Massa\u00ac \nchusetts, ceasing to hold slaves , were actually to withdraw from this \ncopartnership, and be locked up in the county jail therefor, it \nwould be the abolition of slavery in America. For it matters not \nhow small the beginning may seem to be: what is once well done \nis done forever. But we love better to talk about it. . . . \n\n\u2018There are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and \nwar, who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them,\u2019 Thoreau \ncontinued. \u2018There, are nine hundred and ninety-nine patrons of \nvirtue to every virtuous man.  Thoreau despised professions \nwithout actions. He asked, \u2018How does it become a man to behave \ntowards this American government today? I answer, that he can\u00ac \nnot without disgrace be associated with it.\u2019 His programme was \n\u2018peaceful revolution\u2019. \u2018All men recognize the right to revolution,\u2019 \nhe wrote, \u2018that is, the right to refuse allegiance to, and to resist, \nthe government when its tyranny and efficiency are great and \nunendurable.\u2019 \n\nThis is why Gandhi was in jail at the very moment he read \u2018Civil \nDisobedience\u2019. \n\nLike Ruskin, Thoreau sought a closer correspondence between \nman\u2019s acts and man\u2019s goal. The artist in both required the \nintegration of word and faith with deed. The great poet, the great \nartist has integrity. \n\nMillions had read Ruskin and Thoreau and agreed with them. \nMany Hindus had read them and agreed with them. But Gandhi \ntook words and ideas seriously, and when he accepted an idea in \nprinciple he felt that not to practise it was dishonest. How can \nyou believe in a moral or religious precept and not live it? \n\nThe gulf between word and belief is untruth. The dissonance \nbetween creed and deed is the root of innumerable wrongs in our \ncivilization; it is the weakness of all churches, states, parties and \npersons. It gives institutions and men split personalities. \n\nIn attempting to establish a harmony between words, beliefs \nand acts Gandhi was attacking man\u2019s central problem. He was \nseeking the formula for mental health. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER XII \n\n\nLETTER TO A SON \n\nG andhi\u2019s second sentence ended on December th, , \nbut, since civil resistance against the immigration ban con\u00ac \ntinued, he received a third three-month sentence and was \nback in Volksrust prison on February th, . Five days later, \ncarrying a few possessions on his head and walking in heavy rain, \nhe was escorted to a train for Pretoria where he sat out his term \nin the newly built local penitentiary. On arriving, the warden \nsaid, \u2018Are you the son of Gandhi?\u2019 He apparently looked so \nyouthful that the official mistook him for his son Harilal who was \nserving a six-month period in Volksrust. Gandhi was forty. \n\nIn jail, Gandhi received a gift of two religious books from \nGeneral Smuts; he also read Stevenson\u2019s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, \nCarlyle\u2019s French Revolution , and many Indian religious volumes. \n\u2018My books saved me,\u2019 he wrote in his reminiscences. \n\nFrom prison, Gandhi sent a letter to Manilal who has preserved \nit to this day. It was written by hand, with purple indelible ink \npencil, on both sides of five long cream-coloured foolscap sheets \nof prison stationery and is in English. Normally, Gandhi would \nhave addressed Manilal in Gujarati, but printed instructions in \nthe left-hand margin of each page say, in English, Dutch and \nKaffir, that correspondence must be conducted in English, \nDutch, German, French, or Kaffir. The letter is dated March \nth, ; Gandhi\u2019s number was ; the censor initialled it two \ndays later. \n\nManilal was seventeen and, since nobody else worried, he \nworried about his profession and future. He had had practically \nno formal education. Now he was his father\u2019s agent on the farm \nand in Indian Opinion , and probably a very harassed young man. \n\nMy dear son [Gandhi began], I have a right to write one \nletter per month and receive also one letter per month. It became \na question with me as to whom I should write to. I thought of \nMr. Ritch [the editor of Indian Opinion ], Mr. Polak and you. I \n\n \n\n\nLETTER TO A SON \n\n\nchose you because you have been nearest my thoughts in all my \nreading. \n\nAs for myself I must not, I am not allowed to say much. I am \nquite at peace & none need worry about me. \n\nI hope mother is now quite well. I know several letters from \nyou have been received but they have not been given to me. The \nDeputy Governor however was good enough to tell me that she \nwas getting on well. Does she wall: about freely? I hope she and \nall of you would continue to take sago & milk in the morning. \nAnd how is Chanchi? [The nickname of Harilal\u2019s wife, Gulab.] \nTell her I think of her every day. I hope she has got rid of all \nthe sores she had and that she & Rami [Harilal\u2019s little daughter] \nare quite well. \n\nI hope Ramdas and Devadas are keeping well, learning their \nlessons and not causing any worry. Has Ramdas got rid of his \ncough? \n\nI hope you all treated Willie well while he was with you. Any \nbalance of the food stuff left by Mr. Cordes I should wish you \nhave returned to him. \n\nAnd now about yourself. How are you? Although I think that \nyou are well able to bear all the burden I have placed on your \nshoulders and that you are doing it quite cheerfully, I have often \nfelt that you required greater personal guidance than I have been \nable to give you. I know too that you have sometimes felt that \nyour education was being neglected. Now I have read a great \ndeal in the prison. I have been reading Emerson, Ruskin and \nMazzini. I have also been reading the Upanishads. All confirm \nthe view that education does not mean a knowledge of letters \nbut it means character building. It means a knowledge of duty. \nOur own [Gujarati] word literally means training. If this is the \ntrue view, and it is to my mind the only true view, you are \nreceiving the best education-training possible. What can be \nbetter than that you should have the opportunity of nursing \nmother & cheerfully bearing her ill temper, or than looking after \nChanchi & anticipating her wants and behaving to her so as \nnot to make her feel the absence of Harilal or again than being \nguardian to Ramdas and Devadas? If you succeed in doing this \nwell, you have received more than half your education. \n\nI was much struck by one passage in Nathuramji\u2019s introduction \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nto the Upanishads . He says that the Brahmacharya stage \u2014 i.e., \nthe first stage, is like the last, i.e., the sanyasin [monk] stage. This \nis true. Amusement only continues during the age of innocence, \ni.e., up to twelve years only. As soon as a boy reaches the age of \ndiscretion, he is taught to realize his responsibilities. Every boy \nfrom such age onward should practise continence in thought & \ndeed, truth likewise and the not-taking of any life. This to him \nmust not be an irksome learning and practice but it should be \nnatural to him. It should be his enjoyment. I can recall to my \nmind several such boys in Rajkot. Let me tell you that when I \nwas younger than you are my keenest enjoyment was to nurse my \nfather. Of amusement after I was twelve, I had little or none. If \nyou practise the three virtues, if they become part of your life, \nso far as I am concerned you will have completed your education \n\u2014 your training. Armed with them, believe me you will earn your \nbread in any part of the world & you will have paved the way to \nacquire a true knowledge of the soul, yourself and God. This does \nnot mean that you shd not receive instruction in letters. That \nyou shd & you are doing. But it is a thing over which you need \nnot fret yourself. You have plenty of time for it and after all you \nare to receive such instruction in order that your training may be \nof use to others. \n\nRemember please that henceforth our lot is poverty. The more \nI think of it the more I feel that it is more blessed to be poor than \nto be rich. The uses of poverty are far sweeter than those of riches. \n\nThere follow one hundred and five lines of instructions, mes\u00ac \nsages, and greetings to persons at Phoenix Farm, then, \n\nAnd now again yourself. Do give ample work to gardening, \nactual digging, hoeing, etc. We have to live upon it in future. \nAnd you shd be the expert gardener of the family. Keep your \ntools in their respective places and absolutely clean. In your \nlessons you shd give a great deal of attention to mathematics and \nSanskrit. The latter is absolutely necessary for you. Both these \nstudies are difficult in after life. You will not neglect your music. \nYou shd make a selection of all good passages, hymns and verses, \nwhether in English, Gujarati or Hindi and write them out in \nyour best hand in a book. The collection at the end of a year \n\n \n\n\nLETTER TO A SON \n\n\nwill be most valuable. All these things you can do easily if you \nare methodical. Never get agitated and think you have too much \nto do and then worry over what to do first. This you will find out \nin practice if you are patient and take care of your minutes. I \nhope you are keeping an accurate account as it should be kept of \nevery penny spent for the household. \n\nThe next paragraph is for a student at the farm. Continuing, \nGandhi writes: \n\nPlease tell Maganlalbhai that I would advise him to read Emer\u00ac \nson\u2019s essays. They can be had for nine pence in Durham. There \nis a cheap reprint out. These essays are worth studying. He shd \nread them, mark the important passages and then finally copy \nthem out in a notebook. The essays to my mind contain the \nteaching of Indian wisdom in a western guru. It is interesting to \nsee our own sometimes thus differently fashioned. He should also \ntry to read Tolstoy\u2019s Kingdom of God is Within You. It is a most \nlogical book. The English of the translation is very simple. What \nis more Tolstoy practises what he preaches. \n\nGandhi told Manilal to make copies of this letter and send one \nto Polak, another to Kallenbach, and a third to a swami who had \nleft for India. He was to wait for Polak\u2019s and Kallenbach\u2019s replies \nand incorporate them into his own which, however, \u2018should not \ncontain any information about the struggle\u2019. The censor did not \nallow that. \n\nIn the last breath Gandhi asked for \u2018a copy of algebra. Any \nedition will do\u2019. \n\nAnd now I close with love to all and kisses to Ramdas, Devadas \n& Rami. \n\nfrom \n\nFather. \n\nSolicitude in the writer may be irritation to the recipient. \nGandhi\u2019s warm and tender concern to mould Manilal into his \nown image probably sounded like a sermon interlarded with \ncountless obnoxious chores. Gandhi\u2019s selfless injunctions were \nfor his son\u2019s good, but the prospect of chastity, poverty and hard \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nwork under a strict taskmaster who wanted the tools stacked \nneatly in the storeroom offered few thrills to the young man on \nthe threshold of life. \n\nMarried at thirteen, Gandhi never had a boyhood and therefore \nnever understood his own boys. The letter to Manilal showed \nthis. As a blueprint of the future it had the virtue of truth, but \nthe truth was forbidding. The fact that his father had not enjoyed \nlife from the age of twelve would have saddened a sensitive son or, \nindeed, frightened him. Such a father is difficult to live with. \nSuch a father writes such a letter. The letter said, in effect, \u2018Your \nlife will remain tied to mine; you cannot go your own way.  \nGandhi wanted a helper; Manilal wanted freedom. He thought \nof becoming a lawyer or doctor. His father was training him to \nbe a minor saint. \n\nEyes fixed on a distant, glorious goal, Gandhi, at this stage, \nsometimes failed to see those who were nearest. He expected them \nto meet the exacting standards he cheerfully imposed on himself. \nBut he was not cruel; very likely, it never occurred to him that \nhis letter conveyed anything but deep love and paternal care. \n\n\ni io \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER XIV \n\n\nTHE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME \n\nGandhi never despaired of the worst reprobate. During the \nSouth African struggle, Gandhi learned that one of his close \nIndian associates was a government informer. Later the \nman openly opposed Gandhi, yet when he became ill and impe\u00ac \ncunious Gandhi visited him and gave him financial aid. In time, \nthe backslider repented. \n\nIt was not easy for Gandhi to hold his followers. Government \npunitive measures caused many Satyagrahis to abandon the \nmovement. Some resisters were deported to India with loss of \nproperty. Satyagraha put even the strongest character to a \nwithering test. At one time, of the thirteen thousand Indians in the \nTransvaal, twenty-five hundred were in jail and six thousand had \nfled the province. Only as self-abnegating, high-minded, deter\u00ac \nmined and indefatigable a leader as Gandhi could have kept the \nmovement alive. The worst setbacks did not shake his faith in \nvictory. This faith, plus the fact that in and out of jail he shared \nhis followers\u2019 hardships and thereby won their love, was the bind\u00ac \ning cement of the loyal band which at times dwindled alarmingly. \nSome resisters served five prison terms in quick succession, court\u00ac \ning a new sentence the moment they finished the old one. They \nmerely left the Transvaal for Natal and immediately crossed into the \nTransvaal again. That, under the immigration ban, was their crime. \n\nPresently, a bigger danger loomed: a federal Union of South \nAfrica was projected; it might, probably would, enact anti-Indian \nlegislation like that of the Transvaal. Gandhi decided to lobby \nin London. Generals Botha and Smuts were already there making \narrangements for the creation of the Union. \n\nGandhi always set his sights high. This time he won the active \nsupport of Lord Ampthill, former Governor of Madras and acting \nViceroy of India in . From his arrival in England on July \nth, , until his return to South Africa in November, Gandhi \nmet editors, M.P.s, officials and private citizens of all races; his \nfervour fascinated and infected many of them. \n\n \n\n\nTHE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME \n\nLiberal Englishmen regretted overt colour discrimination in \nan empire overwhelmingly non-white. Imperialistic Englishmen \nwere concerned with the effects of South African and anti-Indian \nlegislation on India. While Gandhi worked in England, Henry \nPolak was in India explaining the Transvaal situation and stirring \nprotests which echoed in Whitehall. The British government in \nLondon tried to reconcile the differences between Smuts and \nGandhi; but the general yielded too little. Smuts was ready to \nrepeal the compulsory registration act and permit the immigration \ninto the Transvaal of a limited number of English-speaking, \neducated, professional Indians to serve the Indian community. \n\nGandhi, however, asked for the removal of the \u2018badge of inferior\u00ac \nity\u2019 and the \u2018implied racial taint\u2019; he wanted \u2018legal or theoretical \nequality in respect of immigration\u2019. Small material concessions \nneither impressed nor mollified him. When, therefore, Lord \nCrewe, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, informed \nGandhi in writing that \u2018Mr. Smuts was unable to accept the \nclaim that Asiatics should be placed in a position of equality with \nEuropeans in respect of right of entry or otherwise\u2019, the militant \nbarrister, admitting defeat in diplomatic negotiation, foresaw a \nrenewal of civil disobedience. \n\nGandhi\u2019s trip to England nevertheless made the South African \nIndian question a major imperial concern. Therein lay a seed of \nultimate triumph in South Africa. \n\nMoreover, and apparently for the first time, Gandhi began, \nduring his London sojourn, to connect himself with the problem \nof India\u2019s independence. In England he sought out Indians of all \nshades of political belief: nationalists, Home-Rulers, anarchists \nand advocates of assassination. While he debated with them far \ninto many nights, his own political views and philosophy were \ntaking shape. Some of the tenets which later formed the tissue of \nthe Mahatma\u2019s creed found their first expression in a letter \naddressed to Lord Ampthill by Gandhi on October gth, , \nfrom Westminster Palace Hotel. \n\nJudging by the Indians in England, Gandhi wrote, impatience \nwith British rule was widespread in India as was Indian hatred of \nthe British. Partisans of violence were gaining ground. Against \nthis, repression would be futile. Yet he feared that \u2018the British \nrulers will not give liberally and in time. The British people seem \n\n\u201c \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nto be obsessed by the demon of commercial selfishness. The fault \nis not of men but of the system . . . India is exploited in the \ninterests of foreign capitalists. The true remedy lies, in my humble \nopinion, in England discarding modern civilization . . . which is a \nnegation of the spirit of Christianity\u2019. One hears Tolstoy\u2019s gentle \nvoice here and echoes, too, of the raucous voices of Indian \nstudents in Bloomsbury. \n\n\u2018But this is a large order,\u2019 Gandhi admits. \u2018The railways, \nmachineries and the corresponding increase of indulgent habits \nare the true badge of slavery of the Indian people, as they are of \nEuropeans. I therefore have no quarrel with the rulers. I have \nevery quarrel with their methods ... To me the rise of cities like \nCalcutta and Bombay is a matter of sorrow rather than con\u00ac \ngratulations. India has lost in having broken up a part of her \nvillage system. \n\n\u2018Holding these views,\u2019 Gandhi continues, prophetically though \nunconsciously enunciating the programme of his entire career in \nIndia, \u2018I share the National spirit, but I totally dissent from the \nmethods, whether of the extremists or of the moderates, for either \nparty relies on violence ultimately. Violent methods must mean \nan acceptance of modern civilization and therefore of the same \nruinous competition we notice here and the consequent destruc\u00ac \ntion of morality. I should be uninterested in the fact as to who \nrules. I should expect rulers to rule according to my wish, other\u00ac \nwise I cease to help them to rule me. I become a passive resister \nagainst them.\u2019 \n\nLong before Gandhi had any warrant to regard himself as a \nfactor or leader in the liberation of India he knew, and indicated \nin this letter to Ampthill, that his aim Was not merely substitution \nof Indian rule for British rule. Not governments but methods and \nobjectives interested him, not whether a William or a Chandra \nsat in the seat of power but whose deeds were more civilized. \n\nThis is what distinguished Gandhi from other politicians. The \nargument \u2014 Was Gandhi a saint or politician? \u2014 is endless yet \nbarren. Polak quotes Gandhi as having said in South Africa, \n\u2018Men say I am a saint losing myself in politics. The fact is that I \nam a politician trying my hardest to be a saint.\u2019 The important \nfact is that in politics Gandhi always cleaved to religious and moral \nconsiderations and as a saint he never thought his place was in a \n\n\n \n\n\nTHE SHAPE OF THINGS TO GOME \n\ncave or cloister but rather in the hurly-burly of the popular \nstruggle for rights and right. Gandhi\u2019s religion cannot be divorced \nfrom his politics. His religion made him political. His politics \nwere religious. \n\nWhen Gandhi returned from England to South Africa at the \nend of , political necessity forced him to establish \u2018a sort of \nco-operative commonwealth\u2019 on a diminutive scale where civil \nresisters \u2018would be trained to live a new and simple life in harmony \nwith one another\u2019. There he took further steps towards sainthood, \nmahatma-ship, and Gita detachment. \n\nPreviously, when Satyagrahis were imprisoned, the organiza\u00ac \ntion attempted to support their dependants in their accustomed \nstyle of living. This led to inequality and sometimes to fraud. \nGandhi consequently decided that the movement needed a rural \ncommune for civil resisters and their familes. Phoenix Farm was \nthirty hours by train and hence too remote from the epicentre of \nthe Transvaal struggle. \n\nAccordingly, Herman Kallenbach bought  acres of land at \nLawley, twenty-one miles outside Johannesburg and, on May th, \n, gave it to the Satyagrahis free of any rent or charge. Here \nreligion was wed to politics. Gandhi called it The Tolstoy Farm. \n\nThe farm had over a thousand orange, apricot and plum trees, \ntwo wells, a spring and one house. Additional houses were built \nof corrugated iron. Gandhi and his family came to live on the \nfarm and so did Kallenbach. \n\n\u2018I prepare the bread that is required on the farm,\u2019 Gandhi \nwrote to a friend in India. \u2018The general opinion about it is that it \nis well made. We put in no yeast and no baking powder. We \ngrind our own wheat. We have just prepared some marmalade \nfrom the oranges grown on the farm. I have also learned how to \nprepare caramel coffee. It can be given as a beverage even to \nbabies. The passive resisters on the farm have given up the use of \ntea and coffee, and taken to caramel coffee prepared on the farm. \nIt is made from wheat which is first baked in a certain way and \nthen ground. We intend to sell our surplus production of the \nabove three articles to the public later on. Just at present, we are \nworking as labourers on the construction work . . .\u2019 There were \nno servants. \n\nGandhi was baker and caramel and marmalade maker and much \n\n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nmore besides. Kallenbach went to stay in a Trappist monastery \nfor German Catholic monks to master the art of sandal making. \nThis he then taught to Gandhi who taught it to others. Surplus \nsandals were sold to friends. As an architect, Kallenbach knew \nsomething of carpentry and headed that department. Gandhi \nlearned to make cabinets, chests of drawers and school benches. \nBut they had no chairs and no beds; everybody slept on the ground \nand, except in inclement weather, in the open. Each person got \ntwo blankets and a wooden pillow. Gandhi likewise sewed jackets \nfor his wife and he later boasted that she wore them. \n\nGandhi was general manager. The population of the farm, \nwhich varied with arrests and other circumstances, consisted \noriginally of forty young men, three old men, five women and \nbetween twenty and thirty children, of whom five were girls. \nThere were Hindus, Moslems, Christians and Parsis among them, \nvegetarians and meat-eaters, smokers and non-smokers and they \nspoke Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, etc. As if these conditions did \nnot create enough problems, Gandhi created some more. \n\nSmoking and alcohol drinking were strictly prohibited. Resi\u00ac \ndents could have meat if they wished but, after a little propaganda \nfrom the general manager, none ever asked for it. Gandhi assisted \nin the cookhouse and kept the women there from quarrelling. \n\nHe also supervised the sanitation, which was primitive, and \ntaught people not to spit. \u2018Leaving nightsoil, cleaning the nose, or \nspitting on the road is a sin against God and humanity,\u2019 he told \nthe community. \n\nOccasionally, Kallenbach had business in town and Gandhi \nstill had legal cases. The rule was that if you went on an errand \nor shopping trip for the commune you could travel by train, third \nclass; but if the journey was private or for fun (children liked to \ngo on picnics to Johannesburg) you had to walk and, for economy, \ntake dry refreshments with you. Gandhi frequently walked the \ntwenty-one miles to the city, starting at  a.m. and returning \nthe same night. He said it did them all a lot of good. One day, \nhe recalls, \u2018I walked fifty miles on foot.\u2019 \n\nGandhi attributed his physical stamina and that of the other \ncommunards to pure living and healthy diet. Breakfast was at \n, lunch at ii, dinner at ., prayers at ., bedtime at . All \nmeals were light. But to make them lighter still, Gandhi and \n\n \n\n\nTHE SHAPE OF THINGS TO GOME \n\nKallenbach resolved to avoid cooked food and limit themselves to \na \u2018fruitarian\u2019 menu of bananas, dates, lemons, peanuts, oranges \nand olive oil. Gandhi had read somewhere of the cruelties \npractised in India to make cows and water buffaloes yield the \nmaximum in milk. So he and Kallenbach dispensed with milk. \nKallenbach, who owned a beautiful and spacious house on a hill\u00ac \ntop above Johannesburg, and who always had lived in luxury, \nshared every deprivation, chore and dietary experiment on the \nfarm. He also divided with Gandhi the task of teaching the \nchildren religion, geography, history, arithmetic, etc., and very \nrudimentary it all was. \n\nGandhi\u2019s ideas on co-education were unconventional. He \nencouraged boys and girls, some of them adolescents, to bathe at \nthe spring at the same time. For the girls\u2019 safety, he was always \npresent and \u2018My eyes followed the girls as a mother\u2019s eye follows \na daughter.\u2019 No doubt, the boys\u2019 eyes did likewise and less \ninnocently. At night, everybody slept on an open veranda and \nthe young folks grouped their sleeping places around Gandhi. \nBeds were only three feet apart. But Gandhi said the young folks \nknew he loved them \u2018with a mother\u2019s love\u2019, and hadn\u2019t he ex\u00ac \nplained the duty of self-restraint to them? \n\nAfter an incident involving two girls, he searched for a method \n\u2018to sterilize the sinner\u2019s eye\u2019 of males. The quest kept him awake \nall night, but in the morning he had it: he summoned the girls \nand suggested that they shave their heads. They were shocked, \nbut he had an irresistible way and finally they consented. He \nhimself did the cutting. \n\nYears later, Gandhi explained this innocence by ignorance, but \nhe did not explain why he should have been ignorant. He \ndispelled some of the mystery by adding that his \u2018faith and courage \nwere at their highest in Tolstoy Farm\u2019. Boundless faith in human \nbeings sometimes blinded him to their faults. It was the sort of \nblindness which blots out obstacles and thus leads to brave \nventures. He measured other people\u2019s capacities by his own. \nThis often spurred them to unwonted effort. It was good peda\u00ac \ngogy if it worked; it worked better with adults and little children \nthan with adolescents. \n\nIn October , Krishna Gopal Gokhale, Professor of English \nand Economics, President of the Servants of India Society in India, \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\ncame to South Africa for a month in order to assess the Indian \ncommunity\u2019s condition and assist Gandhi in ameliorating it. \nGokhale and Lokamanya Tilak were Gandhi\u2019s forerunners in \npre-Gandhian India. Gokhale was a revered leader of the Indian \nNationalist movement, a brilliant intellectual and an impressive \nperson. Gandhi acknowledged him an excellent judge of char\u00ac \nacter. In South Africa, Gokhale once said to Gandhi, \u2018You will \nalways have your own way. And there is no help for me as I am \nhere at your mercy.\u2019 The dictum was spoken in friendship and in \nearnest. \n\nGandhi\u2019s selflessness fortified his assurance. Certain in his \nheart that he sought neither material gain, nor power, nor praise, \nhe had none of the guilty and deterring feeling which might have \nprevented him from insisting on his point of view. Sure he was \nright, he was sure of victory. Then why yield? When Gokhale \nasked for a list of the really reliable civil resisters, Gandhi wrote \ndown sixty-six names. That was maximum. The number, \nhowever, might sink to sixteen. This was Gandhi\u2019s \u2018army of \npeace\u2019. Yet he never flinched; the Government would surrender. \n\nGokhale\u2019s tour was a triumphal procession through South \nAfrica. Gandhi was always by his side. In Cape Town, where \nGokhale landed, the Schreiners welcomed him, and Europeans as \nwell as Indians attended his big public meeting. From the Trans\u00ac \nvaal frontier to Johannesburg he travelled by special train. At \nevery town he stopped for a meeting over which the local mayor \npresided. The principal railway stations had been decorated by \nIndians. At the Park Terminus in Johannesburg a large orna\u00ac \nmental arch designed by Kallenbach was erected. During his \nstay in Johannesburg Gokhale had the use of the mayor\u2019s car. \nAt Pretoria, capital of the Transvaal, the Government entertained \nhim. \n\nThe South African authorities wanted Gokhale to carry back a \ngood impression to India. \n\nAfter making many speeches and talking to many Indians and \nwhites, Gokhale had a two-hour interview with Generals Botha \nand Smuts, the heads, now, of the Union government. Gandhi, \nof his own accord, absented himself; he was a controversial figure \nwho might spoil the atmosphere. \n\nWhen Gokhale came back from the interview, he reported that \n\n \n\n\nTHE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME \n\n\nthe racial bar in the Immigration Act would be removed together \nwith the three-pound annual tax collected from indentured \nlabourers who remained in South Africa but did not continue \ntheir indenture. \n\nT doubt it very much/ Gandhi retorted. \u2018You do not know the \nMinisters as I do.  \n\n\u2018What I have told you is bound to come to pass/ Gokhale cried. \n\u2018General Botha promised me that the Black Act would be repealed \nand the three-pound tax abolished. You must return to India \nwithin twelve months and I will not have any of your excuses.* \n\nGandhi was glad of the Government\u2019s promise; it proved the \njustice of the Indian cause. But he did not think his job in the \nUnion of South Africa would be completed before many more \nIndians, and he too, had again gone to prison. \n\nAt Gokhale\u2019s request, GaUdhi and Kallenbach took the steamer \nwith him as far as Zanzibar in Tanganyika. On board, Gokhale \ntalked at length about Indian politics, economics, superstitions, \nproblems. He was introducing Gandhi to the future. Then Gok\u00ac \nhale sailed on to India, and Gandhi and Kallenbach returned to \nNatal for the final struggle. \n\nAddressing an assembly in Bombay Town Hall in December \n, Gokhale said, \u2018Gandhi has in him the marvellous spiritual \npower to turn ordinary men around him into heroes and martyrs.\u2019 \nGokhale, who looked critically at Gandhi and sometimes rebuked \nhim, added that in Gandhi\u2019s presence one is \u2018ashamed to do \nanything unworthy\u2019, indeed one is \u2018afraid of thinking anything \nunworthy\u2019. \n\nGandhi proved this to the hilt in the final chapter of the South \nAfrica epic. \n\n\n  CHAPTER XIII \n\n\nTOLSTOY AND GANDHI \n\nI N central Russia, a Slav aristocrat grappled with the same \nspiritual problems that occupied the Hindu lawyer in South \nAfrica. Across continents, Count Leo Tolstoy guided Mohan\u00ac \ndas K. Gandhi and found solace in his struggle. \n\nIn Gandhi\u2019s law office there were several books by Tolstoy on \nreligious subjects. But it was only during the leisure of jail that \nthe Indian absorbed the great Russian\u2019s teachings. \n\nWar and Peace , probably the world\u2019s greatest novel. Resurrection , \nAnna Karenina , and other works of art brought Tolstoy colossal \nsuccess and universal recognition. But his soul was always in \ntorment. The discrepancy between Christ\u2019s message and man\u2019s \nway of life troubled him. Born in  to wealth and an ancient \ntitle, Tolstoy abandoned high society and, at the age of fifty-seven, \nadopted the simple life: he went barefoot, wore a plain muzhik \nsmock and trousers, ploughed, harrowed and planted by the side \nof the peasants, gave up smoking, meat-eating and hunting, and \nbegan to take long cross-country walks and bicycle rides. In , \nin order to escape from \u2018intolerable luxury\u2019, he gave his ample \nproperties to his wife and children and devoted himself to vil\u00ac \nlage education, famine relief and writing about vegetarianism, \nmarriage and theology. Though he excoriated church institu\u00ac \ntions, men and women in search of a faith made his home at \nYasnaya Polyana their Mecca; Christians, Jews, Moslems and \nBuddhists from the four corners of the earth came to sit at the \nfeet of the famous, brilliant nobleman who had drunk his fill of \nmaterial pleasures and now, nearing seventy, sought God. Among \nhis guests from abroad were Jane Addams, of Hull House, Chicago; \nWilliam Jennings Bryan, subsequently United States Secretary \nof State; Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf of Philadelphia; George \nKennan, an American publicist who visited Siberia with the \npermission of the Tsarist authorities and then denounced their \ncruelty to prisoners; Rainer-Maria Rilke, the German poet, and \nThomas G. Masaryk, later President of Czechoslovakia. \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nTo these pilgrims, Tolstoy was the strong one who had re\u00ac \nnounced. His attraction was his attempt to create, in his own way \nof life, a synthesis between creed and conduct. This involved \nmanual labour, minimum needs, no holding of property, no \nkilling. He called landlordism \u2018a great sin\u2019, extolled Henry \nGeorge\u2019s Single Tax, condemned military conscription, defended \nconscientious objectors, helped the pacifist Dukhobors to emigrate \nto Canada, denounced the pogromists of Kishenev, praised \nWilliam Lloyd Garrison\u2019s \u2018non-resistance\u2019, taught in a village \nprimary school and refused the Nobel Prize because he did not \naccept money. \n\nThe Orthodox Church of Russia excommunicated him. \n\nTo a friend in prison Tolstoy wrote, \u2018Unfortunately, I am not \nin prison. . . .\u2019 \n\nThe titles of his tracts reveal his mind: Thou Shalt Kill No One, \nLove One Another , Why Christian People in General and the Russian \nPeople Especially Fall into Distress , The Teachings of Christ for Children, \nCapital Punishment and Christianity , Religious Tolerance, Self-Perfection, \nand many more like these. \n\nTolstoy died on November th, , after fleeing from his \nwife in the hope of finding peace in a monastery or a Tolstoyan \nsettlement. \n\nGandhi came to know Tolstoy through The Kingdom of God \nIs Within You. The name of the volume is the gospel of its \nauthor. \n\n\u2018The history of the church\u2019, Tolstoy bluntly affirmed, \u2018is the \nhistory of cruelties and horror ... Every Church, with its doctrines \nof redemption and salvation, and above all the Orthodox faith \nwith its idolatry, excludes the doctrine of Christ.\u2019 Impartially, \nand with icy logic and myriad quotations, Tolstoy proved to his \nown satisfaction that all Christian churches try \u2018to conceal the \ntrue meaning of the doctrine of Christ\u2019. \n\nTolstoy was equally critical of governments. From the dimmest \nages, he declared, \u2018Peace unto you\u2019 has been man\u2019s greeting to \nman, yet in Europe Christian nations keep twenty-eight million \nmen under arms to settle problems by killing. Approvingly he \nquoted Guy de Maupassant, the French writer: \u2018It is stupefying \nthat society doe not revolt as a unit against the very sound of the \nword \u201cWar\u201d.\u2019 \n\n\n \n\n\nTOLSTOY AND GANDHI \n\n\nAlexander Herzen, Russia\u2019s great literary critic, had said that \nmounting militarism made every modern government \u2018a Genghis \nKhan with telegraphic equipment\u2019. Tolstoy concurred and added, \n\u2018In the matter of oppression, the Christian nations are worse than \nthe pagans.\u2019 \n\nT believe it is Max Mueller [foremost authority on Asia],\u2019 Tol\u00ac \nstoy recalled, \u2018who describes the astonishment of an Indian con\u00ac \nverted to Christianity who, having learned the essence of Christian \ndoctrine, came to Europe and beheld the life of Christians.\u2019 This \nwas Tolstoy\u2019s, as it was Thoreau\u2019s, perpetual theme: the chasm \nbetween doctrine and doing. \n\nWhat to do? Tolstoy\u2019s answer was simple: Live as a Christian \nshould. Concretely, \u2018A Christian enters into no dispute with his \nneighbour, he neither attacks nor uses violence; on the contrary, \nhe suffers himself, without resistance, and by his very attitude \ntowards evil not only sets himself free, but helps to free the world \nat large from all outward authority.\u2019 \n\nThe Gita and the Sermon on the Mount had led Gandhi to the \nsame conclusion. \n\nTolstoy preached peaceful, painful refusal to serve Or obey evil \ngovernments. He specified: no oath of allegiance, no oath in \ncourt \u2018for an oath is distinctly forbidden by the Gospel\u2019, no police \nduty, no military duty, no payment of taxes. \n\n\u2018What are governments to do with these men?\u2019 Tolstoy inquired. \n\nThat became Smuts\u2019s problem. He did not know what to do \nwith the Indians. \u2018The position of governments in the presence \nof men who profess Christianity\u2019, Tolstoy wrote, \u2018is so precarious \nthat very little is needed to shake their power to pieces.\u2019 Thoreau \nsaid the same thing. \n\nGandhi began by freeing himself. It was an involved process. \nFor man is bound by many chains, and the stoutest are forged in \nthe inner smithy, not by Church or State. \u2018The Kingdom of God \nis within you.\u2019 You are what you make yourself. You are not free \nbecause you do not free yourself. \n\n\u2018The Kingdom of God\u2019, Tolstoy wrote, \u2018is attained by . . . sacri\u00ac \nficing outward circumstances for the sake of truth.\u2019 \n\nGandhi\u2019s path was strewn with the outward possessions and \npleasures which he cast off en route to the kingdom of God within \nhim. \n\n\nrl  \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nGandhi\u2019s first personal contact with Tolstoy was in the form of \na long letter, written in English, dated \u2018Westminster Palace Hotel, \n Victoria Street, S.W., London, October ist, \u2019, and sent \nfrom there to Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana, in central Russia. In \nit, he acquainted the Russian novelist with the civil disobedience \nmovement in the Transvaal. \n\nIn Tolstoy\u2019s diary entry for September th,  (the Russian \ncalendar was then thirteen days behind the Western calendar), \nhe wrote, \u2018Received a pleasant letter from a Hindu of the Trans\u00ac \nvaal.\u2019 Four days later, Tolstoy wrote a letter to Vladimir G. \nChertkov, his intimate friend and, later, the editor of his collected \nworks, saying, \u2018The letter of the Transvaal Hindu has touched me.\u2019 \n\nDating his letter from Yasnaya Polyana, October th (th), \n, Tolstoy wrote a reply to Gandhi in Russian. The Russian \ntext was translated into English by Tolstoy\u2019s daughter, Tatiana, \nwho sent it to Gandhi. Tolstoy wrote, \u2018I have just received your \nmost interesting letter, which has given me great pleasure. God \nhelp our dear brothers and co-workers in the Transvaal. The same \nstruggle of the soft against the harsh, of meekness and love against \npride and violence, is making itself felt every year more and more \namong us here ... I greet you fraternally and am happy to have \ncontact with you. (signed) Tolstoy.\u2019 \n\nGandhi\u2019s second letter to Tolstoy was written in Johannesburg \non April th, , and was accompanied by a copy of Gandhi\u2019s \nlittle book, Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule . In the letter Gandhi \nsaid, \u2018As a humble follower of yours, I send you herewith a booklet \nwhich I have written. It is my own [English] translation of a \nGujarati writing ... I am most anxious not to worry you, but if \nyour health permits it, and if you could find the time to go through \nthe booklet, needless to say I shall value very highly your criticism \nof the writing.\u2019 \n\nOn April th, , Tolstoy wrote as follows in his diary: \n\u2018This morning two Japanese arrived. Wild men in ecstasy over \nEuropean civilization. On the other hand, the book and the \nletter of the Hindu reveal an understanding of all the short\u00ac \ncomings of European civilization and even of its total in\u00ac \nadequacy.\u2019 \n\nNext day there was another entry in Tolstoy\u2019s diary: \u2018Yesterday \nI read Gandhi on civilization. Very good.\u2019 And again the next \n\n \n\n\nTOLSTOY AND GANDHI \n\n\nday: \u2018Read a book about Gandhi. Very important. I must write \nto him/ The book about Gandhi was the Biography of Gandhi by \nJ. J. Doke, which Gandhi had sent to Tolstoy. \n\nA day later, Tolstoy wrote a letter to his friend Chertkov in \nwhich he referred to Gandhi as \u2018a person very close to us, to me\u2019. \n\nTolstoy replied to Gandhi on April th (May th), , from \nYasnaya Polyana. He wrote: \n\nDear Friend: I just received your letter and your book, Indian \nHome Rule . I read your book with great interest because of the \nthings and questions you treat in it: passive resistance is a question \nof the greatest importance, not only for India, but for the whole of \nhumanity. \n\nI cannot find your former letters, but came across your bio\u00ac \ngraphy by J. Doss [this is a mistake made by Tolstoy] which too \ninterested me much and gave me the possibility to know and \nunderstand your letter. I am not quite well at present and there\u00ac \nfore abstain from writing to you all what I have to say about \nyour book and all your work, which I appreciate very much, but \nI will do it as soon as I will feel better. Your friend and brother, \nL. Tolstoy. \n\nThis was the English translation, sent to Gandhi, of Tolstoy\u2019s \nperfect Russian. \n\nGandhi\u2019s third letter to Tolstoy is dated \u2018- Court Chambers, \ncorner Rissik and Anderson Streets, Johannesburg, August th, \n\u2019. In it Gandhi acknowledged Tolstoy\u2019s letter of May th, \nwith thanks, and added: \u2018I shall look forward to your detailed \ncriticism of the work which you have been so good as to promise \nin your letter.\u2019 Gandhi also informed Tolstoy of the establishment \nof Tolstoy Farm by Kallenbach and himself. He said that Kallen- \nbach was writing to Tolstoy about the farm. The letters of \nGandhi and Kallenbach, accompanied by several issues of \nGandhi\u2019s weekly, Indian Opinion , heightened Tolstoy\u2019s interest \nin Gandhi. In his diary of September th (th), , Tolstoy \nwrote, \u2018Pleasant news from Transvaal about the passive resistance \ncolony.\u2019 Tolstoy was at this time in a state of serious spiritual \ndepression and physically ill. Nevertheless, he replied to Gandhi\u2019s \nletter on the day he received it. Tolstoy dictated the letter on the \nevenings of the th and th of September (th and th). On the \n\nh m.g.  \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nth (th), Tolstoy corrected the letter and sent it in Russian to \nChertkov for English translation. \n\nIt was Chertkov who posted Tolstoy\u2019s letter to Gandhi. Chert\u00ac \nkov included in the letter a letter of his own in which he said: \n\nMy friend, Leo Tolstoy, has requested me to acknowledge the \nreceipt of your letter to him of August th and to translate into \nEnglish his letter to you of September th (new style-th Sept.) \nwritten originally in Russian. \n\nAll you communicate about Mr. Kallenbach has greatly \ninterested Tolstoy, who has asked me to answer for him Mr. \nKallenbach\u2019s letter. Tolstoy sends you and your co-workers his \nheartiest greetings and warmest wishes for the success of your \nwork, his appreciation of which you will gather from the enclosed \ntranslation of his letter to you. I must apologize for my mistakes \nin English in the translation, but living in the country in Russia, \nI am unable to profit by the assistance of any Englishman for \ncorrecting my mistakes. \n\nWith Tolstoy\u2019s permission his letter to you will be published in \na small periodical printed by some friends of ours in London. A \ncopy of the magazine with the letter shall be forwarded to you, \nas also some English publications of Tolstoy\u2019s writings issued by \n The Free Age Press\u2019. \n\nAs it seems to me most desirable that more should be known in \nEnglish about your movement, I am writing to a great friend of \nmine and Tolstoy, Mrs. Mayo, of Glasgow, proposing that she \nshould enter into communication with you. . . . \n\nChertkov sent a separate letter to Mr. Kallenbach. \n\nTolstoy\u2019s own letter to Gandhi was the longest in the whole \ncorrespondence. Dated September th (th), , and trans\u00ac \nlated into English by Chertkov, it was sent to an intermediary in \nEngland for posting to Gandhi. The intermediary was ill at the \ntime and only posted the letter on November st, so that Gandhi \nreceived the letter in the Transvaal several days after the death \nof Count Leo Tolstoy. \n\nTolstoy said: \n\nThe longer I live, and especially now when I vividly feel the \nnearness of death, I want to tell others what I feel so particularly \n\n \n\n\nTOLSTOY AND GANDHI \n\n\nclearly and what to my mind is of great importance \u2014 namely, \nthat which is called passive resistance, but which in reality is \nnothing else than the teaching of love, uncorrupted by false \ninterpretations. \n\nThat love ... is the highest and only law of human life and in \nthe depths of his soul every human being (as we see most clearly \nin children) feels and knows this; he knows this until he is en\u00ac \ntangled by the false teachings of the world. This law was pro\u00ac \nclaimed by all, by the Indian as well as by the Chinese, Hebrew, \nGreek and Roman sages of the world. . . . \n\nIn reality, as soon as force was admitted into love, there was no \nmore and there could be no more love as the law of life, and as \nthere was no law of love, there was no law at all, except violence \u2014 \ni.e. the power of the strongest. Thus Christian mankind has lived \nfor nineteen centuries. . . . \n\nThis was a very old man on the brink of death writing to a very \nyoung man; Gandhi was young, usually twenty-five years younger \nin spirit than his age. Tolstoy was profoundly unhappy. Anyone \nwith the insight of War and Peace yet conscious of humanity\u2019s \nrefusal, or inability, to use the key to happiness available in Christ\u2019s \nteachings would have to be unhappy. Gandhi, however, believed \nhe could reform himself and others. He was doing it. It made \nhim happy. ",
    "1913-1917": " CHAPTER XV \n\n\nTHE VICTORY \n\nS muts precipitated the final contest by announcing in the \nHouse of Assembly that the Europeans of Natal, who were the \noriginal employers of Indian contract labour, would not \npermit the lifting of the three-pound annual tax on ex-serfs. That \nwas the signal for the renewal of civil disobedience. Indentured \nlabourers and former indentured labourers considered this a \nbreach of the promise given to Professor Gokhale; they volun\u00ac \nteered en masse for Satyagraha. \n\nGandhi closed Tolstoy Farm. Kasturbai, Gandhi, the Gandhi \nchildren and several others moved to Phoenix Farm. Adults \nprepared to go to prison. \n\nThere were two issues: the tax and the ban on Asiatic immi\u00ac \ngrants. Presently, a third was added. On March th, , a \nJustice of the Cape Colony Supreme Court ruled that only \nChristian marriages were legal in South Africa. This invalidated \nHindu, Moslem, or Parsi marriages and turned all Indian wives \ninto concubines without rights. \n\nFor the first time, large numbers of women joined the resisters. \nKasturbai also joined. \n\nAs the opening move in the new campaign, a group of women \nvolunteers were to cross from the Transvaal into Natal and thereby \ncourt arrest. If the border police ignored them, they would pro\u00ac \nceed to the Natal coal field at Newcastle and urge the indentured \nminers to go on strike. Simultaneously, a chosen handful of Natal \n\u2018sisters  , as Gandhi called them, would invite arrest by entering \nthe Transvaal without permission. \n\nThe Natal \u2018sisters\u2019 were arrested and imprisoned. Indignation \nflared and brought new recruits. The Transvaal \u2018sisters\u2019 were not \narrested. They went to Newcastle and-persuaded the Indian \nworkers to put down their tools. Then the Government arrested \nthese women, too, and lodged them in jail for three months. \nAs a result, the miners\u2019 strike spread. \n\nGandhi hurried from Phoenix Farm to Newcastle. \n\n \n\n\nTHE VICTORY \n\n\nThe miners lived in company houses. The company turned off \ntheir light and water. \n\nGandhi believed the strike would last and therefore counselled \nthe indentured labourers to leave their compounds, taking their \nblankets and some clothes, and pitch camp outside the home of \nMr. and Mrs. D. M. Lazarus, a Christian couple from India, who \nhad invited Gandhi to stay with them despite the risks such \nhospitality entailed. \n\nThe strikers slept under the sky. Newcastle Indian merchants \ncontributed food and cooking and eating utensils. Before long, \nfive thousand strikers had assembled within sight of the Lazarus \nhouse. \n\nGandhi was astonished and baffled. What could he do with \nthis multitude? They might be on his hands for months. He \ndecided to \u2018see them safely deposited in jail\u2019 in the Transvaal. He \ninformed them of this prospect, described prison at its blackest \nand urged waverers to return to the mines. None did. It was then \nagreed that on a fixed day they would all march the thirty-six \nmiles from Newcastle to Charlestown, on the Natal-Transvaal \nborder, walk into the Transvaal and thereby earn jail sentences. \nA few women with children, and disabled men were to travel by \nrail towards the same goal. \n\nWhile plans were being made, more strikers arrived. Again \nGandhi attempted, without success, to dissuade them from fol\u00ac \nlowing him. Accordingly, October th was set as the day of \ndeparture from Newcastle. He was able to furnish each \u2018soldier\u2019 \nwith a pound and a half of bread and an ounce of sugar. Instruc\u00ac \ntions were: Conduct yourselves morally, hygienically and pacific\u00ac \nally. Submit to police flogging and abuse. Do not resist arrest. \n\nCharlestown was reached without incident. Preparations to \nreceive the Gandhi army had been made in advance by Kallen- \nbach and others. The Indian merchants of Charlestown (normal \npopulation one thousand) contributed rice, vegetables, kitchen \nequipment, etc. Gandhi was chef and head waiter. Complaints \nabout inadequate portions were met with an infectious smile and \na report on the total amount of food available and the amount of \neach person\u2019s equal ration. \n\nWomen and children were accommodated in houses; the men \nslept in the grounds of the local mosque. \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nBefore moving on, Gandhi communicated his intentions to the \nGovernment. He and his people were coming into the Transvaal \nto demonstrate against the breach of the Botha-Smuts pledge and \nto assert their self-respect: T cannot conceive a greater loss to a \nman that the loss of his self-respect.  Of course, he added, the \nNatal government could arrest them in Charlestown and thus \nspare them further treks. On the other hand, if the Government \nannulled the three-pound tax the strikers would resume the mining \nof coal. \n\nThe Government did not oblige by arresting them at Charles\u00ac \ntown, nor did it eliminate the three-pound levy. In fact, Gandhi \nsuspected that the authorities might not stop the \u2018army  even if it \npenetrated into the Transvaal. In that case, he contemplated \nadvancing on Tolstoy Farm by eight day-marches of twenty miles \neach. \n\nHow would he feed his peace troops on the road for eight days? \nA European baker at Volksrust, the Transvaal border town, \nundertook to supply them in Volksrust and then to ship the \nnecessary quantity of bread by rail each day to an appointed spot \nen route to the farm. \n\nGandhi counted his forces. There were  men,  women \nand  children. At . on the morning of November th, , \nGandhi recalls, \u2018we offered prayers and commenced the march \nin the name of God  . \n\nFrom Charlestown on the Natal side to Volksrust is one mile. \nA large detachment of Transvaal mounted border guards was on \nemergency duty. Two days earlier the Volksrust whites had held \na meeting at which several speakers declared they personally \nwould shoot any Indian who attempted to enter the Transvaal. \nKallenbach, who attended to defend the Indians, was challenged \nto a duel. He was a pupil of the great Sandow, and an accom\u00ac \nplished pugilist and wrestler, but the Gandhian German arose and \nsaid, \u2018As I have accepted the religion of peace I may not accept \nthe challenge .. . The Indians do not want what you imagine \n. . . The Indians are not out to challenge your position as rulers. \nThey do not wish to fight with you or to fill the country . . . They \npropose to enter the Transvaal not with a view to settle there, but \nonly as an effective demonstration against the unjust tax which is \nlevied upon them. They are brave men. They will not injure \n\n \n\n\nTHE VICTORY \n\n\nyou in person or in property, they will not fight with you, but \nenter the Transvaal they will, even in the face of your gunfire. \nThey are not the men to beat a retreat from the fear of your bullets \nor spears. They propose to melt and I know they will melt, your \nhearts by self-suffering.\u2019 \n\nNobody shot anybody; perhaps Kallenbach\u2019s speech turned \naway the white wrath. Perhaps the police reinforcements at the \nborder sobered the hotheads. The guards let the Indians pass. \n\nThe first halt was made at Palmford, eight miles beyond Volks- \nrust. The marchers ate a meagre meal and stretched out on the \nearth for sleep. Gandhi had surveyed his slumbering resisters \nand was about to lie down when he heard steps and a moment \nlater saw a policeman approaching, lantern in hand. \n\nT have a warrant to arrest you,\u2019 the officer said politely to \nGandhi. T want to arrest you.  \n\n\u2018When?\u2019 Gandhi asked. \n\n\u2018Now,\u2019 the policeman replied. \n\n\u2018Where will you take me?\u2019 \n\n\u2018To the adjoining station first,\u2019 the officer explained democratic\u00ac \nally, \u2018and to Volksrust when there is a train.\u2019 \n\nGandhi woke Mr. P. K. Naidoo, a faithful lieutenant, and gave \nhim instructions for continuing the march to Tolstoy Farm. \nGandhi was transported to Volksrust and arraigned in court. \nThe prosecutor demanded imprisonment, but the judge released \nGandhi on bail furnished by Kallenbach. Gandhi had asked for \nrelease on bail because of his responsibilities to the marchers. \nKallenbach, stationed in Volksrust to send on stragglers and new \nrecruits, had a car ready and quickly drove Gandhi back to the \nIndian \u2018army\u2019. \n\nThe next day the Indians halted at Standerton. Gandhi was \nhanding out bread and marmalade when a magistrate stepped \nup and said to Gandhi, \u2018You are my prisoner.\u2019 \n\n\u2018It seems I have been promoted,\u2019 Gandhi commented with a \nlaugh, \u2018since magistrates take the trouble to arrest me instead of \nmere police officials.\u2019 \n\nAgain Gandhi was freed on bail. Five co-workers were Im\u00ac \nprisoned. \n\nTwo days later, November th, as Gandhi and Polak were \nwalking at the head of the long column, a cart came up and the \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nofficer in it ordered Gandhi to go with him. Gandhi passed the \ncommand to Polak. The officer permitted Gandhi to inform the \nmarchers of his arrest, but when the little \u2018general\u2019 began to \nexhort the Indians to remain peaceful, the officer exclaimed, \u2018You \nare now a prisoner and cannot make any speeches.\u2019 \n\nIn four days, Gandhi had been arrested three times. \n\nThe march continued without the leader. \n\nOn the morning of the ioth, on reaching Balfour, the Indians \nsaw three special trains drawn up at the station to deport them \nfrom the Transvaal to Natal. At first they refused to submit to \narrest, and it was only through the co-operation of Polak, Ahmed \nKachhalia and others that the police were able to herd the \nmarchers into the trains. \n\nPolak was thanked for his services and arrested and confined in \nVolksrust jail. There he found Kallenbach. \n\nOn November th, Gandhi was brought to trial in Volksrust. \nHe pleaded guilty. The court, however, \u2018would not convict a \nprisoner\u2019, Gandhi wrote, \u2018merely upon his pleading guilty\u2019. It \ntherefore requested him to supply the witnesses against himself \nand Gandhi did so. Kallenbach and Polak testified against him. \n\nTwenty-four hours later, Gandhi appeared as a witness against \nKallenbach and two days after that, Gandhi and Kallenbach \ntestified against Polak. Judge Theodore Jooste reluctantly gave \neach of them three months\u2019 hard labour in the Volksrust prison. \n\nFresh prisoners kept Gandhi informed on Satyagraha develop\u00ac \nments outside. The arrest of the leaders and marchers had stirred \nnew enthusiasm and the number of resisters throughout South \nAfrica mounted fast. Occasionally, Gandhi could send messages \nto followers still at liberty. Meanwhile Gandhi rejoiced in con\u00ac \ngenial company. This was too much of a good thing and the \nGovernment shifted him to Bloemfontein where he was with \nEuropeans and Negroes, but no Indians. \n\nThe striking miners met a worse fate. Trains carried them \nback to the mines, where they were forced into wire-enclosed \nstockades and placed under company employees who had been \nsworn in as special constables. Despite whips, sticks and kicks, \nthey refused to descend to the coal face. \n\nNews of these events was cabled to India and England. India \nseethed with resentment; the authorities grew alarmed. Lord \n\n \n\n\nTHE VICTORY \n\n\nHardinge, the British Viceroy, was impelled to deliver a strong \nspeech at Madras in which, breaking precedent, he trenchantly \ncriticized the South African government and demanded a com\u00ac \nmission of inquiry. \n\nMeanwhile, more indentured labourers left their work in \nsympathy with the rebellious Newcastle miners. The State re\u00ac \ngarded such labourers as slaves without the right to strike, and \nsent soldiers to suppress them. In one place some were killed \nand several wounded. \n\nThe tide of resistance rose higher. Approximately fifty thousand \nindentured labourers were on strike; several thousand free Indians \nwere in prison. From India came a stream of gold. At a meeting \nin Lahore, in the Punjab, a Christian missionary named Charles F. \nAndrews gave all the money he had to the South African move\u00ac \nment. Others made similar sacrifices. \n\nBy arrangement, several leading Indians and Albert West, who \nedited Indian Opinion , and Sonya Schlesin, Gandhi\u2019s secretary, \navoided arrest to conduct propaganda, handle finances and \ncommunicate with India and England. The Government never\u00ac \ntheless arrested Mr. West. Thereupon, Gokhale sent Andrews \nfrom India to replace him. He came with W. W. Pearson, another \nhigh-minded Englishman. \n\nCables between the Viceroy\u2019s office and London and between \nLondon and South Africa hummed with voluminous official \nmessages. \n\nUnexpectedly, the Government liberated Gandhi, Kallenbach \nand Polak on December th, . \u2018All three of us\u2019, Gandhi \nwrites, \u2018were disappointed upon our release.\u2019 Civil disobedience, \nproperly launched and inspired, needed no leaders. \n\nIf Gandhi wanted to be free he need not have gone to jail at all; \nhe could have refrained from opposing the Government. Going \ninto and coming out of prison had to advance the cause and this \ntime coming out did not. Under pressure from the Viceroy and \nthe British authorities in Whitehall, a commission had been \nappointed to investigate the grievances of the Indians in South \nAfrica and it was hoped that the release of Gandhi and his \ncolleagues would testify to the bona fides of Botha and Smuts in \nappointing it. \n\nBut upon regaining his liberty Gandhi asserted in a public \n\n m.g.  \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\nstatement that the commission \u2018is a packed body and intended to \nhoodwink the government and the public opinion both of England \nand of India\u2019. He did not doubt the \u2018integrity and impartiality\u2019 \nof the chairman, Sir William Solomon, but Mr. Ewald Esselen, he \nsaid, was prejudiced. With regard to the third member, he \nhad, in January , \u2018led a mob to demonstrate against the \nlanding of Indians who had arrived at Durban in two vessels, \nadvocated at a public meeting the sinking of two ships with all \nIndians on board and commending a remark made by another \nspeaker that he would willingly put down a month\u2019s pay for one \nshot at the Indians . . . He has consistently been our enemy all \nthese years\u2019. Gandhi was injured in that  assault. \n\nThree days after leaving prison, Gandhi appeared at a mass \nmeeting in Durban. He was no longer dressed in shirt and dun\u00ac \ngaree trousers. He wore a knee-length white smock, a white \nwrapping around his legs (an elongated loincloth) and sandals. \nHe had abandoned Western clothing. He did so, he told the \nmeeting, to mourn comrades killed during the miners\u2019 strike. \n\nReviewing the situation, Gandhi advised \u2018still greater purifying \nsuffering until at last the Government may order the military to \nriddle us also with bullets. \n\n\u2018My friends,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018are you prepared for this?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 the audience shouted. \n\n\u2018Are you prepared to share the fate of those of our countrymen \nwhom the cold stone is resting upon today?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 they shouted. \n\n\u2018I hope,\u2019 Gandhi proceeded, \u2018that every man, woman and \ngrown-up child will. . . not consider their salaries, trades, or even \nfamilies, or their own bodies. . . .\u2019 \n\nThe struggle, he emphasized, is \u2018a struggle for human liberty \nand therefore a struggle for religion\u2019. \n\nAfter the meeting Gandhi wrote to Smuts condemning the \nchoice of two members of the commission. \u2018Man\u2019, he philosophized, \n\u2018cannot change his temperament all at once. It is against the laws \nof nature to suppose that these gentlemen will suddenly become \ndifferent. . . .\u2019 \n\nSmuts replied three days later, rejecting Gandhi\u2019s proposal to \nadd Indians or pro-Indians to the commission. \n\nGandhi accordingly announced that on January st, , he \n\n \n\n\nTHE VICTORY \n\n\nand a group of Indians would march from Durban, Natal, to \ncourt arrest. They would not agitate for free immigration into \nthe Union, nor for political franchise in the near future, he de\u00ac \nclared. They merely wished to regain lost rights. \n\nWhile this embarrassing threat of an Indian mass march hung \nover the Government\u2019s head, the white employees of all the South \nAfrican railways went on strike. Gandhi immediately called off \nhis march. It was not part of the tactics of Satyagraha, he \nexplained, to destroy, hurt, humble, or embitter the adversary, \nor to win a victory by weakening him. Civil resisters hope, by \nsincerity, chivalry and self-suffering, to convince the opponent\u2019s \nbrain and conquer his heart. They never take advantage of the \nGovernment\u2019s difficulty or form unnatural alliances. \n\nCongratulations poured in on Gandhi; Lord Amp thill wired \nfrom England, so did others; messages of appreciation came from \nIndia and many points in South Africa. \n\nSmuts, busy with the railway strike (martial law had been \ndeclared), nevertheless summoned Gandhi to a talk. The first \ntalk led to another. The Government had accepted the principle \nof negotiation. Gandhi\u2019s friends warned him against deferring the \nmarch again. They recalled Smuts\u2019s broken pledge in . \n\n\u2018Forgiveness,\u2019 Gandhi replied, quoting the Sanskrit, \u2018is the \nornament of the brave.\u2019 \n\nGandhi\u2019s knightly forbearance in cancelling the march created \nan atmosphere favourable to a settlement. Gandhi\u2019s hand, more\u00ac \nover, was strengthened by the arrival, on a fast, special steamer, of \nSir Benjamin Robertson, extraordinary envoy of the Viceroy \nwho was worried about hostile reactions in India to South African \npersecutions. \n\nGandhi postponed the march a second time. \n\n\u2018Gandhi,\u2019 Smuts said at one of their interviews, \u2018this time we \nwant no misunderstanding, we want no mental or other reserva\u00ac \ntions, let all the cards be on the table and I want you to tell me \nwherever you think that a particular passage or word does not \nread in accordance with your own reading.\u2019 \n\nThis spirit, recognized as friendly by Gandhi, conduced to \nsteady if slow progress in the talks. ; You can\u2019t put twenty thou\u00ac \nsand Indians into jail,\u2019 Smuts declared in defence of his new, \nconciliatory attitude. \n\n\ni \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nSmuts and Gandhi placed their cards and texts on the table. \nMemoranda passed from one side to the other. For weeks, each \nword was weighed, each sentence sharpened for precision. On \nJune th, , the two subtle negotiators finally exchanged \nletters confirming the terms of a complete agreement. \n\nThis document was then translated into the Indian Relief Bill \nand submitted to the Union Parliament in Gape Town. Smuts \npleaded with Members to approach the problem fin a non- \ncontroversial spirit*. The bill became South African law in July. \n\nThe terms were: \n\n. Hindu, Moslem and Parsi marriages are valid. \n\n. The three-pound annual tax on indentured labourers who \nwish to remain in Natal is abolished; arrears are cancelled. \n\n. Indentured labour will cease coming from India by . \n\n. Indians could not move freely from one province of the \nUnion to another, but Indians born in South Africa might enter \nCape Colony. \n\nSmuts promised publicly that the law would be administered \nfin a just manner and with due regard to vested rights\u2019 of Indians. \n\nThe settlement was a compromise which pleased both sides. \nGandhi noted that Indians would still be \u2018cooped up\u2019 in their \nprovinces, they could not buy gold, they could not hold land in \nthe Transvaal, and they had difficulty in obtaining trade licences. \nBut he regarded the agreement as the \u2018Magna Charta\u2019 of South \nAfrican Indians. The gain, he told a farewell banquet in Johan\u00ac \nnesburg \u2014 he was feted at a dozen dinners \u2014 was not \u2018the intrinsic \nthings\u2019 in the law but the vindication of the abstract principle of \nracial equality and the removal of the \u2018racial taint\u2019. \n\nThe victory, moreover, was a vindication of civil resistance. \n\u2018It is a force which,\u2019 Gandhi wrote in Indian Opinion , \u2018if it became \nuniversal, would revolutionize social ideals and do away with \ndespotisms and the ever-growing militarism under which the \nnations of the West are groaning and are being almost crushed to \ndeath, and which fairly promises to overwhelm even the nations \nof the East.\u2019 \n\nHaving won the battle, Gandhi, accompanied by Mrs. Gandhi \nand Mr. Kallenbach, sailed for England on July th, . \nGandhi was in European clothes and looked gentle, thoughtful \nand tired. Kasturbai wore a white sari with a gay flower design \n\n \n\n\nTHE VICTORY \n\nand showed signs of suffering as well as beauty. Like her husband, \nshe was forty-five. \n\nJust before leaving South Africa for ever, Gandhi gave Miss \nSchlesin and Polak a pair of sandals he had made in prison and \nasked that they be delivered to General Smuts as a gift. Smuts \nwore them every summer at his own Doornkloof farm at Irene, \nnear Pretoria. In , on Gandhi\u2019s seventieth birthday, he \nreturned them to Gandhi in a gesture of friendship. Invited to \ncontribute to a Gandhi memorial volume on that occasion, Smuts, \nby then a world-famous statesman and war leader, complied and, \ngraciously calling himself \u2018an opponent of Gandhi a generation \nago\u2019, declared that men like the Mahatma \u2018redeem us from a \nsense of commonplace and futility and are an inspiration to us not \nto weary in well-doing. . . . \n\n\u2018The story of our clash in the early days of the Union of South \nAfrica\u2019, Smuts wrote, \u2018has been told by Gandhi himself and is \nwell known. It was my fate to be the antagonist of a man for \nwhom even then I had the highest respect. . . He never forgot the \nhuman background of the situation, never lost his temper or \nsuccumbed to hate, and preserved his gentle humour even in the \nmost trying situations. His manner and spirit even then, as well \nas later, contrasted markedly with the ruthless and brutal force\u00ac \nfulness which is the vogue in our day. . . . \n\n\u2018I must frankly admit\u2019, Smuts continued, \u2018that his activities at \nthat time were very trying to me . . . Gandhi . . . showed a new \ntechnique . . . His method was deliberately to break the law and \nto organize his followers into a mass movement... In both \nprovinces a wild and disconcerting commotion was created, large \nnumbers of Indians had to be imprisoned for lawless behaviour \nand Gandhi himself received \u2014 what no doubt he desired \u2014 a \nperiod of rest and quiet in jail. For him everything went accord\u00ac \ning to plan. For me \u2014 the defender of law and order \u2014 there was \nthe usual trying situation, the odium of carrying out a law which \nhad not strong public support, and finally the discomfiture when \nthe law was repealed.\u2019 \n\nSpeaking of Gandhi\u2019s present, Smuts remarked, \u2018I have worn \nthese sandals for many a summer since then, even though I may \nfeel that I am not worthy to stand in the shoes of so great a man.\u2019 \nSuch humour and generosity proved him worthy of Gandhi\u2019s mettle. \n\n \n\n\nTHE END AND THE BEGINNING \n\n\nPart of Gandhi\u2019s effectiveness lay in evoking the best Gandhian \nimpulses of his adversary. \n\nThe purity of Gandhi\u2019s methods made it difficult for Smuts to \noppose him. Victory came to Gandhi not when Smuts had no \nmore strength to fight him but when he had no more heart to \nfight him. \n\nProfessor Gilbert Murray wrote: \u2018Be careful in dealing with \na man who cares nothing for sensual pleasures, nothing for \ncomfort or praise or promotion, but is simply determined to do \nwhat he believes to be right. He is a dangerous and uncomfort\u00ac \nable enemy because his body which you can always conquer gives \nyou so little purchase over his soul.\u2019 \n\nThat was Gandhi, the leader. \n\nGandhi once recited these verses  of Shelley to a Christian \ngathering in India: \n\nStand ye calm and resolute, \n\nLike a forest close and mute, \n\nWith folded arms and looks which are \nWeapons in unvanquished war. \n\nAnd if then the tyrants dare, \n\nLet them ride among you there, \n\nSlash, and stab, and maim, and hew \u2014 \n\nWhat they like, that let them do. \n\nWith folded arms and steady eyes, \n\nAnd little fear, and less surprise, \n\nLook upon them as they slay \nTill their rage has died away. \n\nThen they will return with shame \nTo the place from which they came, \n\nAnd the blood thus shed will speak \nIn hot blushes on their cheek. \n\nRise like lions after slumber \nIn unvanquishable number \u2014 \n\nShake your chains to earth like dew \nWhich in sleep has fallen on you \u2014 \n\nYe are many, they are few. \n\n Taken from The Mask of Anarchy. \n\n \n\n\nTHE VICTORY \n\nThose were the followers, the Indian civil resisters in South \nAfrica. \n\nIn , the Indian population of South Africa was a quarter of \na million, of whom two hundred thousand lived in the province \nof Natal. Though they had multiplied and prospered, they still \ndid not have the franchise or guaranteed civil rights. They were \nsubject to white and Zulu violence. Their condition was precar\u00ac \nious. Manilal Gandhi\u2019s Indian Opinion of February th, , \nnoted that in  passive resistance was \u2018only suspended\u2019 and \n\u2018may have to be reintroduced\u2019. Every generation re-enacts the \nbattle for ita rights \u2014 or it loses them. But while individuals in \nseveral continents have practised passive resistance, nobody \nexcept Mohandas K. Gandhi has ever led a successful, non-violent, \nmass, civil disobedience campaign. He possessed the personal \nqualities which aroused the necessary qualities in the community.  CHAPTER I \n\n\nHOME IN INDIA \n\nD o I contradict myself?\u2019 Gandhi asked. \u2018Consistency is a \nhobgoblin.\u2019 No ism held him rigid in its grip. No theory \nguided his thoughts or actions. He strove to keep his mind \nopen. He reserved the right to differ with himself. \n\nHis life, Gandhi said, was an unending experiment. He \nexperimented even in his seventies. There was nothing set \nabout him. He was not a conforming Hindu nor a conforming \nnationalist nor a conforming pacifist. \n\nGandhi was independent, unfettered, unpredictable, hence \nexciting and difficult. A conversation with him was a voyage of \ndiscovery: he dared to go anywhere without a chart. \n\nUnder attack, he rarely defended himself. Happily adjusted in \nIndia, he never condemned anyone. Humble and simple, he did \nnot have to pretend dignity. Thus relieved of uncreative mental \ntasks, he was free to be creative. \n\nNor did he say or do anything merely to gain popularity or win \nor mollify followers. He upset the applecart frequently. His \ninner need to perform a given act took precedence over its \npossible effects on his supporters. \n\nTwo days before Gandhi, Mrs. Gandhi and Kallenbach \nreached England from South Africa, the first World War broke \nout. Gandhi felt that Indians ought to do their bit for Britain. \nHe accordingly volunteered to raise an ambulance corps headed \nby himself. Eighty Indians, most of them university students in \nthe United Kingdom, volunteered. Gandhi had no delusions: \n\u2018Those who confine themselves to attending to the wounded in \nbattle cannot be absolved from the guilt of war.\u2019 \n\nThen how, Gandhi\u2019s friends protested, could he, the man of non\u00ac \nviolence, participate in a war? \n\nGandhi answered in effect: I accept the benefits and protection \nof the British Empire; I have not tried to destroy it; why should I \nallow it to be destroyed? \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nA modern nation is only quantitatively less violent in peace-time \nthan in war-time and unless one non-collaborates in peace-time one \nis merely salving one\u2019s conscience by non-collaborating in war\u00ac \ntime. Why pay taxes to make the arms which kill? Why obey \nthe kind of officials who will make a war? Unless you surrender \ncitizenship or go to jail before the war, you belong in the army \nduring the war. \n\nGandhi\u2019s support of the war was personally painful and politic\u00ac \nally harmful. But he preferred truth to comfort. \n\nWhile the minor tempest over his pro-war attitude raged \naround Gandhi\u2019s head, his pleurisy, aggravated by too much \nfasting, took a serious turn and the doctor ordered him home to \nIndia. He arrived in Bombay with Kasturbai on January th, \n. Kallenbach, being a German, was not permitted to travel \nto India and returned to South Africa. \n\nExcept in his native Gujarat region, in the cities of Bombay and \nCalcutta and in f the Madras area, home of the many Tamil \nindentured labourers in South Africa, Gandhi\u2019s support of the \nwar made little impression. He was not well known in India. \nNor did he know India. \n\nProfessor Gokhale accordingly \u2018commanded\u2019 Gandhi to spend \nthe first year in India with \u2018his ears open but his mouth shut\u2019. \nWhat he learned in those twelve months about the past and \npresent, Gandhi matched against the hopes for the future which \nhe had formulated as early as  in his first book, Hind Swaraj \nor Indian Home Rule. He wrote this brief volume in Gujarati, using \nright and left hands to do so, while returning from England to \nSouth Africa, and had it published in instalments in Indian Opinion \nand then printed as a book in Gujarati and English. He allowed \nit to be republished in India in  without change and, in an \nintroduction to still another edition in , he said, \u2018I have seen \nnothing to make me alter the views expanded in it.\u2019 The seventy- \nsix-page pamphlet, therefore, stands as his social credo. \n\nIndian Home Rule records discussions Gandhi had with Indians \nin London, one of them an anarchist, some of them terrorists. \u2018If \nwe act justly,\u2019 Gandhi said to them, \u2018India will be free sooner. \nYou will see, too, that if we shun every Englishman as an enemy, \nHome Rule will be delayed. But if we are just to them, we shall \nreceive their support. . .\u2019 This was prophetic. \n\n \n\n\nHOME IN INDIA \n\n\nGandhi asked his interlocutors, whom he groups as \u2018Reader\u2019, \nhow they see the future independence of India. \u2018As is Japan,\u2019 \nReader replies, \u2018so must India be. We must own our own navy, \nour army and we must have our own splendour and then will \nIndia\u2019s voice ring through the world.\u2019 \n\nIn other words, Gandhi comments, you want \u2018English rule \nwithout the Englishman. You want the tiger\u2019s nature without the \ntiger . . . You would make India English . . . This is not the \nSwaraj I want.\u2019 \n\nGokhale told Gandhi in South Africa that the booklet was \n\u2018crude and hastily conceived\u2019. Some parts, notably those on \nBritish domestic politics, are. On the other hand, Count Leo \nTolstoy praised its philosophy. It has abiding interest for Gandhi\u2019s \ndefinition of Swaraj or home-rule. \u2018Some Englishmen\u2019, Gandhi \nwrote, \u2018state that they took and hold India by the sword. Both \nstatements are wrong. The sword is entirely useless for holding \nIndia. We alone keep them . . . We like their commerce; they \nplease us by their subtle methods and get what they want from \nus . . . We further strengthen their hold by quarrelling amongst \nourselves . . . India is being ground down not under the British \nheel but under that of modern civilization.\u2019 Then he inveighed \nagainst India\u2019s use of railways and machinery. \n\nForeigners, and Indians, frequently challenged Gandhi on his \nhostility to the modern machine. The several editions of Hind \nSwaraj report some of these discussions. In , for instance, \nGandhi was asked whether he objected to all machinery. \n\n\u2018How can I,\u2019 he replied, \u2018when I know that even this body \nis a most delicate piece of machinery? The spinning wheel is a \nmachine; a little toothpick is a machine. What I object to is the \ncraze for machinery, not machinery as such. \n\n\u2018Today,\u2019 Gandhi continued, \u2018machinery merely helps a few to \nride on the back of the millions . . . The machine should not tend \nto atrophy the limbs of man. For instance, I would make intellig\u00ac \nent exceptions. Take the case of the Singer sewing machine. It \nis one of the few useful things ever invented and there is a romance \nabout the device itself.\u2019 He had learned to sew on it. \n\nAnd would you not need big factories to produce little devices \nlike Singers? \n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Gandhi agreed. \n\n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nThen, since he liked to close the circle of every argument and \ncome back to his starting-point, Gandhi said, \u2018Ideally, I would \nrule out all machinery, even as I would reject this very body, \nwhich is not helpful to salvation and seek the absolute liberation \nof the soul. From that point of view I would reject all machinery, \nbut machines would remain because, like the body, they are \ninevitable.\u2019 Thus he upheld the. principle yet admitted the \ncontention. \n\nGandhi was not anti-machine. He merely realized earlier than \nmany others the dangers and horrors of a civilization in which \nthe individual is somewhat in the position of a savage who makes \nan idol and then makes sacrifices to appease it. The faster \nmachines move the faster man lives and the greater his nervous \ntensions and his cultural and social tributes to speed. Gandhi \nwould have had less objection to machinery if it merely served the \nbody; he did not want it to invade the mind and maim the spirit. \nHe believed that India\u2019s mission was to \u2018elevate the moral being\u2019. \nTherefore, \u2018if the English become Indianized we can accom\u00ac \nmodate them\u2019. \n\nSuch a thing has never happened, Reader objected. \n\n\u2018To believe that what has not occurred in history will not occur \nat all,\u2019 Gandhi replied, \u2018is to argue disbelief in the dignity of man.\u2019 \nHe had the soul of an Eastern prophet and the spirit of a Western \npioneer. \n\nReader scorned Gandhi\u2019s moral preoccupations. He wanted \nIndia liberated from the British as Mazzini and Garibaldi had \nliberated Italy from Austria. The analogy enabled Gandhi to \ndrive home the central thesis that guided him to greatness before \nand especially after India\u2019s independence: \n\n\u2018If you believe that because Italians rule Italy the Italian nation \nis happy you are groping in darkness . . . According to Mazzini \n[freedom] meant the whole of the Italian people, that is, its \nagriculturists. The Italy of Mazzini still remains in a state of \nslavery. . . . \n\n\u2018It would be folly to assume,\u2019 Gandhi added, \u2018that an Indian \nRockefeller would be better than an American Rockefeller.\u2019 \n\nGandhi saw the flaws in Western culture, but he took much \nfrom it. His defence of the individual against the community \nand of man against the machine is in tune with Ruskin, Thoreau, \n\n \n\n\nHOME IN INDIA \n\n\nMazzini and the Utopian (not Marxist) socialists. Ideologically, \nGandhi stood with one foot in the deep individualistic current of \nthe first half of Europe\u2019s nineteenth century and the other in the \nturbulent nationalistic current of the second half of that century; \nthe two streams merged in him and he endeavoured to achieve \nthe same synthesis in the Indian independence movement. \n\nGandhi asked England to quit India, but he did not want India \nto quit England. He cultivated cultural and other ties with \nBritain. In , for instance, he gave an Indian student named \nKamalnayan Bajaj a letter of introduction to Henry Polak in \nLondon in which he said, \u2018However much we may fight Great \nBritain, London is increasingly our Mecca ... I have advised \nhim to take up a course in the London School of Economics.\u2019 His \nnationalism lacked the usual concomitants of nationalism: \nexclusiveness and hostility towards other countries. \u2018My patriot\u00ac \nism,\u2019 Gandhi declared, \u2018is subservient to my religion.\u2019 He was too \nreligious to serve one land, one race, one caste, one family, one \nperson, or even one religion. His religion was humanity. \n\nGandhi planted these ideas as he moved up and down India \nduring that probationary first year Gokhale had enjoined upon \nhim; he studied and learned, but contrary to orders he talked. \nHe talked at banquets celebrating his South African exploits. He \nattended them with the silent Kasturbai whom he lauded as his \nhelpful partner. \n\nAt a dinner in April , in Madras, he defended his recruiting \ncampaign for the British army; this speech was pro-West. \u2018I \ndiscovered,\u2019 he said, \u2018that the British Empire had certain ideals \nwith which I have fallen in love and one of those ideals is that \nevery subject of the British Empire has the freest scope possible \nfor his energy and honour and whatever he thinks is due to his \nconscience. I think that is true of the British government as it is \ntrue of no other government... I have more than once said that \nthat government is best which governs least. I have found that it \nis possible for me to be governed least under the British Empire. \nHence my loyalty to the British Empire.\u2019 \n\nHe took the unpopular side. \n\nGandhi\u2019s speeches were delivered in a weak, unimpressive, \nconversational tone. He had been heralded as the hero of Natal \nand the Transvaal, the person who defeated Smuts. The Indian \n\ni \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nnationalists had expected a new giant, a lion of a man who might \nlead them to independence. (Gokhale died in .) They were \ndisappointed. Instead of a likely candidate for the succession, they \nsaw a thin little figure dressed in a ridiculously large turban and \nflapping loincloth who could scarcely make himself heard (there \nwere no loudspeakers) and neither thrilled nor stimulated his \naudience. \n\nYet Gandhi would soon remake the entire nationalist movement \nof India. \n\nSimultaneously with Gandhi\u2019s departure from Phoenix Farm, \nhis own family, with other families, also left South Africa for \nIndia. As the best place for the temporary sojourn of the boys in \nthis group Gandhi chose Shantiniketan, a school in Bengal, \neastern India, maintained by Rabindranath Tagore, India\u2019s \ngreat novelist and poet laureate who won the Nobel Prize for \nLiterature in . \n\nGandhi and Tagore were contemporaries and closely linked as \nchief agents of India\u2019s twentieth-century regeneration. But \nGandhi was the wheat field and Tagore the rose garden, Gandhi \nwas the working arm, Tagore the singing voice, Gandhi the \ngeneral, Tagore the herald, Gandhi the emaciated ascetic with \nshaven head and face, Tagore the large, white-maned, white- \nbearded aristocrat-intellectual with a face of classic, patriarchal \nbeauty. Gandhi exemplified stark renunciation; Tagore felt \u2018the \nembrace of freedom in a thousand bonds of delight\u2019. Yet both \nwere united by their love of India and mankind. Tagore wept \nat seeing his India \u2018the eternal ragpicker at other people\u2019s dust\u00ac \nbins\u2019 and prayed for \u2018the magnificent harmony of all human races\u2019. \n\nTagore believed, with Gandhi, that India\u2019s shackles were self- \nmade: \n\nPrisoner, tell me who was it that wrought this unbreakable \nchain? \n\nIt was I, said the prisoner, who forged this chain very carefully. \n\nTagore and Gandhi, the greatest Indians of the first half of the \ntwentieth century, revered one another. It was Tagore, appar\u00ac \nently, who conferred on Gandhi the title of Mahatma; \u2018The Great \nSoul in beggar\u2019s garb,\u2019 Tagore Said. Gandhi called Tagore \u2018The \nGreat Sentinel\u2019. Sentimentally inseparable, soulmates to the end, \n\n \n\n\nHOME IN INDIA \n\n\nthey waged verbal battles, for they were different. Gandhi faced \nthe past and out of it made future history; religion, caste, Hindu \nmythology were deeply ingrained in him. Tagore accepted the \npresent, with its machines, its Western culture and, despite it, \nmade Eastern poetry. Perhaps, since provincial origins are so \nimportant in India, it was the difference between isolated Gujarat \nand cosmopolitan Bengal. Gandhi was frugal. Tagore was \nprodigal. \u2018The suffering millions\u2019, Gandhi wrote to Tagore, \u2018ask \nfor one poem, invigorating food.\u2019 Tagore gave them music. At \nShantiniketan, Tagore\u2019s pupils sang and danced, wove garlands \nand made life sweet and beautiful. When Gandhi arrived there, \nshortly after his return to India, to see how his Phoenix Farm boys \nwere faring, he turned the place upside down. With the help of \nCharles Freer Andrews and William W. Pearson, his friends in \nSouth Africa, Gandhi persuaded the entire community of  \nboys and their teachers to run the kitchen, handle the garbage, \nclean the latrines, sweep the grounds and, in general, forsake the \nmuse for the monk. Tagore acquiesced tolerantly and said, \u2018The \nexperiment contains the key to Swaraj\u2019 or home-rule. But austerity \nwas uncongenial and, when Gandhi left to attend Gokhale\u2019s \nfuneral, the experiment collapsed. \n\nGandhi, however, sought his own hermitage or ashram where \nhe, his family and friends and nearest co-workers would make their \npermanent home in an atmosphere of renunciation and service. \nGandhi\u2019s life now had no room for private law practice or private \nrelations with wife and sons. A foreigner once said to Gandhi, \n\u2018How is your family?\u2019 \n\n\u2018All of India is my family,\u2019 Gandhi replied. \n\nThus dedicated, Gandhi founded the Satyagraha Ashram first \nat Kochrab and then, permanently, at Sabarmati, across the \nSabarmati River from the city of Ahmedabad. There, rooted in \nthe soil and sand and people of India, Gandhi grew to full stature \nas the leader of his nation. \n\nAhmedabad\u2019s textile magnates and Bombay\u2019s shipping barons \nsupported financially the inmates of Gandhi\u2019s ashram. The \nSabarmati Ashram consists of a group of low, whitewashed \nhuts in a grove of spreading trees. A mile away stands the \nSabarmati prison where fighters for India\u2019s freedom were later \nincarcerated. Below the ashram compound is the river in which \n\nk m.g.  \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nwomen wash their laundry, and cows and buffaloes wade. All \naround, the scene is gently pastoral, but not too distant are the \nclosely packed houses of Ahmedabad hedged in by ugly factory \nsmokestacks. \n\nGandhi\u2019s room is about the size of a cell; its one window has \niron bars. The room opens on to a small terrace where Gandhi \nslept even in the coldest nights and worked during the day. Except \nfor intervals in prison, Gandhi occupied that cell for sixteen years. \n\nOn the high bank which slopes down sharply to the river, \nGandhi held his daily prayer meetings. Near by is the grave of \nMaganlal Gandhi, the Mahatma\u2019s second cousin, who managed \nthe ashram and died in . \u2018His death has widowed me. M. K. \nGandhi\u2019, reads the inscription on the stone. \n\nWith the years, new houses were erected to accommodate the \nIndians who wished to be Gandhi\u2019s disciples. Some of the most \nactive leaders of the independence movement began their political \ncareers at the feet of the Mahatma in Sabarmati. The population \nof the settlement fluctuated from  at the start to a maximum of \n. They tended the fruit trees, planted grain, spun, wove, \nstudied and taught in surrounding villages. \n\nIn ancient India, ashrams and religious retreats for monks \nwere well-known phenomena. Pilgrimages to four ashrams in \ndifferent parts of the land signified that one\u2019s legs had proved the \nunity of India. Ashramites resigned from the world and, con\u00ac \ntemplating themselves inside and out, waited for the end while \ntorturing the body to hasten it. Gandhi and his ashram, however, \nremained in closest contact with the world. The ashram, in fact, \nbecame the navel of India. Contemplating the ashram, Indians \nattached themselves to its first citizen. Nor did Gandhi ever \npurposely hurt his body. He had it massaged; he slept adequately; \nhe walked for strength; all his dietetic aberrations, queer to many \nWesterners and even to many Indians, were designed to make him \na biologically perfect instrument for the attainment of spiritual \ngoals. Though he drastically reduced his food consumption he did \nnot want to be famished, and in South Africa he always carried \nchocolate-coated almonds to still sudden hunger. He remained, \nuntil he was killed, a healthy specimen. Who but a very \nhealthy man could have fasted as often and as long as he did yet \nreach the age of seventy-eight? \n\n \n\n\nHOME IN INDIA \n\n\nA photograph taken shortly after his return to India shows him \nseated on a platform, legs crossed, nude but for a short loincloth, \nmaking a speech while around him stand Indian politicians in \nEuropean clothes. He soon told them to shed those garments. \nHow could persons in Bond Street suits or Bombay coats and \ntrousers win peasant support? \n\nPeasants? Politicians had nothing to do with peasants. They \nwere hoping to persuade the British to withdraw or, at least, to \nameliorate the imperial regime; to achieve this end you either had \nto shoot well or appear in striped trousers to deliver petitions in \nimpeccable English to English bureaucrats. India\u2019s Independence \nHall, they thought, would be papered with petitions and \nmemorials addressed to a most gracious sovereign or the sovereign\u2019s \nsatrap. \n\nBut Gandhi told them to get out among the people. To do so \nthey would have to drop English and use the native languages of \nIndia: Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannarese, \nBengali, Punjabi, etc., each spoken by many millions who had \nhad no benefit of Western education or perhaps any education. \nVillage uplift was Gandhi\u2019s First Freedom. Over  per cent of \nIndia lived in villages. India\u2019s liberation from England would be \nvain, he held, without peasant liberation from poverty, ignorance \nand idleness. The British might go, but would that help the fifty \nto sixty million outcast untouchables, victims of cruel Hindu \ndiscrimination? Independence must mean more than Indian \noffice-holders in the places and palaces of British office-holders. \n\nGandhi wanted a new Indian today, not just a new India \ntomorrow. \n\nGandhi\u2019s message touched India with a magic wand. Gradu\u00ac \nally, a new vision opened. The Indian\u2019s heart aches for the lost \nglory of his country. Gandhi brought it balm. Gandhi in loin\u00ac \ncloth, imperturbable, prayerful, seated amid trees, not aping the \nBritish gentleman but resembling a saint of antiquity, reminded \nthe nation that India had seen many conquerors and conquered \nthem all by remaining true to itself. Gandhi kindled India\u2019s \npride and faith. His magic wand became a ramrod. \n\nGandhi\u2019s message stood the Indian National Congress party on \nits head. \n\nThe Congress, as Indians call it, was born in Bombay on Decern- \n\ni \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nber th, . Its father and first general secretary was an \nEnglishman, Allan Octavian Hume, who had the blessing of \nLord Dufferin, the British Viceroy. Hume at first proposed that \nIndian politicians should meet regularly, under the chairmanship \nof British governors, as a grievance court, but the Viceroy \nthought that Indians would speak more freely if one of their \nnumber presided. Hume placed both proposals before prominent \nIndians and they chose the Viceroy\u2019s variant. This was the origin \nof the Congress. Hume remained secretary, sometimes alone, \nsometimes with Indian colleagues, until . The Congress \npresident for  was George Yule, an Englishman; for , \nAlfred Webb, an Irish member of the British Parliament; for \n, Sir Henry Cotton, a retired Indian Civil Service official; \nand for , Sir William Wedderburn, former Secretary to the \nGovernment of Bombay. Gandhi praised Hume and Wedderburn \nfor their devotion to India. They and all the Congressmen of this \nearly period saw India\u2019s welfare through constitutional reforms \nand administrative measures. \n\nThe Congress was organized to channel popular protest into \nlegal moderation. But into the channel flowed the fresh waters of \nnational revivalism, spurred, in the second half of the nineteenth \ncentury, by the Tagore family, Sri Aurobindo, Swami Vive- \nkananda, a dynamic, eloquent disciple of the mystic Ramakrishna, \nDadabhai Naoroji and Raja Rammohan Roy, the first translator \nof the Upanishads into English. The world theosophist movement, \nwhich paid permanent tribute to the ancient religious and cultural \nwealth of India, likewise fed that pride in the past which consti\u00ac \ntuted the foundation of the movement for national regeneration. \n\nThanks in part to the unification and orderly administration \nof the country by the British, Indian industrialists, Hindus and \nParsis in particular, grew rich and began to buy out their British \npartners. The emergence of Indian capitalism and of a new \nIndian middle class gave a powerful impetus to the urge for self- \ngovernment. \n\nUnder these multiple influences, the Congress slowly outgrew \nits collaborationist boyhood and became a demanding youth. \nThe \u2018prayers\u2019 to British governors were couched in firmer terms, \nthough as late as , Tagore complained of their \u2018correct \ngrammatical whine\u2019. Polite irritations supplanted polite invita- \n\n \n\n\nHOME IN INDIA \n\n\ntions to high imperial officials to attend Congress functions. \nSome speeches and resolutions pressed for ultimate home-rule. \nBut only a few \u2018extremists\u2019 dreamt of converting the Congress \ninto an active agent that would win Indian independence by \nmass action. \n\nGandhi too was a collaborationist when he returned to India \nin . Yet there was a revolutionary, anti-collaborationist \npotential in his yearning for an India that was Indian instead of a \nreplica of the West in clothing, language, mores and politics. \nGandhi craved for his country a cultural regeneration and spiritual \nrenaissance which would give it inner freedom and hence, inevit\u00ac \nably, outer freedom, for if the people acquired individual and \ncollective dignity they would insist on their rights and then \nnobody could hold them in bondage. \n\nThe national metamorphosis Gandhi envisaged could not be \nthe achievement of a small upper class or the gift of a foreign \npower. This made him conscious and critical of the shortcomings \nof the Congress. Before Gandhi sat securely in the saddle of the \nCongress he was the burr under the saddle, and it got him into \ntrouble. \n\n\nI  \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER III \n\n\n\u2018CHILDREN OF GOD\u2019 \n\n\u2018t* ndia,\u2019 Jawaharlal Nehru said, \u2018contains, all that is disgusting \nI and all that is noble.  Nothing it contains is more disgusting* \nJLthan \u2018the hideous system  , as Gandhi called it, of untouch- \nability, the \u2018canker eating at the vitals of Hinduism  . Orthodox \nHindus did not share this view, nor did they welcome Gandhi\u2019s \neffort to extirpate the evil. \n\nIn attempting to eradicate untouchability, Gandhi was tugging \nat roots several thousand years long. They originated in the \nprehistoric Aryan invasion of India and grew into the hearts, \nsuperstitions and social habits of hundreds of millions of people. \nMany Western nations have their \u2018untouchables  , but the stubborn \nHindu phenomenon of untouchability stems from peculiar historic \nand economic circumstances which are tied together into an ugly \nbundle by the sanction of religion. \n\nIn the long, unchronicled night before the dawn of history, a \nfair-skinned folk called Aryans inhabited an area north of India. \nPerhaps they hailed from the distant Caucasian isthmus between \nthe Caspian and the Black Sea, or from Turkestan, or even from \nthe more remote Russian valleys of the Don and the Terek where \nexquisite gold ornaments of the ancient Scythians have been un\u00ac \nearthed. Nehru notes that Pathan dancing resembles Cossack \ndancing. Six or seven thousand years ago the Aryans began \npushing south; one tide of the migration swept into India about \n or  b.c., another moved into Iran; a third descended \ninto Europe. \n\nHence, the \u2018Indo-European  language family. There is an \nevident bond between the Sanskrit of India and many Western \ntongues: Sanskrit pitri , Latin pater , Greek pater , English father ; \nSanskrit matri , Latin mater, Greek meter, English mother , Russian \nmat ; Sanskrit duhirti , English daughter , German Tochter , Russian dock. \n\nGradually, the Aryans, which means \u2018noblemen  , conquered \nnorth-west India. They found there an older civilization related \nto that of Babylon, Assyria and presumably Egypt. \n\ni \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nIn , at a place called Mohenjo-daro, about two hundred \nmiles north of Karachi, an Indian archaeologist, examining the \nruins of a comparatively new Buddhist temple seventeen hundred \nyears old, found, beneath the temple, proof of a much more \nantique city. Scientific excavations at the site brought to light a \ntreasure of clay seals, beads, bricks, pots, utensils and ornaments. \nOne jar had a Sumero-Babylonian inscription in the hieroglyphic \nwriting of Mesopotamia which dated it between  and  b.c. \nMany of the discoveries at Mohenjo-daro and other excavated \nspots in the same area resemble those at Ur of the Chaldees, Kish \nand Tell-Asmar in the region of the Tigris and Euphrates. \nExplorers have since traced the abandoned caravan routes over \nwhich north-west India and the Biblical Near East exchanged \ngoods and culture. \n\nWhen the silt, sand and debris were carted away, the town of \nMohenjo-daro, founded fifty-five hundred years ago and con\u00ac \ntinuously inhabited for six centuries, was exposed. It covers more \nthan  acres. One can now see its principal avenue, which was \nthirty-three feet wide, and many broad, straight north-south, \neast-west streets once lined with burnt-brick homes, two or more \nstoreys high, that had wells and bathrooms. A sewage system \nusing clay pipes helped to keep the city clean. \n\nIn a silver jar found under a floor lay a piece of cotton cloth, \nthe oldest in the world. Bronze razors, chairs, spoons, cosmetic \nboxes, silver drinking cups, ivory combs, bracelets, nose studs for \nwomen, necklaces, bronze statuettes showing that ladies wore \nskirts and girdles, gold beads, gambling dice, and thousands of \nother historic objects have been retrieved from the dust of ages \nin this most exciting unveiling of India\u2019s past. \n\nEither a flood or an epidemic destroyed this earliest-known \nIndian civilization. The Aryans brought their own gods and \ngoods and put a new stamp on the country. They used horses \nand chariots, battle-axes, bows and javelins. \n\nThe Rig-Veda, consisting of  hymns and written in liturgical \nSanskrit, pictures the life of these conquering Indo-Aryans four \nto five thousand years ago. Said to be the oldest book in the \nworld, the Rig-Veda reveals the origin of the Hindu caste system \nand of the untouchable outcasts. \n\nNo caste divisions, as far as can be ascertained, encumbered the \n\n \n\n\n\u2018CHILDREN OF GOD\u2019 \n\n\nAryans on their arrival in India. But conquest brought social \ndifferentiation. Though the subjugated territory was hardly the \nhome of barbarians, or blacks, the Rig- Veda speaks of the inhabi\u00ac \ntants contemptuously as \u2018black-skinned\u2019, \u2018noseless\u2019 and \u2018malignant\u2019, \nwho did not know enough to appease the gods with burnt offerings \nof animals. The Aryans employed these \u2018inferiors\u2019 to till their \nfields, tend their herds, barter their products and fashion their \ntools and ornaments. The merchants and farmers constituted the \nVaisya or third caste, the craftsmen the Sudra or fourth caste. \n\nPower and wealth sowed discord among the Aryans and they \ncalled upon a raja or king to rule over their several districts. He \nand his courtiers and their fighting men and their families consti\u00ac \ntuted the master-warrior Kshatriya caste who were served by \nhymn-singing, Veda- writing, ritual-performing, myth-making, \nanimal-sacrificing Brahmans or priests. Such was the ascendancy \nof religion and intelligence, however, that the Brahmans became \nthe top caste, while the Kshatriyas occupied the next rung down. \n\nThe Aryans, who entered India poor in women, intermarried \nwith the local population. This healthy mixing of the blood con\u00ac \ntinued even after the conquerors penetrated into south India where \nthey subdued the Dravidians. These races had evolved an interest\u00ac \ning culture of their own, but they were dark-skinned, and the \ncolour-conscious Aryans consequently increased the height of their \ncaste barriers. Dravidians became Brahmans, Kshatriyas and \nVaisyas, but a larger percentage than in the north were impressed \ninto the Sudra caste, and millions were left outside all castes. \n\nThe Aryan invasion frightened many natives into the hills and \njungles where they lived by hunting and fishing. In time, they \ntimidly approached the Aryan and Sudra villages to sell their \nwicker baskets and other handicraft products. Occasionally, they \nwere allowed to settle permanently on the edges of the settlements \nand do menial tasks, such as handling dead animals and men, \nremoving refuse, etc. These were the untouchables. \n\nSince modern times, vocation no longer follows caste. A Brah\u00ac \nman can be a cab driver, a Kshatriya a bookkeeper, and a Vaisya \na prince\u2019s prime minister. On the other hand, the ban against \nmarriage between castes is observed to this day, and when \nGandhi appeared on the scene in  few violated it. Indeed, \nthe four castes are divided into three to four thousand sub-castes, \n\ni \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nsome of them resembling craft guilds, others the equivalent of \nblood or provincial groups; and parents preferred to find a wife \nfor their son within the sub-castes. Marriage of a caste menjiber \nwith an untouchable was, of course, unthinkable. Love marriages \nwere considered rather indecent, certainly ill-omened. Marriages \nwere arranged by parents; and why would a father demean his \nfamily by admitting a pariah bride into it? \n\nUntouchables were confined to tasks which Hindus spurped: \nstreet-cleaning, scavenging, tanning, etc. In some regions, wheel\u00ac \nwrights, hunters, weavers and potters are considered untouchables. \nTo escape the humiliation, untouchables have adopted Chris\u00ac \ntianity or Islam. Yet forty or fifty million have chosen to stay in \nthe fold even though they are kept outside the pale. Why? \n\nTo perpetuate caste it has been clothed in the sacred formula \nof immutable fate: you are a Brahman or Sudra or untouchable \nbecause of your conduct in a previous incarnation. Your mis\u00ac \nbehaviour in the present life might result in caste demotion in \nthe next. A high-caste Hindu could be reborn an untouchable. \nThe soul of a sinner might even be transferred to an animal. An \nuntouchable could become a Brahman. \n\n\u2018The human birth\u2019, Mahadev Desai writes in his introduction \nto the Gita , \u2018is regarded by the Hindu as a piece of evolutionary \ngood fortune which should be turned to the best and noblest \naccount\u2019; then he quotes an old Indian poem: \n\nI died as mineral and became a plant, \n\nI died as plant and rose to animal. \n\nI died as animal and I was man. \n\nWhat should I fear? When was I less by dying? \n\nA woman might become a man in the next incarnation, and \nvice versa. Some Hindus would like to feel that at rebirth they \nwill still be members of the same family though their relationship \nmay be altered; a husband and wife may be brother and sister, for \ninstance, or sister and brother. Men with feminine propensities \nmight turn into women in the coming incarnation; a person who \nis bloodthirsty and vicious may fall to animal status; a spiritual \nmerchant may be reborn a Brahman. A greedy Brahman may \nbe reborn in the merchant caste. Thus conduct alters inheritance, \nbut once caste rank is fixed in any one incarnation it becomes \n\n \n\n\n\u2018CHILDREN OF GOD  \n\ndestiny. According to this doctrine, an untouchable is merely \ndoing penance; to interrupt it by raising his status robs him of a \npossible ticket to a high caste in the next incarnation. This pro\u00ac \nspect reconciles religious untouchables to their current misery. \n\nAn untouchable is exactly that: he must not touch a caste Hindu \nor anything a caste Hindu touches. Obviously, he should not \nenter a Hindu temple, home, or shop. In villages, the untouch\u00ac \nables live on the lowest outskirts into which dirty waters drain; \nin cities they inhabit the worst sections of the world\u2019s worst slums. \nIf, by mischance, a Hindu should come into contact with an un\u00ac \ntouchable or something touched by an untouchable he must purge \nhimself through religiously prescribed ablutions. Indeed, in some \nareas, this is incumbent upon him even if the shadow of an un\u00ac \ntouchable falls on him, for that too pollutes. On the Malabar \ncoast, untouchables are warned by a loud noise to quit the road \nand its immediate environs at the approach of a caste Hindu. \n\nHindus are expected to bathe once a day, and water for washing \nthe hands and private parts is available in the most primitive \ntoilets. Hindus also take special pride in the cleanliness of their \npersonal pots, pans and drinking vessels. A Hindu will smoke a \nhuka water pipe or a cigarette through his fist without letting it \ntouch his lips, and he often pours water into his mouth instead of \nsipping it. \u2018This sense of cleanliness\u2019, Nehru notes, \u2018is not scientific \nand the man who bathes twice a day will unhesitatingly drink \nwater that is unclean and full of germs . . . The individual will \nkeep his own hut fairly clean but throw all the rubbish in the \nvillage street in front of his neighbour\u2019s house . . .\u2019 Cleanliness, \nhe adds, is a religious rite, not an end in itself. If it were, Hindus \nwould be concerned with the cleanliness of others, untouchables \nincluded. \n\nUntouchability is segregation gone mad. Theoretically a device \nagainst contamination, it actually contaminates the country that \nallows it. Mahatma Gandhi knew this and he fought untouch\u00ac \nability for the sake of the castes as well as the outcasts, but in \nfighting it he defied a thousand taboos and roused a million fears, \nsuperstitions, hates and vested interests. Buddhism and many \nHindu reformers had attacked untouchability; Gandhi said little \nagainst it until he had taken action against it. \n\nIn his youth, Gandhi played with an untouchable boy. Putlibai \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nforbade it. Though he loved her he disobeyed her, his first re\u00ac \nbellion against authority. \u2018I used to laugh at my dear mother\u2019, \nhe wrote to Charles Freer Andrews, Tor making us bathe when we \nbrothers touched any pariah.\u2019 In South Africa, too, he associated \nwith untouchables. In May , in Bombay, he went to a \nmeeting called to improve the lot of untouchables. When he got \nup to deliver his address, he said, Ts there an untouchable here?\u2019 \nNo hand was raised. Gandhi refused to speak. \n\nNow there came to Gandhi\u2019s ashram near Ahmedabad an un\u00ac \ntouchable family and asked to become permanent members. He \nadmitted them. \n\nA tempest broke. \n\nThe presence of the untouchable father, mother and their little \ndaughter Lakshmi polluted the entire ashram, and how could \nthe wealthy Hindus of Bombay and Ahmedabad finance a defiled \nplace? They withdrew their contributions. Maganlal, who kept \nthe accounts, reported that he was out of funds and had no pro\u00ac \nspects for the next month. \n\n\u2018Then we shall go to live in the untouchable quarter,\u2019 Gandhi \nquietly replied. \u2022 \n\nOne morning a rich man drove up in a car and inquired \nwhether the community needed money. \u2018Most certainly,\u2019 Gandhi \nreplied. Gandhi had met the man only once and that casually. \n\nThe next day the anonymous benefactor put thirteen thousand \nrupees in big bills into Gandhi\u2019s hand and went away. That \nwould keep the ashram for a year. \n\nThis did not end Gandhi\u2019s troubles. The women of the ashram \nrefused to accept the untouchable woman. Kasturbai, revolted \nat the idea of having Danibehn in the kitchen cooking food and \nwashing dishes, complained to her husband. Gandhi heard her \npatiently and appealed to her reason. But belief in untouchability \nresides in some remote nervous recess where, with racial intoler\u00ac \nance, dogma and colour prejudice among its neighbours, it eludes \ncommon sense and humaneness. Gandhi therefore had to meet \nKasturbai on her own terms: she was a loyal Hindu wife; did she \nwish to leave him and go to live in Porbandar? He was responsible \nfor her acts; if he forced her to commit a sin it was his sin not hers \nand she would not be punished. Kasturbai was growing accus\u00ac \ntomed to her husband\u2019s strange ways. She could never refute his \n\n \n\n\n\u2018CHILDREN OF GOD\u2019 \n\n\narguments. He had become a Mahatma; who was she, the \n\nalmost illiterate Gujarat woman, to question the man of God? \n\nHe was now the loving teacher, no longer the lustful spouse. She \n\nresented him less and listened to him more. Within her nerve \n\n* \n\ntissue, to be sure, the hostility to the untouchables continued to \ntwitch. But her mind was gradually learning hospitality to his \nideas. In the worshipful air of India, husband became hero. \n\nPresently, Gandhi announced that he had adopted Lakshmi as \nhis own daughter. Kasturbai thus became the mother of an un\u00ac \ntouchable! It was like bringing a Negro daughter-in-law into the \npre-Civil War mansion of a Southern lady. \n\nGandhi insisted that untouchability was not part of early \nHinduism. Indeed, his war on the \u2018miasma\u2019 of untouchability \nwas conducted in terms of Hinduism. \u2018I do not want to be re\u00ac \nborn,\u2019 he stated, \u2018but if I have to be re-born I should be re-born \nan untouchable so that I may share their sorrows, sufferings and \nthe affronts levelled against them in order that I may endeavour \nto free myself and them from their miserable condition.\u2019 \n\nIf this prayer of the Mahatma has been answered he is now an \nuntouchable child in India and his devout followers might be \nmaltreating him. \n\nBut before being transformed into an untouchable in the next \nincarnation he tried to live like one in this. So he took to cleaning \nthe lavatories of the ashram. His disciples voluntarily joined him. \nNobody was an untouchable because everybody did the untouch\u00ac \nable\u2019s work without considering themselves contaminated thereby. \n\nThe outcasts were called \u2018untouchables\u2019, \u2018pariahs\u2019, \u2018depressed \nclasses\u2019, \u2018scheduled classes\u2019. Gandhi understood psychology; he \nbegan calling them \u2018Harijans\u2019 (Children of God), and later named \nhis weekly magazine after them. Gradually, \u2018harijan\u2019 was hal\u00ac \nlowed by usage. \n\nFanatic Hindus never forgave Gandhi his love of untouchables \nand were responsible for some of the political obstructions he en\u00ac \ncountered during his career. But to vast multitudes he was the \nMahatma; they asked his blessing; they were happy to touch his \nfeet; some kissed his footprints in the dust. They accordingly had \nto overlook, they forgot, that he was as contaminated as an un\u00ac \ntouchable because he did scavenging and lived with untouchables \nand had adopted an untouchable as his daughter. Over the years, \n\nl m.g.  \n\n\nM.G. \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nthousands of high-caste Hindus came to Gandhi\u2019s ashram to \ninterview him, to eat with him, to stay with him. A few un\u00ac \ndoubtedly purged themselves thereafter, but most of them could \nnot be such hypocrites. Untouchability lost some of its curse. \nGandhians began to use untouchables in their households; were \nthey better than their saint? He taught by example. \n\nCity life and industrialization have had the same effect of \nweakening the persecution of Harijans. In a village, everybody \nknows everybody else. But the untouchable does not look \ndifferent, and in a trolley or train the caste Hindu might be \nsitting skin-to-skin with a pariah and not realize it. Inescapable \ncontact has reconciled Hindus to contact. \n\nNevertheless, the poverty of the Harijans remained, and the \ndiscrimination against them was far from overcome by Gandhi\u2019s \nearly actions, gestures and statements in their behalf. He therefore \ncontinued his efforts unremittingly. \n\nWhy did it fall to Gandhi, rather than to somebody else, to \nlead the movement for the emancipation of untouchables? \n\nMany of the indentured labourers in South Africa were un\u00ac \ntouchables, and they were the heroes of the final phase of the civil \ndisobedience campaign in . Gandhi\u2019s twenty-year struggle \nin South Africa, moreover, was directed against an evil which, \nwith all its economic overtones, was at bottom a colour prejudice. \nAll men are born with unequal gifts but equal rights, and society \nowes them an equal or at least unimpeded opportunity to develop \ntheir native abilities and live in liberty. How could Gandhi, fresh \nfrom his fight for the equality of Indians in South Africa, coun\u00ac \ntenance a cruel inequality imposed by Indians on other Indians \nin India? \n\nThe foundations of freedom are sapped where anybody is denied \nequal rights because of his religion, the beliefs and deeds of his \nancestors or relatives, the shape of his nose, the colour of his skin, \nthe sound of his name, or the place or estate of his birth. \n\nGandhi\u2019s concept of freedom for India excluded Hindu im\u00ac \nmorality as well as British administrators. \u2018Swaraj\u2019 or indepen\u00ac \ndence, he said in Young India on May th, , \u2018is a meaningless \nterm if we desire to keep a fifth of India under perpetual subjec\u00ac \ntion . . . Inhuman ourselves, we may not plead before the Throne \nfor deliverance from the inhumanity of others.\u2019 \n\n \n\n\n\u2018CHILDREN OF GOD\u2019 \n\n\nThe simplest explanation of Gandhi\u2019s attitude towards untouch- \nability is that he just could not stand it. In fact, he loathed this \n\u2018inhuman boycott of human beings\u2019 so much that he said \u2018if it \nwas proved to me that it is an essential part of Hinduism I \nfor one would declare myself an open rebel against Hinduism \nitself\u2019. No man who cared more for popularity than principle \nwould have made such a public statement in a country over\u00ac \nwhelmingly and conservatively Hindu. But he made it as a Hindu \nin an effort, he said, to purify his religion. He regarded untouch- \nability as an \u2018excrescence\u2019, a perversion of Hinduism. \n\nIn Hinduism, however, an excrescence is difficult to distin\u00ac \nguish from the essence. Hinduism is more than a doctrine and \nmore than a religion. Certainly, it is not a one-day-a-week \nreligion. It invades homes, farms, schools and shops. It is a way \nof life which meshes with the mythological prehistory, the history, \nthe economy, the geography and the ethnography of India. In \nIndia, religion is the sum total of the national experience. Islam \nis less absorbent, but Hinduism is a sponge religion, hospitable \nand without fundamentalism. \u2018We have no uncontradictable and \nunquestionable documents, no special revelations, and our scrip\u00ac \ntures are not final . . .\u2019 writes Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar, a \nHindu philosopher. Hinduism is simultaneously monotheistic and \nidolatrous, because it has, at different periods in history, drawn \nin populations that accepted one or the other. The monotheists \ntolerate idols and the idolaters dance before graven images but \npray to one God. Some Hindus sacrifice animals in their temples, \nand some hold it a religious duty not to kill a worm or germ. The \nreform movements of Hinduism, like Buddhism and Jainism, have \nnever broken away in schisms. They disappear into the general \nbloodstream. Hinduism is flexible, capacious, malleable. So is \nthe thinking of many Hindus. So was Gandhi\u2019s. He fought un- \ntouchability. He abhorred animal sacrifices; the flow of blood in \nthe house of God sickened him. But Hindus who perpetrated \nthese wrongs were his brothers and he was theirs. \n\nIndia, Nehru has said, is like a palimpsest. A palimpsest is an \nancient parchment or canvas which has been written on or painted \non and then varnished over at a later period and written on or \npainted on again and then varnished over and written on or \npainted on a third, fourth and fifth time. This economic use of \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nmaterials has unintentionally preserved some precious relics of \nthe past, and experts now know how to wash off the newer coats \nand reveal the old original inscriptions or drawings. The differ\u00ac \nence is that in the case of India, the varnish has, so to speak, dis\u00ac \nsolved, and all the words and figures of the several layers are \nvisible at the same time as one intricate jumble. This explains \nthe complexity of Indian civilization and of those Indians who are \npermeated by it. \u2018The human intellect\u2019, writes Sir Valentine \nChirol, \u2018has indeed seldom soared higher or displayed deeper \nmetaphysical subtlety than in the great system of philosophy in \nwhich many conservative Hindus still seek a peaceful refuge from \nthe restlessness and materialism of the modern world.\u2019 No Indian \ncan altogether escape this cultural-intellectual heritage. \n\nAt times, however, only one layer of the palimpsest is visible; on \nsuch occasions a modern, European-educated Hindu may vanish and \nbecome a worshipper of crude, primeval fetishes, even as a Western \nscientist may accept the irrational abracadabra of a desert cult. \n\nHinduism amalgamated Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, and \nBuddha who were regarded as atheists or agnostics. Many \nHindus accept Jesus and Mohammed as religious guides. Yet in \ninsane moments, Hindus, Sikhs and Moslems avidly slaughter one \nanother. Then they relax into apathetic tolerance. \n\nDespite its insatiable hunger for oneness, however, Hinduism\u2019s \n\u2018Live-and-Let-Live\u2019 only meant, \u2018Live separately\u2019. Hinduism has \nfostered endless division into self-contained villages, self-sufficient \njoint families comprising two, three, or even four generations in \none residence, and self-segregated castes and multitudinous sub\u00ac \ncastes whose members did not, until recent times, intermarry or \ninter-dine. God-fearing Hindus were content to see the \u2018children \nof God\u2019 in degrading isolation. \n\nYet the Indian ideal of unity in diversity remains. The binding \nfactors are the three legs of the subcontinent\u2019s compact triangle, \nthe unbroken line of culture from the dim past until today, the links \nof history and the bonds of blood and religion. \n\nBlood connects Hindus with Moslems and Sikhs. Religion \nweakens the connection. Geography connects; bad communica\u00ac \ntions divide. The multiplicity of languages divides. \n\nOut of these elements, Gandhi and his generation undertook to \nforge a nation. \n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER II \n\n\n\u2018SIT DOWN, GANDHI\u2019 \n\nU nder the impact of the first World War, the tide of \nprotest rose higher in India and even moderate Congress\u00ac \nmen began to ask for home-rule. In September , Mrs. \nAnnie Besant, a remarkable Englishwoman who has written her \nname permanently into the history of modern India, announced \nthe formation of a Home-Rule League and persuaded the veteran \nDadabhai to become its president. \n\nMrs. Besant was then approaching seventy. Born in , she \nhad lived a stormy life as atheist, socialist, women\u2019s rights advocate \nand theosophist. She regarded herself as a reincarnation ofHypathia \nof Alexandria and Giordano Bruno, both of whom met violent \ndeaths, and in her autobiography she says she longed to be the \n\u2018bride of Christ\u2019. Though a foreigner, she was an accepted and \nrespected leader of India. An eloquent speaker, trenchant writer \nand brave politician, she edited Indian publications and made \nIndia her home. She died in . \n\nIn , Mrs. Besant started a school at Benares, the holy city \non the Ganges, and in  this institution, guided by Pandit \nMalaviya, was expanded into the Hindu University Central \nCollege. An illustrious gathering of notables attended the three- \nday opening ceremonies in February . The Viceroy was \nthere and so were numerous bejewelled maharajas, maharanis, \nrajas and high officials in all their dazzling panoply. \n\nOn February th Gandhi addressed the meeting. It broke up \nbefore he could finish. \n\nIndia had never heard such a forthright, unvarnished speech. \nGandhi spared no one, least of all those present. \u2018His Highness, \nthe Maharaja, who presided yesterday over our deliberations,\u2019 \nGandhi said, \u2018spoke about the poverty of India. Other speakers \nlaid great stress upon it. But what did we witness in the great \npandal in which the foundation ceremony was performed by the \nViceroy [Lord Hardinge]? Certainly a most gorgeous show, an \nexhibition of jewellery which made a splendid feast for the eyes of \n\n* \n\n\n\u2018SIT DOWN, GANDHI\u2019 \n\nthe greatest jeweller who chose to come from Paris. I compare \nwith the richly bedecked noblemen the millions of the poor. And \nI feel like saying to those noblemen: \u201cThere is no salvation for \nIndia unless you strip yourselves of this jewellery and hold it in \ntrust for your countrymen in India.\u201d \u2019 \n\n\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 students in the audience exclaimed. Many \ndissented. Several princes walked out. \n\nGandhi was not deterred. \u2018Whenever I hear of a great palace \nrising in any great city of India,\u2019 he went on, \u2018be it in British \nIndia or be it in the India ruled by our great chiefs, I become \njealous at once and say, \u201cOh, it is the money that has come from \nthe agriculturists\u201d ... There cannot be much spirit of self-govern\u00ac \nment about us,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018if we take away or allow others to \ntake away from the peasants almost the whole of the results of \ntheir labour. Our salvation can only come through the farmer. \nNeither the lawyers, nor the doctors, nor the rich landlords are \ngoing to secure it.\u2019 Congress beware! \n\nGandhi* was unfurling his flag before the mighty ones of India. \nIt was the flag of the lowly. \n\n\u2018If you of the student world to which my remarks are supposed \nto be addressed this evening,\u2019 Gandhi declared, \u2018consider for one \nmoment that the spiritual life, for which this country is noted and \nfor which this country has no rival, can be. transmitted through \nthe lip, pray believe me you are wrong. You will never be able \nmerely through the lip to give the message that India, I hope, will \none day deliver to the world ... I venture to suggest t\u00b0 you that \nwe have now reached almost the end of our resources in speech\u00ac \nmaking and it is not enough that our ears be feasted, that our \neyes be feasted, but it is necessary that our hearts have got \nto be touched and that our hands and feet have got to be \nmoved. \n\n\u2018It is a matter of deep humiliation and shame for us,\u2019 Gandhi \ncontinued, \u2018that I am compelled this evening under the shadow \nof this great college, and in this sacred city, to address my country\u00ac \nmen in a language that is foreign to me. \n\n\u2018Suppose,\u2019 Gandhi mused, \u2018that we had been receiving educa\u00ac \ntion during the past fifty years through our vernaculars, what \nshould we be today? We should have today a free India, we should \nhave our educated men not as if they were foreigners in their own \n\ni \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nland, but speaking to the heart of the nation; they would be \nworking amongst the poorest of the poor, and whatsoever they \nwould have gained during the past fifty years would be a heritage \nof the nation.\u2019 \n\nThis sentiment provoked scattered applause. \n\nTurning to the essence of his philosophy, Gandhi, using words \nthat shocked the assembled aristocrats, said, \u2018No paper contribu\u00ac \ntion will ever give us self-government. No amount of speeches \nwill ever make us fit for self-government. It is only our conduct \nthat will fit us for it. And how are we trying to govern ourselves? \n\n. . . If you find me this evening speaking without reserve, pray \nconsider that you are only sharing the thoughts of a man who \nallows himself to think audibly, and if you think that I seem to \ntransgress the limits that courtesy imposes upon me, pardon me \nfor the liberty I may be taking. I visited the Viswanath Temple \nlast evening and as I was walking through those lanes these were \nthe thoughts that touched me ... I speak feelingly as a Hindu. \nIs it right that the lanes of our sacred temple should be as dirty as \nthey are? The houses round about are built anyhow. The lanes \nare narrow and tortuous. If even our temples are not models of \nroominess and cleanliness what can our self-government be? Shall \nour temples be abodes of holiness, cleanliness and peace as soon \nas the British have retired from India . . .?\u2019 \n\nGandhi stayed close to earth; even the most delicate ears should \nhear the facts of life. \u2018It is not comforting to think,\u2019 he said, \u2018that \npeople walk about the streets of Indian Bombay under the \nperpetual fear of dwellers in the storeyed buildings spitting upon \nthem.\u2019 Many Indian eyebrows were lifted. Was it right for an \nIndian to say this with Englishmen present? And what had spit\u00ac \nting to do with the Benares University or independence? \n\nGandhi sensed the audience\u2019s antagonism, yet he was relentless. \nHe travelled a good deal in third-class railway carriages, he said. \nConditions were not altogether the fault of the management. \nIndians spat where others had to sleep. Students misbehave in \nthe trains. \u2018They can speak English,\u2019 he commented sarcastically, \n\u2018and they have worn Norfolk jackets and therefore claim the right \nto force their way in and command seating accommodation ... I \nam setting my heart bare. Surely we must set these things right \nin our progress towards self-government.\u2019 \n\ni \n\n\n\u2018SIT DOWN, GANDHI\u2019 \n\nThe day\u2019s ration of unpalatable thoughts was still incomplete. \nThere remained the unmentionable. \u2018It is my bounden duty,\u2019 \nGandhi asserted, \u2018to refer to what agitated our minds these last \ntwo or three days. All of us have had many anxious moments \nwhile the Viceroy was going through the streets of Benares. \nThere were detectives stationed in many places.\u2019 A movement \nwent through the invited guests. This was not to be talked about \nin public. It was for Gandhi. \u2018We were horrified/ he revealed. \n\u2018We asked ourselves, \u201cWhy this distrust? Is it not better that \neven Lord Hardinge should die than live a living death?\u201d But a \nrepresentative of the mighty Sovereign may not. He might find it \nnecessary even to live a living death. But why was it necessary to \nimpose these detectives on us?\u2019 \n\nGandhi not only asked the unpalatable question. He gave the \nmore unpalatable reply. \u2018We may foam, we may fret,\u2019 Gandhi \nsaid about the Indian reaction to the detectives, \u2018we may resent, \nbut let us not forget that the Jndia of today in her impatience has \nproduced an army of anarchists. I am myself an anarchist, but \nof another type . . . Their anarchism ... is a sign of fear. If we \ntrust and fear God, we shall have to fear no one, not Maharajas, \nnot Viceroys, not the detectives, not even\u2019King George.\u2019 \n\nThe audience was growing unruly and arguments broke out in \nvarious parts of the assembly. Gandhi uttered a few more \nsentences when Mrs. Besant, who presided, called out to him: \n\u2018Please stop it.\u2019 \n\nGandhi turned around to her and said, \u2018I await your orders. If \nyou consider that, by my speaking as I am, I am not serving the \ncountry and the empire I shall certainly stop.\u2019 \n\nMrs. Besant, coldly: \u2018Please explain your object.\u2019 \n\nGandhi: \u2018I am explaining my object. I simply . . . \u2019 He could \nnot be heard above the din. \n\n\u2018Go on,\u2019 some shouted. \n\n\u2018Sit down, Gandhi,\u2019 others shouted. \n\nDecorum restored, Gandhi defended Mrs. Besant. It is because \n\u2018she loves India so well and she considers that I am erring in \nthinking audibly before you young men\u2019. But he preferred to \nspeak frankly. \u2018I am turning the searchlight towards ourselves . . . \nIt is well to take the blame sometimes.\u2019 \n\nAt this moment, many dignitaries left the platform, the commo\u00ac \n\nns \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\ntion mounted, and Gandhi had to stop. Mrs. Besant adjourned \nthe meeting. \n\nFrom Benares Gandhi went home to Sabarmati. \n\nDistances are great in India and communications bad; few \npeople can read and fewer possess radios. Therefore the ear of \nIndia is big and sensitive. In , the ear began to catch the \nvoice of a man who was courageous and indiscreet, a little man \nwho lived like a poor man and defended the poor to the face of \nthe rich, a holy man in an ashram. \n\nGandhi was not yet a national figure. The hundreds of millions \ndid not know him. But the fame of the new Mahatma was spread\u00ac \ning. India stands in awe of power and wealth. But it,loves the \nhumble servant of the poor. Possessions, elephants, jewels, armies, \npalaces win India\u2019s obedience. Sacrifice and renunciation win \nits heart. \n\nMatthew Arnold wrote: \n\nThe East bowed low before the blast \nIn patient, deep disdain. \n\nAnd it bowed low, with the same disdain, before the East that \ncoveted riches and might. \n\nThe Indian, therefore, understands as well as' appreciates re\u00ac \nnunciation. India has many monks and ascetics. But Gandhi\u2019s \nrenunciation caused a larger echo because he opposed renuncia\u00ac \ntion \u2018for the mere sake of renunciation\u2019. \u2018A mother\u2019, he observed \nin a letter, \u2018would never by choice sleep in a wet bed but she would \ngladly do so in order to spare the dry bed for her child.\u2019 \n\nGandhi renounced in order to serve. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER IV \n\n\nINDIGO \n\nW hen I first visited Gandhi in  at his ashram in Seva- \ngram, in central India, he said, \u2018I will tell you how it \nhappened that I decided to urge the departure of the \nBritish. It was in .\u2019 \n\nHe had gone to the December  annual convention of the \nIndian National Congress party in Lucknow. There were  \ndelegates and many visitors. During the proceedings, Gandhi \nrecounted, \u2018a peasant came up to me looking like any other \npeasant in India, poor and emaciated, and said, \u201cI am Rajkumar \nShukla. I am from Ghamparan, and I want you to come to my \ndistrict!\u201d \u2019 Gandhi had never heard of the place. It was in the \nfoothills of the towering Himalayas, near the kingdom of \nNepal. \n\nUnder an ancient arrangement, the Champaran peasants were \nshare-croppers. Rajkumar Shukla was one of them. He was \nilliterate but resolute. He had come to the Congress session to \ncomplain about the injustice of the landlord system in Bihar, and \nsomebody had probably said, \u2018Speak to Gandhi\u2019. \n\nGandhi told Shukla he had an appointment in Cawnpore and \nwas also committed to go to other parts of India. Shukla accom\u00ac \npanied him everywhere. Then Gandhi returned to his ashram near \nAhmedabad. Shukla followed him to the ashram. For weeks he \nnever left Gandhi\u2019s side. \n\n\u2018Fix a date,\u2019 he begged. \n\nImpressed by the sharecropper\u2019s tenacity and story Gandhi said, \n\u2018I have to be in Calcutta on such-and-such a date. Come and \nmeet me and take me from there.\u2019 \n\nMonths passed. Shukla was sitting on his haunches at the \nappointed spot in Calcutta when Gandhi arrived; he waited till \nGandhi was free. Then the two of them boarded a train for the \ncity of Patna in Bihar. There Shukla led him to the house of a \nlawyer named Rajendra Prasad who later became President of \nthe Congress party and of India. Rajendra Prasad was out of \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\ntown, but the servants knew Shukla as a poor yeoman who \npestered their master to help the indigo sharecroppers. So they \nlet him stay on the grounds with his companion, Gandhi, whom \nthey took to be another peasant. But Gandhi was not permitted \nto draw water from the well lest some drops from his bucket pollute \nthe entire source; how did they know that he was not an un\u00ac \ntouchable? \n\nGandhi decided to go first to Muzzafarpur, which was en route \nto Champaran, to obtain more complete information about con\u00ac \nditions than Shukla was capable of imparting. He accordingly \nsent a telegram to Professor J. B. Kripalani, of the Arts College \nin Muzzafarpur, whom he had seen at Tagore\u2019s Shantiniketan \nschool. The train arrived at midnight, April th, . Kripa\u00ac \nlani was waiting at the station with a large body of students. \nGandhi stayed there for two days in the home of Professor Malkani, \na teacher in a government school. \u2018It was an extraordinary thing \nin those days,\u2019 Gandhi commented, Tor a government professor \nto harbour a man like me.\u2019 In smaller localities, the Indians were \nafraid to show sympathy for advocates of home-rule. \n\nThe news of Gandhi\u2019s advent and of the nature of his mission \nspread quickly through Muzzafarpur and to Champaran. Share\u00ac \ncroppers from Champaran began arriving on foot and by con\u00ac \nveyance to see their champion. Muzzafarpur lawyers called on \nGandhi to brief him; they frequently represented peasant groups \nin court; they told him about their cases and reported the size of \ntheir fees. \n\nGandhi chided the lawyers for collecting big fees from the share\u00ac \ncroppers. He said, T have come to the conclusion that we should \nstop going to law courts. Taking such cases to the courts does little \ngood. Where the peasants are so crushed and fear-stricken, law \ncourts are useless. The real relief for them is to be free from \nfear.\u2019 \n\nMost of the arable land in the Champaran district was divided \ninto large estates owned by Englishmen and worked by Indian \ntenants. The chief commercial crop was indigo. The landlords \ncompelled all tenants to plant three-twentieths or  per cent of \ntheir holdings with indigo and surrender the entire indigo harvest \nas rent. This was done by long-term contract. \n\nPresently, the landlords learned that Germany had developed \n\n \n\n\nINDIGO \n\nsynthetic indigo. They thereupon obtained agreements from the \nsharecroppers to pay them compensation for being released from \nthe  per cent arrangement. \n\nThe sharecropping arrangement was irksome to the peasants, \nand many signed willingly. Those who resisted, engaged lawyers; \nthe landlords hired thugs. Meanwhile, the information about \nsynthetic indigo reached the illiterate peasants who had signed, \nand they wanted their money back. \n\nAt this point Gandhi arrived in Champaran. \n\nHe began by trying to get the facts. First he visited the secretary \nof the British landlords\u2019 association. The secretary told him that \nthey could give no information to an outsider. Gandhi answered \nthat he was no outsider. \n\nNext Gandhi called on the British official commissioner of the \nTirhut division in which the Champaran district lay. \u2018The com\u00ac \nmissioner,\u2019 Gandhi reports, \u2018proceeded to bully me and advised \nme forthwith to leave Tirhut.\u2019 \n\nGandhi did not leave. Instead, he proceeded to Motihari, the \ncapital of Champaran. Several lawyers accompanied him. At \nthe railway station, a vast multitude greeted Gandhi. He went to \na house and, using it as headquarters, continued his investigations. \nA report came in that a peasant had been maltreated in a nearby \nvillage. Gandhi decided to go and see; the next morning he \nstarted out on the back of an elephant. He had not proceeded \nfar when the police superintendent\u2019s messenger overtook him and \nordered him to return to town in his carriage. Gandhi complied. \nThe messenger drove Gandhi home where he served him with an \nofficial notice to quit Champaran immediately. Gandhi signed a \nreceipt for the notice and wrote on it that he would disobey the \norder. \n\nIn consequence, Gandhi received a summons to appear in \ncourt the next day. \n\nAll night Gandhi remained awake. He telegraphed Rajendra \nPrasad to come from Bihar with influential friends. He sent \ninstructions to the ashram. He wired a full report to the Viceroy. \n\nMorning found the town of Motihari black with peasants. They \ndid not know Gandhi\u2019s record in South Africa. They had merely \nheard that a Mahatma who wanted to help them was in trouble \nwith the authorities. Their spontaneous demonstration, in thou- \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nsands, around the courthouse was the beginning of their liberation \nfrom fear of the British. \n\nThe officials felt powerless without Gandhi\u2019s co-operation. He \nhelped them regulate the crowd. He was polite and friendly. He \nwas giving them concrete proof that their might, hitherto dreaded \nand unquestioned, could be challenged by Indians. \n\nThe government was baffled. The prosecutor requested the \njudge to postpone the trial. Apparently, the authorities wished to \nconsult their superiors. \n\nGandhi protested against the delay. He read a statement plead\u00ac \ning guilty. He was involved, he told the court, in a \u2018conflict of \nduties\u2019: on the one hand, not to set a bad example as a lawbreaker; \non the other hand, to render the \u2018humanitarian and national \nservice\u2019 for which he had come. He disregarded the order to \nleave, \u2018not for want of respect for lawful authority, but in obedience \nto the higher law of our being, the voice of conscience\u2019. He asked \nthe penalty due. \n\nThe magistrate announced that he would pronounce sentence \nafter a two-hour recess and asked Gandhi to furnish bail for those \n minutes. Gandhi refused. The judge released him without \nbail. \n\nWhen the court reconvened, the judge said he would not deliver \nthe judgment for several days. Meanwhile he allowed Gandhi to \nremain at liberty. \n\nRajendra Prasad, Brij Kishor Babu, Maulana Mazharul Huq \nand several other prominent lawyers had arrived from Bihar. \nThey conferred with Gandhi. What would they do if he was sen\u00ac \ntenced to prison, Gandhi asked. Why, the senior lawyer replied, \nthey had come to advise and help him; if he went to jail there \nwould be nobody to advise and they would go home. \n\nWhat about the injustice to the sharecroppers, Gandhi de\u00ac \nmanded. The lawyers withdrew to consult. Rajendra Prasad has \nrecorded the upshot of their consultations: \u2018They thought, amongst \nthemselves, that Gandhi was totally a stranger, and yet he was \nprepared to go to prison for the sake of the peasants; if they, on \nthe other hand, being not only residents of the adjoining districts \nbut also those who claimed to have served these peasants, should \ngo home, it would be shameful desertion.\u2019 \n\nThey accordingly went back to Gandhi and told him they were \n\n \n\n\nINDIGO \n\n\nready to follow him into jail. \u2018The battle of Champaran is won,  \nhe exclaimed. Then he took a piece of paper and divided the \ngroup into pairs and put down the order in which each pair was \nto court arrest. \n\nSeveral days later, Gandhi received a written communication \nfrom the magistrate informing him that the Lieutenant-Governor \nof the province had ordered the case to be dropped. Civil dis\u00ac \nobedience had triumphed, the first time in modern India. \n\nGandhi and the lawyers now proceeded to conduct a far-flung \ninquiry into the grievances of the farmers. Depositions by about \nten thousand peasants were written down, and notes made on \nother evidence. Documents were collected. The whole area \nthrobbed with the activity of the investigators and the vehement \nprotests of the landlords. \n\nIn June, Gandhi was summoned to Sir Edward Gait, the \nLieutenant-Governor. Before he went he met his leading associates \nand again laid detailed plans for civil disobedience if he should not \nreturn. \n\nGandhi had four protracted interviews with the Lieutenant- \nGovernor who, as a result, appointed an official commission of \ninquiry into the indigo sharecroppers\u2019 situation. The commission \nconsisted of landlords, government officials, and Gandhi as the \nsole representative of the peasants. \n\nGandhi remained in Champaran for an initial uninterrupted \nperiod of seven months and then again for several shorter visits. \nThe visit, undertaken casually on the entreaty of an unlettered \npeasant in the expectation that it would last a few days, occupied \nalmost a year of Gandhi\u2019s life. \n\nThe official inquiry assembled a crushing mountain of evidence \nagainst the big planters, and when they saw this they agreed, in \nprinciple, to make refunds to the peasants. \u2018But how much must \nwe pay?\u2019 they asked Gandhi. \n\nThey thought he would demand repayment in full of the money \nwhich they had illegally and deceitfully extorted from the share\u00ac \ncroppers. He asked only  per cent. \u2018There he seemed adam\u00ac \nant,\u2019 writes Reverend J. Z. Hodge, a British missionary in \nChamparan who observed the entire episode at close range. \n\u2018Thinking probably that he would not give way, the representative \nof the planters offered to refund to the extent of  per cent, and \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nto his amazement Mr. Gandhi took him at his word, thus breaking \nthe deadlock.\u2019 \n\nThis settlement was adopted unanimously by the commission. \nGandhi explained that the amount of the refund was less important \nthan the fact that the landlords had been obliged to surrender part \nof the money and, with it, part of their prestige. Theretofore, as \nfar as the peasants were concerned, the planters had behaved as \nlords above the law. Now the peasant saw that he had rights \nand defenders. He learned courage. \n\nEvents justified Gandhi\u2019s position. Within a few years the \nBritish planters abandoned their estates, which reverted to the \npeasants. Indigo sharecropping disappeared. \n\nGandhi never contented himself with large political or economic \nsolutions. He saw the cultural and social backwardness in the \nChamparan villages and wanted to do something about it im\u00ac \nmediately. He appealed for teachers. Mahadev Desai and \nNarhari Parikh, two young men who had just joined Gandhi as \ndisciples, and their wives, volunteered for the work. Several more \ncame from Bombay, Poona and other distant parts of the land. \nDevadas, Gandhi\u2019s youngest son, arrived from the ashram and so \ndid Mrs. Gandhi. Primary schools were opened in six villages. \nKasturbai taught the ashram rules on personal cleanliness and \ncommunity sanitation. \n\nHealth conditions were miserable. Gandhi got a doctor to \nvolunteer his services for six months. Three medicines were avail\u00ac \nable: castor oil, quinine and sulphur ointment. Anybody who \nshowed a coated tongue was given a dose of castor oil; anybody \nwith malaria fever received quinine plus castor oil; anybody with \nskin eruptions received ointment plus castor oil. \n\nGandhi noticed the filthy state of women\u2019s clothes. He asked \nKasturbai to talk to them about it. One woman took Kasturbai \ninto her hut and said, \u2018Look, there is no box or cupboard here for \nclothes. The sari I am wearing is the only one I have.\u2019 \n\nDuring his long stay in Champaran, Gandhi kept a long-distance \nwatch on the ashram. He sent regular instructions by mail and \nasked for financial accounts. Once he wrote to the residents that \nit was time to fill in the old latrine trenches and dig new ones \notherwise the old ones would begin to smell bad. \n\nThe Champaran episode was a turning-point in Gandhi\u2019s life. \n\n a \n\n\nINDIGO \n\n\n\u2018What I did*, he explained, \u2018was a very ordinary thing, I declared \nthat the British could not order me about in my own country,  \n\nBut Ghamparan did not begin as an act of defiance. It grew out \nof an attempt to alleviate the distress of large numbers of poor \npeasants. This was the typical Gandhi pattern: his politics were \nintertwined with the practical, day-to-day problems of the \nmillions. His was not a loyalty to abstractions; it was a loyalty to \nliving, human beings. \n\nIn everything Gandhi did, moreover, he tried to mould a new \nfree Indian who could stand on his own feet and thus make India \nfree. \n\nEarly in the Ghamparan action, Charles Freer Andrews, the \nEnglish pacifist who had become a devoted follower of the Mahat\u00ac \nma, came to bid Gandhi farewell before going on a tour of duty \nto the Fiji Islands. Gandhi\u2019s lawyer friends thought it would be \na good idea for Andrews to stay in Ghamparan and help them. \nAndrews was willing if Gandhi agreed. But Gandhi was vehe\u00ac \nmently opposed. He said, \u2018You think that in this unequal fight \nit would be helpful if we have an Englishman on our side. This \nshows the weakness of your heart. The cause is just and you must \nrely upon yourselves to win the battle. You should not seek a \nprop in Mr. Andrews because he happens to be an Englishman,  \n\n\u2018He had read our minds correctly,  Rajendra Prasad comments, \n\u2018and we had no reply . . , Gandhi in this way taught us a lesson \nin self-reliance.  \n\nSelf-reliance, Indian independence and help to sharecroppers \nwere all bound together. \n\n\ni \n\n\n \n\n",
    "1918-1922": " CHAPTER VI \n\n\nGOAT\u2019S MILK \n\n\u2018h\u201cT~ here can be no partnership between the brav.e and the \neffeminate. We are regarded as a cowardly people. If we \n\nJL want to become free from that reproach, we should learn \nthe use of arms.\u2019 \n\nMahatma Gandhi spoke those words in July , while \nrecruiting Indians for the British Army during the first World \nWar. \u2018We should become partners of the Empire,\u2019 he added; \u2018a \ndominion like Canada, South Africa and Australia. To bring \nabout such a thing,\u2019 he declared, \u2018we should have the ability to \ndefend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use \nthem ... If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest \npossible dispatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the Army.\u2019 \n\nGandhi delivered this speech in Kheda district of his native \nGujarat region in western India. In March, he had led a Satya- \ngraha movement in Kheda for the remission of taxes on peasants \nwho had suffered a crop failure. The civil disobedience campaign \nwas partly successful: the well-to-do farmers paid taxes but the \npoor did not. \n\nThe peasants had followed him in civil resistance and fed him \nand given him their carts for transportation. But now, when he \ncame to recruit, they would not even let him hire a cart and they \nrefused to feed him and his small party. \n\nGandhi records their heckling: \u2018You are a votary of non\u00ac \nviolence, how can you ask us to take up arms?\u2019 \u2018What good has \nthe Government done for India?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Partnership in the Empire is our definite goal,\u2019 he replied. \n\u2018We should suffer to the utmost of our ability and even lay down \nour lives to defend the Empire. If the Empire perishes, with it \nperishes our cherished aspirations.\u2019 \n\nHis audiences said India would fight in return for new free\u00ac \ndoms. No, Gandhi insisted, it was evil to take advantage of Bri\u00ac \ntain\u2019s war-time predicament. He trusted England. \n\nThe district had six hundred villages which averaged one \n\n  \n\n\nGOAT\u2019S MILK \n\nthousand inhabitants each. If every village gave twenty recruits, \nGandhi computed, that would make ,. \u2018If they fall on the \nbattlefield,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018they will immortalize themselves, \ntheir villages and their country.\u2019 In the same recruiting-sergeant \nlanguage, Gandhi asked the women to encourage the men. \n\nHis efforts failed and he only succeeded in making himself \nseriously ill. He had been living on peanut butter and lemons. \nThis slim diet and the exertion, plus, no doubt, the frustration of \nfailure, gave him dysentery. \n\nHe fasted. He refused medicine. He refused an injection. \u2018My \nignorance of injections was in those days quite ridiculous,\u2019 he \nsaid. He thought they were serums. \n\nThis was the first important illness in his life. His body was \nwasting away. His nerves gave way; he felt sure he would die. A \nmedical practitioner (\u2018a crank like myself\u2019, Gandhi called him) \nsuggested the ice treatment. Anything, as long as it was outside, \nGandhi said. \n\nThe ice helped. Appetite returned. The \u2018crank\u2019 suggested \nsterilized eggs with no life in them. Gandhi remained obdurate; \nno eggs. Doctors advised milk. But the cruel manner of milking \ncows and buffaloes had impelled Gandhi to abjure milk for ever. \n\u2018No,\u2019 he answered. \u2018I have taken a vow never to drink milk.\u2019 \n\nHere Kasturbai put in a stern word. \u2018But surely,\u2019 she said, \u2018you \ncannot have any objection to goat\u2019s milk.\u2019 \n\nGandhi wanted to live. He was not immune, he confessed, to \nthat \u2018subtlest of temptations, the desire to serve\u2019. Had he been up \nto par physically his will might have been strong enough to \nreject Kasturbai\u2019s suggestion. But the very fact that he could not \nresist the suggestion showed how badly he needed the milk. \n\nTaking milk, he wrote later, was \u2018a breach of pledge\u2019. It \nalways bothered him; it revealed a weakness. Nevertheless, he \ncontinued to be a goat-milk drinker to his last supper. \n\nKasturbai\u2019s insistence is the likely key to Gandhi\u2019s willingness to \nbreak the vow. Gandhi feared neither man nor government, \nneither prison nor poverty nor death. But he did fear his wife. \nPerhaps it was fear mixed with guilt; he did not want to hurt her; \nhe had hurt her enough. \n\nG. Ramchandran, a devoted Gandhian, has written a \u2018sheaf \nof anecdotes\u2019 about the master for which G. Rajagopalachari, \n\nm m.g.  \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nfather of Devadas Gandhi\u2019s wife and first Governor-General of \nindependent India, vouches as \u2018true\u2019. Ramchandran, who lived \nin Sabarmati Ashram for a year, recalls that one day, when \nKasturbai had cleaned up the kitchen after lunch and gone into \nthe adjoining room for a nap, Gandhi came to the kitchen and, \nbeckoning to a young male assistant of Ba, or mother, as Kasturbai \nwas called, told him in a whisper that some guests were arriving \nin an hour and would have to be fed. Putting a finger to his lips \nas he glanced towards Ba\u2019s room, Gandhi told the young man what \nto do and added, \u2018Do not disturb her . . . Send for Ba only when \nshe is needed. And mind you, don\u2019t irritate her. You will deserve \na prize if she does not go for me.\u2019 \n\nGandhi, writes Ramchandran, \u2018was a little nervous lest Ba \nshould wake up suddenly and burst upon him\u2019. So the husband \nleft the kitchen as quickly as he could, no doubt feeling a husband\u2019s \nrelief at getting beyond fury\u2019s reach. But Gandhi\u2019s hope of escap\u00ac \ning from his kitchen crime without detection crashed when a \nbrass platter fell to the floor. After prayers that evening, Ba, \narms akimbo, confronted the Mahatma; she had a fierce temper: \nWhy hadn\u2019t he awakened her? \n\n\u2018Ba,\u2019 Gandhi apologized, \u2018I am afraid of you on such occasions.\u2019 \n\nShe laughed incredulously. \u2018You afraid of me?\u2019 \n\n\u2018And yet that was the truth,\u2019 Ramchandran comments. \n\nIn his debilitated state during the dysentery, he was less than \never inclined to oppose her. Thereafter, for thirty years, Gandhi \ndrank goat\u2019s milk. \n\nGandhi\u2019s readiness to recruit for the British army was another \nweakness. I asked him about it in . \u2018I had just returned from \nSouth Africa,\u2019 he explained. \u2018I hadn\u2019t yet found my feet. I was \nnot sure of my ground.\u2019 He had come to the unbridgeable gulf \nbetween nationalism and pacifism and did not know what to do. \n\nHe might have taken the easy course and refused to support the \nwar. Most Indian nationalists did that. They said, India is not \nfree, therefore we will not fight. But this was naked nationalism \nhiding behind the transparent skirt of pacifism; it meant, if India \nhad self-government we would enlist to kill the enemy. \n\nThe issue Gandhi faced in  was universal and eternal: \nWhat does a citizen do when his country is invaded? For his \nconscience\u2019 sake, a pacifist may discommode his body and go to \n\n \n\n\nGOAT\u2019S MILK \n\n\njail, or he may bravely attack conscription and other military \nmeasures. This can be a valuable educational demonstration. \nSuppose, however, the entire nation emulated his example and \nrefused to fight? (Suppose the British had refused to fight in \n?) \n\nFor Indians in , two positions were possible. \n\nA  per cent Indian pacifist would have abstained from the \nwar and preferred perpetual colonial status, for as a colony \nIndia could deny war-time help to the enslaving motherland, \nwhereas India as a nation would have to prepare for war or face \ndestruction. \n\nGandhi could not take this position because he wanted a free \nIndian nation. \n\nA  per cent Indian nationalist would have abstained from \nthe first World War, saying it was Britain\u2019s war, but would have \nprepared to make war on Britain for the liberation of India. \n\nGandhi could not take this position because he still hoped for a \nnon-violent settlement with Britain about the future of India. \n\nIn , therefore, Gandhi compromised his nationalism by \naccepting the Empire and hoping to attain freedom gradually and \npeacefully; having done that, his compelling honesty forced him \nto compromise his pacifism and recruit for the war. \n\nThe political Gandhi was thus caught in the ineradicable con\u00ac \nflict between nationalism and pacifism. The religious Gandhi \ntried to resolve it by preaching and practising non-violence and \nthe universal brotherhood of man. \n\nIn this dichotomy lay the tragedies of Gandhi\u2019s life. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER VII \n\n\nTHE HISTORY OF BRITISH RULE IN \n\nINDIA \n\n\nhroughout the last thirty years of his life, from  \n\n\n\nto , Mahatma Gandhi fought three major battles: the \n\n\nJL battle with himself, the battle with Indians and the battle \nwith Britain. \n\nFrom remote antiquity to modern times, India has been invaded \ntwenty-six times. The British invasion was the last. Until the end \nof the fifteenth century, all of India\u2019s conquerors came overland \nand all, except Baber, approached through what is now Russian \nTurkestan, crossed the Hindu Kush where the passes are from \n, to , feet above sea level and then filed through the \nnarrow Khyber Pass to the Suleiman mountain range and the \nbanks of the Indus and beyond. \n\nSemiramis, Queen of Assyria, sent an army into India via \nTurkestan twenty-two centuries before Christ. Cyrus of Persia \nrepeated this performance in  b.c. North-west India remained \nunder Persian domination (Indians probably fought the Greeks \nat Marathon) until Alexander the Great of Macedon swept out \nof Greece at the head of an army of , men, quickly subdued \nSyria, Egypt and Palestine, defeated Persia at Arbela, marched \nto the Oxus and Samarkand and then, climbing the Hindu Kush, \nentered India in  b.c., at the age of thirty. After a nineteen \nmonths\u2019 stay, Alexander, a pupil of Aristotle, left for home, taking \nwith him several Indian philosophers. He died two years later \nin Babylon. \n\nThe Greeks, and subsequently the Romans, carried to the West \nthe achievements of Indian science. The so-called \u2018Arabic\u2019 \nnumerals were invented in India. The zero is an Indian concept. \nAn Indian brain likewise evolved the present world-wide system \nof numeral placement: the system whereby a one with a four after \nit is fourteen and a four with a one after it is forty-one. \n\nAttracted by the wealth and mystery of India, more fabled \n\n\n \n\n\nHISTORY OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA \n\n\nconquerors, Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Nadir Shah and others, \nadded their scratches to Indian history and withdrew with loot \nand lore. \n\nOn July th, , five years after Columbus in three Spanish \nvessels discovered America, Vasco da Gama in three Portuguese \nships, the largest of which displaced  tons, anchored off the \nsouth-west shore of India. Thus began the first seaborne invasion \nof India. \n\nThe Papal bulls of  and an agreement with Spain gave \nPortugal, then a world power, a Catholic monopoly in south\u00ac \neast Asia. That did not prevent the Dutch from establishing \nseveral lucrative trading posts in India early in the sixteenth \ncentury. The French followed a few years later. They sent home \npepper, cinnamon and other spices. \n\nEngland hesitated to encroach on the formidable Portuguese. \nInstead, since they had wool to sell which torrid southern Asia \ndid not need, the British searched for a north-west passage through \nNorth America and a north-east passage around northern Europe \nto the colder regions of China. But when this quest proved vain, \nEngland, emboldened by her victory over the Spanish Armada in \nJuly , dared to defy Portugal, Spain\u2019s confederate, and dis\u00ac \npatched her first expedition into the Indian Ocean in . \nDespite the war with Spain and Portugal, other British expedi\u00ac \ntions followed. The peace signed with these nations increased the \ntraffic and intensified the commercial competition. \n\nAn East India Company was formed in London in ; its \nrenewed charter of  gave it a British trade monopoly in Asia \nunlimited in time and space. \n\nWar greased the wheels of business. The Dutch, vigorous and \naggressive and supported by all the military might of the home\u00ac \nland, took the offensive against Portuguese settlements in India \nand, with British co-operation, achieved considerable success. In \n, an Anglo-Dutch fleet defeated the Portuguese. The victors \ndivided the spoils. \n\nIn ,, England abandoned the Dutch and became Portugal\u2019s \nally. As reward, British merchants won unhampered trade \nfacilities with all Portuguese possessions in Asia except Macao. \nTen years later, Britain went to war with Holland in Europe and \nAnglo-Portuguese forces fought the Dutch in India. At the \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\ncessation of hostilities in , Britain extended her power in \nIndia at Holland\u2019s expense. \n\nWars, intrigues with Indian provincial warlords, and shrewd \ntrading filled the coffers of the East India Company and en\u00ac \nhanced its power. In the first half of the seventeenth century, \nEngland was importing cotton piece-goods, indigo, drugs, lac, \nsugar and carpets from India. Indian calicoes were a special \nfavourite with British housewives. In return, the Company \nbrought to India broadcloth, industrial metals and gold. In , \nthe Company received from the British King the former Portu\u00ac \nguese possession of Bombay with its magnificent undeveloped \nharbour. With royal assent, a similar British position was estab\u00ac \nlished on the eastern coast at Madras. Feuds between the Moslem \nor Mogul emperors of India and the warlike Maratha Hindus of \nsouth-central India, in the area centring on Poona, east of Bombay, \nenabled the Company to proclaim the fusion of money-making \nand imperialism; it announced in December , that it proposed \nto create such civil and military institutions \u2018as may be the founda\u00ac \ntion of a large, well-grounded, sure English dominion in India \nfor all time to come\u2019. \n\nThe accretion of British power moved with accelerated speed. \nThe process was simple: early in , for instance, Prince Shahji, \nnative potentate of the state of Tanjore, on the south-east coast, \nwas dethroned by a rival; he offered the British a town called \nDevikottai at the place where the Coleroon River empties into \nthe Bay of Bengal \u2018on condition\u2019, says The Cambridge History of \nIndia , \u2018of their helping him to recover the throne\u2019. After a few \ndays of siege, Devikottai surrendered. \u2018The English kept it with \nthe country belonging to it; and as for Shahji,\u2019 the British \nchronicle notes, \u2018no one thought of restoring him to his throne.\u2019 \n\nAnybody wronged by the British was wooed by the French and \nvice versa. When Nawab Siraj-ud-daula, exploiting the dis\u00ac \nintegration of Mogul power at Delhi, took control of Bengal, the \nBritish tried to prevent him from getting too strong. In one \nindecisive skirmish he defeated a force of Europeans and im\u00ac \nprisoned some of them overnight in the Black Hole of Calcutta, \nwhere an unknown number perished. But on January nd, , \na young British officer named Robert Clive retook Calcutta and \nforced Siraj-ud-daula to accept humiliating terms. The nawab \n\n \n\n\nHISTORY OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA \n\n\naccordingly conspired with the French. The British Admiral \nWatson thereupon threatened him: T will kindle such a flame in \nyour country\u2019, the Englishman wrote, c as all the water in the \nGanges shall not be able to extinguish.\u2019 Sobered by these hot \nwords, the Moslem ruler shrank into a passivity that facilitated \nthe expulsion of his French allies from strategic Bengal areas. \nBut the nawab remained and so did some French advisers. An \ninsurrection, coinciding conveniently with the British attack, \nenabled Colonel Clive with  English and  mercenary \nIndian troops to rout the nawab\u2019s army of , at Plassey on \nJune rd, . Siraj-ud-daula was executed and his rival, \nnecessarily a complacent British puppet, replaced him. The entire \nprovince of Bengal was now a British colony. With a frankness \nborn of impunity, Clive wrote to Robert Orme, T am possessed \nof volumes of material for the continuation of your history, in \nwhich will appear fighting, tricks, chicanery, intrigues, politics \nand the Lord knows what.\u2019 It was all politics. \n\nWarren Hastings, the Governor-General of Bengal, continued \nthe policy of British expansion through armed force, enforced \ntributes and dynastic conspiracies. His trial in England, which \nlasted from February  to April , showed that the British \nadministration in India was neither scrupulous nor incorruptible, \nnor concerned with the welfare of Indians. \n\nGradually, by means mostly foul but considered normal in that \nage and place, the British established themselves throughout the \nlength and breadth of the vast Indian subcontinent. In some \nareas, the East India Company ruled directly through its officials. \nElsewhere it stood close behind the thrones of Hindu maharajas \nand Moslem nawabs who pliantly subserved the politics of British \nempire-building. \n\nThe Portuguese had been confined to a few ports. The Dutch \nhad been ousted. French power, though still considerable, was \nwaning. In , Mirabeau, the French revolutionary, urged the \nRussian Czar to help France by invading India. Napoleon\u2019s \noffensive against Egypt was conceived as the first step towards the \ndestruction of the British in India. When the Corsican\u2019s campaign \nin the eastern Mediterranean collapsed he wrote to Emperor \nPaul I in St. Petersburg urging him to march on India and \npromising men and supplies. Paul agreed and sent instructions \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nto General Orlov, ataman of the Don Cossacks. \u2018All the wealth of \nIndia will be yours as a reward for the expedition,\u2019 he wrote. \nRussia \u2018would acquire treasure and commerce and strike the \nenemy in the heart\u2019. The enemy was Britain. \u2018I am enclosing all \nthe maps I have,\u2019 the Emperor added. \u2018They go only to Khiva \nand the Oxus.\u2019 \n\nLater, Paul sent another map by special courier. General \nOrlov, however, never got beyond the Urals. Paul was myster\u00ac \niously murdered and the Russo-French alliance lapsed. But in a \nfew years it was renewed, and when Napoleon met Paul\u2019s suc\u00ac \ncessor, Alexander I, at Tilsit in East Prussia in , they planned \nan assault on India. There is a letter in the Russian archives \npenned by Napoleon to Alexander on February nd, , in \nwhich the Corsican proposed the formation of a Russo-French \narmy to conquer India. \u2018England will be enslaved\u2019, Napoleon \npredicted. He promised Stockholm to Russia as a reward for her \nefforts against England in Asia. \n\nThese were idle dreams. The French in India were soon limited \nto a few maritime dots and when, in , the British crushed the \ngreat Maratha empire in south-central India, the last organized \nchallenge to British rule vanished. The rest was a clean-up \noperation. \n\nWhile India was being subjugated, the invention of the spinning \njenny in , Watt\u2019s perfected steam engine in  and the \npower loom in  were converting England into a maker and \nexporter of textiles. Indian cotton goods were no longer wanted \nin Britain; on the contrary, Britain exported textiles and other \nfactory products to the people of India who, in , numbered \napproximately ,,. \n\nIndia\u2019s industries consequently languished; Indian treasure \nflowed to the British Isles as profit or plunder. Indian handicrafts \nsuffered too. India was transformed into a purely agrarian \ncountry whose villages, overcrowded by the influx of unemployed \ntownsmen, could not produce enough food. According to a \nBritish source, the deaths from famine in India between  and \n were one million; between  an d I ^\u00b0> four hundred \nthousand; between  and , fi ye million; and between \n and , fifteen million. \n\nEngineered by wit and violence, England\u2019s annexations in \n\n \n\n\nHISTORY OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA \n\n\nIndia in the latter part of the eighteenth century and the first \nquarter of the nineteenth left many disgruntled and dispossessed \nnative rulers. British attempts to introduce law and order and \nan equitable system of taxation further irritated innumerable \npersons nursing innumerable wounds. Widespread economic \nstringency intensified the general unrest. Only a spark was needed \nto produce a flame. India had not yet become totally docile, nor \nhad the British learned the technique, which they subsequently \nmastered, of firm yet smooth and barely visible administration. \n\nIt was , and a Hindu prophecy declared that on the \ncentenary of the Battle of Plassey in  British rule would \nperish. A war, officially called the Mutiny or the Sepoy Mutiny, \nbroke out. The immediate impetus was the distribution among \nIndian troops of British-made cartridges, greased with cow or pig \nfat, which had to be bitten before being loaded into rifles. Since \na Hindu must not touch cow fat and a Moslem must not touch \npork the provocation was perfect and Indian army units rebelled. \nBut the British authorities admitted that the Bengal Indian force \nwas \u2018a brotherhood\u2019 closely identified with the hungry villages, \nand the same bond connected all sepoys in British uniform with \nthe ragged, hungry peasants. \n\nNumerous regiments ro\u00a3e; one seized Delhi. Moslems took the \nlead, but all communities assiduously annulled innovations \nintroduced by the British. Rail and telegraph lines were cut. \nBoth sides committed numerous murders. Indian soldiers killed \ntheir British officers, and at Benares, \u2018rebels, suspects and even \ndisorderly boys\u2019, says The Cambridge History of India , \u2018were executed \nby infuriated officers and unofficial British residents who volun\u00ac \nteered to serve as hangmen\u2019. Much blood also flowed in pitched \nbattles and sieges. \n\nThe mutiny was unplanned, unco-ordinated, leaderless and \nhopeless. Inevitably, after many months, the British, aided by \nloyal Indians, suppressed it. With the restoration of peace, the \nEast India Company, \u2018upon which\u2019, according to The Cambridge \nHistory , \u2018all parties in England agreed in throwing the blame of \nthe Mutiny\u2019, was abolished. In , Queen Victoria assumed \nthe government of India and appointed Lord Canning her first \nViceroy. For eighty-nine years thereafter, until August th, \n, India was a colony of the British Empire. \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nThe blood-and-plunder period was ended. England\u2019s ideals of \nclean government filtered into the British administration of \nIndia. The British watered some deserts and improved com\u00ac \nmunications. Many British officials, after twenty or thirty years\u2019 \nservice in India, felt at home in India and like foreigners when \nthey went home to England. They were devoted to India. \nThey ate out their hearts and ruined their health coping with \ndifficult problems. \n\nThe British in India, however, were a fifth caste, the first caste. \nThey interdined with Indians perfunctorily and intermarried \nseldom. The British were the super-Brahman-Kshatriyas; all \nIndians were \u2018untouchables\u2019. The British were in India, never of \nIndia. They were like teachers who keep the class quiet and \nteach the children to read, write and reckon and to march in \ntwos, but who do not really teach the children anything, nor \nhelp them, because they regard themselves as animal trainers and \nthe children as nasty animals. \n\nThe British were masters in somebody else\u2019s home. Their very \npresence was a humiliation. Despite the best intentions of the \nbest among them, their every act was a humiliation. Then they \ncomplained, with pain, that Indians were \u2018ungrateful\u2019. The \ncomplaint was a measure of the lack of understanding. \n\nThe British never deciphered the palimpsest which is India. \nThey merely read the inscription on the surface: India was a \nweak, dirty, backward country, with some fine monuments to be \nsure, and some superior brains, but generally inferior, and Asiatic. \n\nEven if the British had converted India into a land flowing with \nmilk and honey they would have been disliked. Imperialism, like \ndictatorship, sears the soul, degrades the spirit and makes in\u00ac \ndividuals small the better to rule them. Fear and cowardice are \nits allies. Imperialism is government of other people, by other \npeople, and for other people. What the subjects gain, be it ever \nso great, is only the by-product of efforts on behalf of a distant \nmaster. \n\nThe requirements of British prestige hurt Indian pride. All \nthe visible manifestations of the British regime \u2014 the ceremonial \npomp, the isolated cantonments or villas where the British dwelt, \nand the use of English \u2014 told the Indians that they were a subject \nrace. Subjection stimulated a desire for liberation. \n\n \n\n\nHISTORY OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA \n\n\nThat is why colonial administration never is, and never can be, \nsuccessful. History has known no good colonizers. Every empire \ndigs its own grave. Imperialism is a perpetual insult, for it \nassumes that the outsider has the right to rule the insiders who \ncannot rule themselves; it is thus arrogant nationalism and \ninevitably begets an opposing nationalism. \n\nAlien rule thwarts the native lovers of power. The British \ncould never forget the Mutiny. \u2018After all,\u2019 Lord Linlithgow, the \nBritish Viceroy, said to me in , \u2018we are the occupying power. \nEver since the Mutiny we have hesitated to put arms into the \nhands of Indians.\u2019 Decades after the Mutiny, when the British \nwere secure enough in their power to share it, the share of Indians \nwas small. Real power \u2014 the authority to decide, appoint, recall \nand spend \u2014 lay with the British. No matter how high an Indian \nrose in the government service he remained a British hireling. \nHis power was not merely severely restricted; it lacked one of the \nsweetest concomitants of power: popularity; for the more the \nBritish trusted him the more his own people rejected him. \n\nUnloved and unwanted, the British found it dangerous to \narouse too many expectations of self-government and inconvenient \nto kill too many hopes for it. Hence, all the eighty-nine years of \nBritish rule constitute a series of oscillations between bold promises \nand disappointing performances. When the Queen took over from \nthe Company in  she announced that \u2018as far as may be\u2019 \nIndians would be given responsible posts in government. But \nLord Lytton, Viceroy from  to , wrote in a secret report, \n\u2018Since I am writing confidentially, I do not hesitate to say that \nboth the government of England and of India appear to me up to \nthe present moment unable to answer satisfactorily the charge of \nhaving taken every means in their power of breaking to the heart \nthe words of promise they have uttered to the ear.\u2019 \n\nThis was the complaint by a man who, unfettered by London, \nwould have done better. But the Indians naturally regretted the \nbreach of faith even more keenly than the Queen\u2019s first officer \nin India. \n\nWhen the demand for broader participation in local govern\u00ac \nment and for redress of grievances grew more insistent, Lord \nDufferin, Viceroy from  to , intending to direct upper- \nclass discontent into an artificial canal, sired the Indian National \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nCongress; subsequent Viceroys blessed it. Even if they had \nforeseen that a callow Indian law student in London in the late \ns would make Congress an instrument of the downfall of \nBritish rule, they could not have helped themselves. The history \nof the British rule in India is a record of retreats, more graceful in \nsome Viceregal quinquenniums than in others, but always \nenhancing Indian strength. Torn between their political sagacity \nand their power lust, the British yielded as much of the appear\u00ac \nance of power as circumstances required and as little of its \nsubstance as conditions permitted. \n\nMany times, for instance, Indians had been promised equality \nof employment in the I.C.S. (Indian Civil Service), which was \nthe British administration of India. \u2018After eighty-two years of \nequality,\u2019 H. N. Brailsford remarks sarcastically, Englishmen held \n per cent of the posts in the I.C.S. in . In ,*he declares, \nusing accepted figures, Indian participation was still only  per \ncent. \n\nJealous of her power, England feared the Indians. Conscious of \ntheir white skins and racial superiority, the British scorned the \nIndians. \n\nFear, and the administrator\u2019s natural wish to administer with \nmaximum facility, impelled the British to adopt the approved \nimperialistic tactic of Divide and Rule. Since the Moslems played \nthe leading role in the Mutiny and were thought to harbour \ndreams of empire, the British at first preferred the Hindus to the \nMoslems. When unrest and political ambition stirred the Hindus, \nthe British used the Moslems against the Hindus. \n\nSimilarly, Britain divided the country between British India, \ngoverned directly by England, and native India, governed in\u00ac \ndirectly by England but directly, and ostensibly, by Indian princes. \nIt was a cynical device, avowed as such by Lord Canning on \nApril th, i; he wrote, \u2018It was long ago said by Sir John \nMalcom that if we made all India into zillahs [or British districts] \nit was not in the nature of things that our empire should last \nfifty years; but that if we could keep up a number of native states \nwithout political power but as royal instruments, we should exist \nin India as long* as our naval supremacy was maintained. Of the \nsubstantial truth of this opinion I have no doubt; the recent \nevents make it more deserving of our attention than ever.\u2019 In the \n\n \n\n\nHISTORY OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA \n\n\ntwentieth century, these royal instruments without political power \nnumbered over five hundred and fifty. With that number of \npuppets the British thought they were secure. \n\nProfessor Rushbrook Williams, a brilliant Englishman who \noften served as official intermediary with Indian princes, wrote in \nthe London Evening Standard of May th, , \u2018The situations of \nthese feudatory states, chequerboarding all India as they do, are a \ngreat safeguard. It is like establishing a vast network of friendly \nfortresses in debatable territory. It would be difficult for a general \nrebellion against the British to sweep India because of this net\u00ac \nwork of powerful, loyal, native states.\u2019 \n\nNothing could be more clear. \n\nLest India become strong enough economically to break from \nthe Empire, and in order, too, to help British industries in the \nmotherland, Indian industries were discouraged and Indian \nshipping and shipbuilding were officially restricted. Education \nwas not designed to train a technical staff for industry nor a \nprofessional class to serve the country. With a population of \napproximately ,,, India, in , had only  \nstudents of agriculture,  of engineering,  of veterinary \nscience,  of technology,  of forestry and only  in medi\u00ac \ncine, in her colleges and universities, according to the official \nStatistical Abstract for British India . \n\nIn , India, with three times the population of the United \nStates and two-thirds the area, had , miles of railway track, \ncompared with , miles in the United States. India pro\u00ac \nduced ,,, kilowatt-hours of electric energy in ; \nthe United States, ,,, kilowatt-hours. \n\nThese conditions were not the sole fault of the British; Indians \nshared the blame. But Indians blamed everything on the British. \n\nIndians delight in criticizing, and autocrats detest criticism. \n\u2018All opposition\u2019, writes Sir Valentine Chirol, a British authority on \nIndia, \u2018even in the shape of criticism which it can treat as mere \nwaste of breath, is distasteful to an autocracy and apt to be \nregarded even as pregnant with sedition, and the British officials in \nIndia honestly believed in an autocratic form of government \nthough they tried to make it as paternal as possible.\u2019 \n\nBritish paternalistic autocracy irritated some Indians and \nembittered others. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nIndian terrorists began to operate in Bengal and other areas. \nTerror invited repression which provoked more terror. \n\nOne school of British politics wished to meet Indian hostility \nwith blood and iron; a second school wished to mollify it with \nreforms. Each of these had its counterpart inside the Indian \nNational Congress. \n\nThe British autocrats did not help the Indian moderates. Late \nin the nineteenth century, Field-Marshal Lord Roberts, well \nknown in India, said, \u2018It is this consciousness of the inherent \nsuperiority of the European which has won us India. However \nwell educated and clever a native may be and however brave he \nmay have proved himself, I believe that no rank which we can \nbestow upon him would cause him to be considered an equal by \nthe British officer.\u2019 \n\nSuch racialism bred implacable enemies and embarrassed the \nmoderates. The liberal lawyers, publicists and capitalists retained \ntheir control of Congress, but not everybody was in Congress. \nBoys were hurling bombs. Young men with degrees from Oxford \nand Cambridge were rejecting the West. East is East and West is \nWest, and if the twain cannot meet, they said, it is because East \nwas slave and West was master. \n\nIn Toward Freedom , an autobiography, Jawaharlal Nehru \nwrites that in , at seventeen, when he had just gone to \nCambridge from Harrow, he was an extremist. In fact, speaking \nof the Indian students, he says, \u2018Almost without exception we \nwere Tilakites or Extremists.  \n\nBal Gangadhar Tilak, known as \u2018Lokamanya  or \u2018Respected by \nthe People  , played a key role in the development of the Indian \nindependence movement and in Gandhi\u2019s life. \n\nTilak was a high-degree Brahman, a Chitpawan Brahman, \nfrom Poona in the land of the Marathas, the last Indian folk to be \nconquered by the British. The Marathas are highlanders who \nmany times in their history descended into the lowlands, notably \ninto Gandhi\u2019s homeland Gujarat, to dominate the less bellicose \npeoples of the plains. Once, these fighting Hindus captured \nMoslem Delhi; they remained foes of Islam. \n\nTilak inaugurated an annual festival to celebrate King Shivaji \n(bom , died ) who brought new triumphs to the Maratha \nempire. He wrote a most scholarly commentary on the Gita and \n\n \n\n\nHISTORY OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA \n\n\ndefended every orthodox tenet and practice of Hinduism, includ\u00ac \ning child marriage. He branded as a puppet any Indian who \nworked for the British. He exposed the emptiness of British \nconcessions to Indian home-rule aspirations. \n\nTilak\u2019s fierce imprecations, the British charged, stirred a young \nGhitpawan Brahman to assassinate a British official on June th, \n, the day of Queen Victoria\u2019s Diamond Jubilee, and Tilak \nwas condemned to two years in prison. Liberated before the end \nof his term, he resumed his Hindu-religious agitation which, \nwhile aimed at the British, did not, to say the least, improve \nrelations between Hindus and Moslems. \n\nHindu passions continued to simmer. Indian nationalism found \nfood in numerous events at home and abroad: the hollowness of \nBritish reforms nurtured it and so did the Japanese defeat of the \nRussians in the - war (the first time a coloured nation \ndefeated a white one), the  Russian revolution and the rise \nof the Young Turks. \n\nIn  Lord Curzon, considered by some the greatest Viceroy \nof India, decreed the partition of the province of Bengal. This \nact may have been the beginning of the end of British rule in \nIndia; Indians always mention it as a British atrocity. Curzon, \ndespite his monumental ability and industry, was a bureaucrat, \nautocrat and aristocrat. He lived close to his files and far from the \npeople. Bengal had a population of over seventy million and \nCurzon divided it the better to administer it. But the bisection \nwas on religious lines: the Moslem area was separated from the \nmore powerful Hindu area. Bitterness knew no restraint. Curzon \nwas accused of anti-Hindu prejudice and of trying to put the \nMoslems under a debt which they would have to pay in the coin \nof submissiveness. \n\nThese and similar charges were directed at Curzon until he \nleft India towards the end of . Bengal answered the partition \nwith assassinations. In the land of the Marathas, Tilak whipped \nhis followers into a frenzy. In both provinces British goods were \nboycotted; in both, Gandhi always found his most stubborn \nenemies. \n\nGandhi and Tilak were opposites. Gandhi was a quiet public \nspeaker, Tilak the consummate orator. Gandhi was wedded to \nnon-violence; Tilak justified violence. Gandhi fostered Hindu- \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nMoslem amity; Tilak favoured Hindu supremacy. Gandhi \nrespected means; Tilak pursued ends. Tilak\u2019s work bore bitter \nfruit. \n\nThe  annual session of Congress met in Calcutta, then the \ncapital of India as well as of Bengal. It demanded a reversal of \nthe partition, supported the anti-British boycott and resolved in \nfavour of self-government for India. \n\nLord Minto, Curzon\u2019s successor, let it become known in  \nthat he was contemplating reforms which would give Indians a \nbigger voice in the provincial legislatures and more jobs in govern\u00ac \nment offices. But the Tilak extremists were not mollified. Violence \ncontinued in Bengal and Maharashtra and spread to the Punjab. \nAt the  Congress session in Surat, moderates and extremists \nthrew sandals at one another. After the fray, the Tilakites with\u00ac \ndrew from the Congress, leaving the lawyers in control. \n\nThe reforms drafted by Lord Minto, with the assistance of \nJohn Morley, Secretary of State for India in London, were \nintroduced in  and . They extended Indian participa\u00ac \ntion in the all-Indian and provincial legislative councils and in \nprovincial executive councils as well. One Indian joined the \nViceroy\u2019s executive council. But Morley made it clear, in the \nHouse of Lords debate in December , that \u2018if it could be said \nthat this chapter of reforms led directly or indirectly or necessarily \nup to the establishment of a parliamentary system in India, I, for \none, would have nothing to do with it\u2019. More Indians sat on \nlegislative councils and they talked more, but they had no more \npower, for the councils themselves had no power; their function \nwas consultative. \n\nAny joy which Indians might have derived from the Minto- \nMorley reforms was soured by a concomitant measure: the intro\u00ac \nduction of separate electorates. In , a Moslem deputation \nled by the Aga Khan waited upon Lord Minto and urged that in \nall future elections Hindus vote for Hindu representatives and \nMoslems for Moslem representatives. Nationalist historians have \nbranded this interview as a \u2018command performance\u2019 rehearsed \nand conducted under Minto\u2019s baton. Whatever the facts, Minto \nand Morley granted the Moslem request, and in , separate \nreligious electorates, embellished with a device enabling Moslems \nto obtain more than their proportional number of seats (weight- \n\n \n\n\nHISTORY OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA \n\nage, this was called), became a permanent Indian institution \nwhose mischief was incalculable, for it made religious differences \nthe decisive factor in every political contest. The central political \nproblem in India was to bridge the gulf between Hindus and \nMoslems; this widened it. \n\nHowever, the first though not lasting effect of the separate \nelectorates was to bring more Moslems into the Congress party. \nProminent among them was Mohamed Ali Jinnah. \n\nIn , the new King, George V, and Queen Mary, visited \nIndia amid fantastic pomp. The King announced the removal of \nthe capital to Delhi and the annulment of the partition of Bengal. \nNevertheless, and though Tilak had been sentenced for sedition in \nNovember  to a long term of imprisonment and was ailing \nin Mandalay, acts of personal terror continued; in  Lord \nHardinge, the Viceroy, narrowly escaped death by a bomb. \n\nThe outbreak of war in  found some Indians loyal, some \ndisloyal and few enthusiastic, but many ready to serve in the \nBritish Army. More than half a million Indians fought for England \nin France, Flanders, Palestine and on other fronts. Indian princes \nand commoners distinguished themselves in combat on the ground \nand in the air. \n\nTilak had returned from exile in  and pledged loyalty. \nGandhi returned from South Africa, via London, in January \n and recruited for the British Army. But idleness and the \nIrish rebellion at Easter, , were too much for Tilak\u2019s fiery \nspirit and he burst forth into a passionate anti-British campaign \nin favour of home-rule. His companion agitator, who if anything \nexcelled him in oratory and vituperation, was Mrs. Annie Besant. \nThey were vigorously assisted by Sir G. P. Ramaswami Aiyar and \nby Mohamed Ali Jinnah. \n\nThe Indian earth rumbled with the noise of the volcano beneath \nit. Not only the politicians, but the soldiers and even the peasants, \nfelt that the blood Indians were shedding in Britain\u2019s battle should \nbe recompensed. On August th, , accordingly, Edwin S. \nMontagu, Secretary of State for India, announced in the House of \nCommons that British policy envisaged \u2018not only the increasing \nassociation of Indians in every branch of the administration, but \nalso the granting of self-governing institutions with a view to the \nprogressive realization of responsible government in India as an \nN M.G.  \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nintegral part of the British Empire\u2019. This was interpreted as \nbeing a pledge of Dominion Status. \n\nTilak thought that on occasions it might be desirable to occupy \npositions of power within the state apparatus. He once sent \nGandhi a cheque for fifty thousand rupees as a bet that-he could \nrecruit five thousand Marathas for the British army if Gandhi \nextracted a promise from the Viceroy that some of the enlisted \npersonnel would receive officers\u2019 commissions. Gandhi returned \nthe cheque. He did not like betting. And he felt that if you do \nsomething you do it because you believe in it and not for what you \nhope to get out of it. \n\nThe war closed victoriously in November . Trouble did \nnot wait long; it came early in . \n\nTilak had been interned again in August . Mrs. Besant \nwas also under arrest. Shaukat Ali and Mohamed Ali, brothers \nand powerful and prominent Moslem leaders, had been impri\u00ac \nsoned during the war. Secret tribunals had been sentencing people \nin all parts of India. Many newspapers were muzzled by war\u00ac \ntime censorship. These measures evoked great bitterness. But \nwith the coming of peace, the country expected the restoration \nof civil liberties. \n\nInstead* a committee headed by Sir Sidney Rowlatt, who had \ncome from England to study the administration of justice, issued \na report on July th, , which recommended, in effect, a \ncontinuation of the war-time rigours. The Congress party fiercely \ndenounced the Rowlatt findings. In February  a bill em\u00ac \nbodying them was nevertheless offered by the Government to the \nImperial Legislative Council. Gandhi attended the debate and \nappreciated the attacks levelled by Indian members against the \nbill but, since a majority of the Council consisted of British \ngovernment officials, its passage, after what Gandhi called the \n\u2018farce of legal formality\u2019, was assured. \n\nGandhi, just recuperating from dysentery and from an opera\u00ac \ntion for fissures necessitated by it, decided that the impending \ngovernment legislation was \u2018unjust, subversive of the principle of \nliberty and destructive of the elementary rights of individuals on \nwhich the safety of the community as a whole and of the State \nitself is based\u2019. \n\nAssuming that the bill would be enacted, Gandhi began pre- \n\n \n\n\nHISTORY OF BRITISH RULE IN INDIA \n\n\nparations for civil resistance on the pattern of his victorious effort \nin South Africa. Though still so weak that somebody had to read \nhis speeches, he travelled to many cities laying the groundwork \nfor a gigantic, nation-wide Satyagraha campaign designed to \ninduce the Government to withdraw the repressive legislation. \nMeanwhile, he appealed to the Viceroy by letter and through the \npress not to approve the law. \n\nOn March th, , the Rowlatt Act became the law of the \nland. An electric shock ran through India. Was this the com\u00ac \nmencement of Dominion Status? Was this the reward for the \nblood shed in the war? \n\nThe next day, Mahatma Gandhi, who had come to Madras for \na meeting, said to his host, C. Rajagopalachari, \u2018Last night the \nidea came to me in a dream that we should call on the country to \nobserve a general hartal.\u2019 A hartal is a suspension of economic \nactivity: shopkeepers do not open for business, employees do not \nreport for work, factories stay shut, ships are not loaded or un\u00ac \nloaded. Gandhi urged that hartal day be a day of \u2018fasting and \nprayer\u2019 and of \u2018humiliation and prayer\u2019. Thereafter Satyagraha \nwould unfold according to circumstances; resisters might, for \nexample, buy and sell proscribed books, or manufacture salt in \ncontravention of the law which made its production a state \nmonopoly. \n\nThe hartal was Gandhi\u2019s first act against the British government \nof India. Indeed, it was his first political act in India. His \nintervention on behalf of the Champaran sharecroppers had \nunintentionally involved him in friction with a British court. \nBut now he deliberately appealed for a nation-wide demonstra\u00ac \ntion against the British authorities. It was the beginning of his \ntwenty-eight years of struggle against British rule in India. The \nend of the struggle was the end of British rule. \n\n\ni \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER VIII \n\n\nMURDER \n\nG andhi\u2019s hartal idea spread throughout India. It united \nvast multitudes in common action; it gave the people a \nsense of power. They loved Gandhi for it. The hartal \nparalysed economic life; the dead cities and towns were tangible \nproof that Indians could be effective. What the Indian people \nneeded most and lacked most, was faith in themselves. Gandhi \ngave it to them. \n\nSix hundred men and women in Bombay signed the Satyagraha \npledge. Gandhi was happy. He had won with fewer numbers in \nSouth Africa. Vows were being taken in other cities, and in many \nvillages. \u2018Even such a mighty government as the Government of \nIndia,  Gandhi declared at Bombay, \u2018will have to yield if we are \ntrue to our pledge. For the pledge is no small thing. It means a \nchange of heart. It is an attempt to introduce the religious spirit \ninto politics. We may no longer believe in the doctrine of \u201ctit for \ntat  ; we may not meet hatred with hatred, violence with violence, \nevil with evil; but we have to make a continuous and persistent \neffort to return good for evil. . . Nothing is impossible.  \n\nSceptics mocked. \u2018I have no desire to argue,  Gandhi replied. \n\u2018As the British proverb says, \u201cThe proof of the pudding lies in the \neating    . The movement had been launched; it would surely \nspread and surely triumph. \n\nIn a further appeal to the Viceroy, the Mahatma put the whole \nquestion on a high, universal level. The Satyagraha campaign, he \ntold the Viceroy, \u2018constitutes an attempt to revolutionize politics \nand restore moral force to its original station  . He quoted a \nstatement of President Woodrow Wilson at Paris to the effect that \nif the moral force behind the League of Nations Covenant did not \nsuffice, physical force would. \u2018We  Gandhi wrote, \u2018hope to \nreverse the process and by our action show that physical force is \nnothing compared to moral force and that moral force never fails.  \n\nSomebody protested that Gandhi\u2019s Satyagraha campaign \nwould abet Bolshevism. (The Bolshevik Revolution had taken \n\n \n\n\nMURDER \n\n\nplace on November th, , and made a deep impression on the \nEast.) No, Gandhi said in a speech at Madras on March th, \n, s if anything can possibly prevent this calamity descending \nupon our country, it is Satyagraha. Bolshevism is the necessary \nresult of modern materialistic civilization. Its insensate worship \nof matter has given rise to a school which has been brought up to \nlook upon materialistic advancement as the goal and which has \nlost all touch with the final things in life ... I prophesy that if we \ndisobey the law of the final supremacy of spirit over matter, of \nliberty and love over brute force, in a few years\u2019 time we \nshall have Bolshevism rampant in this land which was once so \nholy\u2019. \n\nThe hartal, a prelude to Satyagraha, was observed in Delhi \non March th and in Bombay and other cities and villages on \nApril th; \u2018Needless to say,\u2019 Gandhi reported, \u2018the hartal in \nBombay was a complete success.\u2019 The nationwide hartal, he \nsaid, \u2018was a most wonderful spectacle\u2019. \n\nIn Delhi, however, the hartal provoked violence. The Punjab, \nhome of millions of Moslems and Hindus and of five million \nbearded, turbaned, stoutly built Sikhs whose religion was an off\u00ac \nshoot of Hinduism, echoed to riots and shootings. Leaders asked \nGandhi to come quickly to Delhi and the Punjab. The British \nstopped him at the borders of the province on April th and \nescorted him back to Bombay, where he was released. En route \nto and from Bombay, Gandhi sent messages that he was safe and \nfree; reports of his arrest had inflamed the already heated passions \nof the people; riots occurred in Bombay and Ahmedabad. \n\nOn April nth, Gandhi admonished his followers in Bombay. \n\u2018We have been throwing stones,\u2019 he said. \u2018We have obstructed \ntramcars by putting obstacles in the way. This is not Satyagraha. \nWe have demanded the release of about fifty men who had been \narrested for deeds of violence. But our duty is chiefly to get our\u00ac \nselves arrested. It is a breach of religious duty to endeavour to \nsecure the release of those who have committed deeds of violence \n... If we cannot conduct this movement without the slightest \nviolence from our side,\u2019 Gandhi warned, \u2018the movement might \nhave to be abandoned ... It may be necessary to go even further. \nThe time may come for me to offer Satyagraha against ourselves \n... I have just heard that some English gentlemen have been \n\ni \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\ninjured. Some may even have died from such injuries. If so, it \nwould be a great blot on Satyagraha. For me, Englishmen too \nare our brethren.\u2019 \n\nFrom Bombay, Gandhi went to his ashram at Sabarmati, \nwhere on April th he addressed a huge multitude. Ahmedabad \ncitizens too had committed acts of violence of which Gandhi was \nashamed; \u2018a rapier run through my body could hardly have pained \nme more\u2019. Scathingly he denounced them: \u2018We have burnt down \nbuildings, forcibly captured weapons, extorted money, stopped \ntrains, cut off telegraph wires, killed innocent people and plun\u00ac \ndered shops and private houses.\u2019 As penance, he announced that \nhe had undertaken a seventy-two-hour fast. He asked the people \nto fast twenty-four. \n\nImmediately after the Sabarmati meeting, Gandhi left for \nNadiad, a town in the Kheda district, twenty-nine miles from \nAhmedabad, where he had recruited for the war. There he \ndiscovered that violence had spread to small towns as well. \n\nDepressed, Gandhi told the people of Nadiad that the entire \nSatyagraha campaign was \u2018a Himalayan miscalculation\u2019 on his \npart. On April th he called off the movement. \n\nMany scoffed; the Mahatma, they taunted, had made \u2018a \nHimalayan miscalculation\u2019. But Gandhi never regretted a con\u00ac \nfession of error. \u2018I have always held\u2019, he wrote in his auto\u00ac \nbiography, \u2018that it is only when one sees one\u2019s own mistakes with a \nconvex lens and does just the reverse in the case of others, that \none is able to arrive at a just relative estimate of the two.\u2019 What \npolitician would say that? \n\nHis miscalculation, Gandhi explained, was in overlooking the \nfact that a person must be trained in civil obedience before civil \ndisobedience against some laws could succeed. \u2018I am sorry,\u2019 \nGandhi said in cancelling the Satyagraha campaign, \u2018that when I \nembarked upon a mass movement I underrated the forces of evil \nand I must now pause and consider how best to meet the situation.\u2019 \nNobody forsook his leadership because he did not immediately \nannounce a clever new plan to divert attention from the one \nthat failed. \n\nMeanwhile, the Punjab province boiled. Events there cul\u00ac \nminated in the occurrence in the sacred Sikh city of Amritsar on \nApril th, , which Sir Valentine Ghirol called \u2018that black \n\n \n\n\nMURDER \n\n\nday in the annals of British India\u2019. For Gandhi it was a turning \npoint. Indians never forgot it. \n\nAn official commission of inquiry, appointed by the government \nof India and consisting of seven members, four British and three \nIndian, with Lord Hunter, Senator of the College of Justice of \nScotland, as chairman, investigated the Punjab disturbances for \nmany months and then published its report. It found that in \nAmritsar \u2018the Hartal on the thirtieth [of March] was successful \nbeyond expectation and stopped the whole business of the city. \nThere was no collision with the police and no resort to violence\u2019. \nOn April th, Amritsar, a city of , inhabitants, observed \nanother hartal. \u2018This second time also the Hartal passed off \nsuccessfully,\u2019 the official Hunter Report affirms, \u2018and Europeans \ncould and did walk unmolested amongst the crowds.\u2019 \n\nOn April th, the Punjab government issued an order for the \ndeportation from the province of the two Congress party leaders, \nDr. Saifuddin Kitchlew, a Moslem, and Dr. Satyapal, a Hindu. \nIt was the day of the Hindu festival Ram Naumi in which, \naccording to the Report, Moslems also joined, shouting \u2018Mahatma \nGandhi ki jai (Long Live Mahatma Gandhi)\u2019 and \u2018Hindu- \nMussalman ki jai (Long Live Hindu-Moslem unity)\u2019, and \u2018drink\u00ac \ning out of the same cups publicly by way of demonstration\u2019. The \npolice expected that the demonstrators would try to liberate the \ntwo leaders and precautions were taken, but \u2018there was no \nattempt at rescue\u2019. \n\nThe banishing of the leaders removed from Amritsar the two \nmen who might have restrained the populace. \u2018Starting in anger \nat the action of the government in deporting the two local \npoliticians,\u2019 reads the Hunter Report, a mob raged through the \nstreets. At the National Bank, Mr. Stewart, the manager, and \nMr. Scott, the assistant manager, were beaten to death and at the \nAlliance Bank, Mr. G. M. Thomson, the manager, \u2018who attempted \nto defend himself with a revolver, was cruelly murdered\u2019. Other \nEnglish people were assaulted. \n\nTwo days later, Brigadier-General Reginald Edward Harry \nDyer arrived at Amritsar. Dyer, born in Simla, India, in , \nwas educated at Middleton College, County Cork, Ireland, and \nentered the British Army in . He fought on the north-west \nfrontier, in the Burma war and in the first World War. April \n\n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\n found him commanding a brigade at Jullunder, in the \nPunjab. Ordered to Amritsar on the  ith, he issued a proclama\u00ac \ntion on the th prohibiting processions and meetings. \u2018The issue \nof the proclamation which was formally signed by the Brigade- \nMajor on General Dyer\u2019s behalf/ says the Hunter Report, \u2018was \nleft to the police; it does not appear what steps were taken to \nensure its publication.\u2019 \n\nDuring the morning of the next day, April th, Dyer went \nthrough the city reading the proclamation to the people. \u2018From \nan examination of the map, showing the different places where \nthe proclamation was read,\u2019 the Hunter Report asserts, \u2018it is \nevident that in many parts of the city the proclamation was not \nread.\u2019 \n\nThe Hunter Report then tells the story of the massacre of \nApril th. \u2018About one o\u2019clock\u2019, it reads, \u2018General Dyer heard \nthat the people intended to hold a big meeting about four- \nthirty p.m. On being asked why he did not take measures to \nprevent its being held, he replied: \u201cI went there as soon as I \ncould. I had to think the matter out.\u201d \u2019 \n\nThe meeting took place at Jallianwalla Bagh. Bagh means \ngarden. \u2018Jallianwalla Bagh\u2019, the Report says, \u2018is not in any sense \na garden as its name would suggest. It is a rectangular piece of \nunused ground, covered to some extent by building material and \ndebris. It is almost entirely surrounded by walls of buildings. \nThe entrances and exits to it are few and imperfect. It seems to \nbe frequently used to accommodate large gatherings of people. \nAt the end at which General Dyer entered there is a raised ground \non each side of the entrance. A large crowd had gathered at the \nopposite end of the Bagh and were being addressed by a man on \na raised platform about  yards from where General Dyer \nstationed his troops.\u2019 The Report estimates that there were be\u00ac \ntween ten and twenty thousand persons in the Bagh. \n\nDyer went to the garden with twenty-five Gurkhas (soldiers \nfrom Nepal) and twenty-five Baluchis from Baluchistan armed \nwith rifles, forty Gurkhas armed only with knives and two \narmoured cars. \u2018On arriving at Jallianwalla Bagh\u2019, the Report \ndeclares, \u2018he [Dyer] entered with this force by a narrow entrance \nwhich was not sufficiently wide to allow the cars to pass. They \nwere accordingly left in the street outside. \n\n\n \n\n\n/ \n\n\nMURDER \n\n\n\u2018As soon as General Dyer entered the Bagh,  the Report con\u00ac \ntinues, \u2018he stationed twenty-five troops on one side of the higher \nground at the entrance and twenty-five troops on the other side. \nWithout giving the crowd any warning to disperse, which he \nconsidered unnecessary as they were in breach of his proclama\u00ac \ntion, he ordered his troops to fire and the firing continued for about \nten minutes. There is no evidence as to the nature of the address \nto which the audience was listening. None of them were provided \nwith firearms, although some of them may have been carrying \nsticks. \n\n\u2018As soon as the firing commenced the crowd began to disperse. \nIn all , rounds were fired by the troops. The firing was \nindividual and not volley firing ... As a result of this investigation \nit was discovered that approximately  people were killed.\u2019 \nThe Report estimates that there were three times as many \nwounded as dead. This adds up to  dead plus  wounded \nor  casualties with  bullets. The crowd, penned in the \nlow-lying garden, was a perfect target. \n\nUnder cross-examination before the Hunter Commission, Dyer \nrevealed his mind and purpose: \n\n\u2018Question: From time to time you changed your firing and \ndirected it to the place where the crowd were thickest? \n\n\u2018Answer: That is so.  \n\nThe crowd had rushed to the lowest wall, which was five feet \nhigh and that is where the bullets felled many of them. \n\n\u2018Question: Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the \narmoured cars to go in, would you have opened fire with the \nmachine-guns? \n\n\u2018Answer: I think, probably, yes.  \n\n\u2018When examined before us  , the Hunter Report asserts, \u2018he \n[Dyer] explained that his mind was made up as he came along in \nhis motor car; if his orders against holding a meeting were dis\u00ac \nobeyed he was going to fire at once.  \n\n\u2018I had made up my mind,  Dyer testified, \u2018I would do all men \nto death. . . .  \n\nGeneral Dyer\u2019s own dispatch to his military superior, which is \nquoted in the Hunter Report with his italics, said, \u2018I fired and \ncontinued to fire until the crowd dispersed and I consider this the \nleast amount of firing which could produce the necessary effect \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nit was my duty to produce if I was to justify my action. It was no \nlonger a question of merely dispersing the crowd , but one of producing a \nsufficient moral effect from a military point of view not only on \nthose who were present, but more especially throughout the \nPunjab. There could be no question of undue severity.\u2019 \n\nThe Hunter Commission decided that \u2018This was unfortunately \na mistaken conception of his duty.\u2019 It also found that \u2018in continu\u00ac \ning to fire for so long as he did it appears to us that General Dyer \ncommitted a grave error\u2019. \n\nMoreover, the Report notes that \u2018General Dyer\u2019s action in not \nmaking provision for the wounded at Jallianwalla Bagh has been \nmade the subject of criticism\u2019. Dyer said at the hearings, \u2018I was \nready to help them if they applied.\u2019 \n\nSir Michael O\u2019Dwyer, British Acting Governor of the Punjab, \napproved of Dyer\u2019s action and referred to the disturbances as \n\u2018rebellion\u2019. The Hunter Commission commented: \u2018The action \ntaken by General Dyer has also been described by others as having \nsaved the situation in the Punjab and having averted a rebellion \non a scale similar to the Mutiny. It does not, however, appear to \nus possible to draw this conclusion, particularly in view of the \nfact that a conspiracy to overthrow British power had not been \nformed prior to the outbreaks.\u2019 \n\nNot only was no insurrection intended or planned, but, accord\u00ac \ning to the Hunter Report, \u2018It appears that the outburst on the \nioth April subsided in a few hours, there was no repetition of any \nserious incident afterwards either on that date or on subsequent \ndates. And even with regard to the events on the ioth ... if the \nofficer in charge . . . had done his duty, the worst crimes, viz., \nthe murders of the bank officers . . . would in all probability have \nbeen prevented.\u2019 \n\nAmritsar had been calm for two and a half days when Dyer\u2019s \nbutchery occurred. His unnecessary massacre was the child of \nthe British military mentality then dominant in India. To \ncharacterize this mentality, the Hunter Report quotes an utter\u00ac \nance of General Drake-Brockman of Delhi who said, \u2018Force is the \nonly thing that an Asiatic has any respect for.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I thought I would be doing a jolly lot of good,\u2019 was Dyer\u2019s airy \nsummary of the massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh. \n\nTo add humiliation to hurt, General Dyer published his in- \n\n \n\n\nMURDER \n\n\nfamous C crawling order  . On April ioth Miss Sherwood, the \nheadmistress of a girls  school in Amritsar, had been barbarously \nattacked by the mob. Several days after the Jallianwalla Bagh \nblood bath, Dyer issued instructions that anybody passing the \nstreet where Miss Sherwood was assaulted would have to go on all \nfours. This applied even to members of families whose only \napproach to their homes was through that street. Gandhi felt \nworse about this \u2018outrage  , as he called it, than about the massacre. \n\nAt the spot, moreover, on which Miss Sherwood was beaten, \nDyer erected a whipping post for the public flogging of those who \nignored his order that Indians on animals and vehicles must \nalight, Indians carrying umbrellas or parasols must lower them, \nand all Indians must salute or \u2018salaam  with the hand as they \npassed British officers in some districts of Amritsar. \n\nThe British Secretary of State for India, Edwin S. Montagu, in \nan official dispatch to the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, dated \nMay th, , wrote, \u2018His Majesty\u2019s Government repudiate \nemphatically the doctrine upon which Brigadier-General Dyer \nbased his action  at Jallianwalla Bagh. The crawling order, \nMontagu added, \u2018offended against every canon of civilized govern\u00ac \nment  . Innumerable Englishmen were ashamed of Dyer\u2019s deed, \nyet he found many defenders. \n\nDyer was asked to resign from the army. Towards the end of his \nlife, he invented a range finder for sighting aircraft. He died in \nretirement at Bristol on July rd, . \n\nUnder the Hunter Commission\u2019s cross-examination, General \nDyer had said, \u2018Yes, I think it quite possible that I could have \ndispersed them perhaps without firing  but \u2018I was going to punish \nthem. My idea from the military point of view was to make a \nwide impression.  \n\n\u2018We have no doubt  , the official British Hunter Report con\u00ac \ntinued, \u2018that he succeeded in creating a very wide impression and \na great moral effect, but of a character quite opposite from the one \nhe intended.  Jallianwalla Bagh quickened India\u2019s political life \nand drew Gandhi into politics. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER IX \n\n\nGANDHI ENTERS POLITICS \n\nM ahatma Gandhi always resisted politics. He \nregarded his South African work as moral and social, \ntherefore religious. After his return to India in  he \nattended annual sessions of the Congress, but his public activity \nat such assemblies was usually limited to moving a resolution in \nsupport of the Indians in South Africa. Moreover, he regarded \nthe Congress as the unofficial parliament of India in which all \npolitical trends and parties were, or could be, represented. \n\nTo join one party dedicated to a political goal meant a separa\u00ac \ntion from other parties, and Gandhi disliked anything divisive. \nHe had strong beliefs but no dogmas. \n\nGandhi\u2019s \u2018readiness to take up the cudgels on behalf of any \nindividual or class whom he regarded as being oppressed\u2019, reads a \ndiscerning remark in a  British government publication, \u2018has \nendeared him to the masses of the country\u2019. He preferred the \nwarm bond of human affection to the cold tongue of a party \nprogramme. \n\nYet in  Gandhi joined the All-India Home Rule League \nand became its president. \n\nPolitics can probably be defined as competition for power. It \nimplies an effort to weaken, destroy, or assume the power of those \nin power. Gandhi did not wish to weaken, destroy, or supplant \nSmuts in South Africa. But by becoming leader of the All-India \nHome Rule League, Gandhi did accept the goal of Indian self- \ngovernment instead of government by England. The Congress \ndid not yet advocate independence. \n\nGandhi\u2019s early steps in politics were uncertain. Indeed, he \nremained politically unpredictable throughout life because his \nmind was a battlefield on which caution contended with passion. \nReady to die fighting for a principle, -he preferred to arbitrate and \ncompromise. He was a natural fighter and a born peacemaker. \n\nGandhi\u2019s criteria were not the usual criteria of politics. His \nleadership did not depend on victories. He did not have to save \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI ENTERS POLITICS \n\n\u2018face\u2019. In the autobiography, Gandhi tells of incidents that could \nnot have been known but for him, how he visited a brothel, ate \nmeat in stealth, maltreated his wife, etc. Truth had to be the whole \ntruth or it wasn\u2019t true. Indians, whom suffering has made sus\u00ac \npicious, could not suspect Gandhi because he told them every\u00ac \nthing; he hated secrets; he was his own harshest critic. He could \nadmit blunders, \u2018Himalayan  and less, because he did not claim \ninfallibility or superiority. \n\nGandhi\u2019s critics complained that he would withdraw from a \npolitical battle before all his forces had been brought to bear on \nthe enemy and, sometimes, when success appeared imminent. \nBut what success? His standards of success were moral and \nreligious. They gave his politics the only consistency and con\u00ac \ntinuity they had. \n\nThe road by which Gandhi arrived at the centre of the Indian \npolitical world was tortuous. It started at Jallianwalla Bagh; no \nmatter where he went the echo of General Dyer\u2019s fusillade pursued \nhim. Following the massacre, Gandhi asked permission to visit \nthe Punjab. He was rebuffed. He pressed his case. Finally, the \nViceroy telegraphed him that he could go after October th, \n. The Mahatma\u2019s reception at Lahore and other cities was \nunprecedented in size and warmth. \u2018The seething mass of \nhumanity\u2019, he wrote, \u2018was delirious with joy.\u2019 He had become a \nsymbol of national resistance to the foreign evil. \n\nIn the Punjab, Gandhi assisted Indian leaders, among them \nMotilal Nehru, a veteran Congressman and father of Jawaharlal, \nin the conduct of an independent inquiry into the Jallianwalla \nBagh massacre. He drafted the report; his colleagues felt he would \nbe without bias. \n\nWhile thus engaged, Gandhi received an invitation to attend \na Moslem conference in Delhi. He arrived there November th, \n. The Armistice which ended the first World War had been \nsigned on November  ith, . It sealed the defeat of Turkey, a \nMoslem country, and of the Turkish Sultan, who, in addition to \nbeing a temporal ruler, was the Caliph or religious head of all \nIslam. \n\nPan-Islamism has never been a mass movement in India or \nelsewhere. The fate of the Caliph nevertheless agitated the \nMoslems in India. The Moslem leaders, notably Mohamed and \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nShaukat Ali, the brothers who were interned by the British during \nthe war, Jinnah, Asaf Ali and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad had \nhoped that Indian interest in the Caliph would at least induce \nEngland to moderate the peace terms imposed on Turkey. But \nwhen it became obvious that the Turks would be shorn of their \nimperial possessions, and that the Sultan himself would be deposed, \nconcern for the Caliph, added to distaste for the British, produced \na powerful Caliphate or, as it is always known in India, Khilafat \nmovement. \n\nThe Moslem conference in Delhi, in November , which \nGandhi attended, was a Khilafat meeting. Many Hindus were \npresent. This period was the honeymoon of Hindu-Moslem politi\u00ac \ncal friendship. The letter of invitation, which reached Gandhi in \nLahore, said cow protection as well as the Caliph would be dis\u00ac \ncussed. Gandhi demurred. He told the conference that if, in \ndeference to Hindu regard for the cow as a sacred animal, \nMohammedans wanted to desist from slaughtering it, they should \ndo so irrespective of the Hindu attitude towards the Khilafat \nquestion. Similarly, if Hindus believed they ought to support \nMoslems on behalf of the Caliph they should, but not in the \nexpectation of a bargain on cow protection. The cow, therefore, \nwas removed from the agenda. \n\nThe conference debated what to do; resolutions condemning \nBritish harshness towards Turkey were not enough. A boycott \nof British textiles was suggested. But how could buyers distinguish \nBritish from other foreign textiles, and might not British goods be \nsold as Japanese or Italian or Belgian? Perhaps all imported \ncloth should be boycotted. Could India produce sufficient \ntextiles to supply the domestic market? \n\nGandhi sat on the platform searching his mind for a plan of \naction. He was looking for a programme and then for a word that \nwould be alike a slogan and a perfect summary of that programme. \nFinally, he found it, and when he was called on to speak he said, \n\u2018Non-co-operation.\u2019 Indians could not simultaneously oppose the \nGovernment and work with it. To boycott British exports was \ninadequate; they must boycott British schools, British courts, \nBritish jobs, British honours; they must non-co-operate. \n\n\u2018Non-co-operation\u2019 became the name of an epoch in the life of \nIndia and of Gandhi. Non-co-operation was negative enough to \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI ENTERS POLITICS \n\nbe peaceful but positive enough to be effective. It entailed denial, \nrenunciation and self-discipline. It was training for self-rule. \n\nGandhi\u2019s advice to the Moslem conference was contingent on \nthe final peace terms dictated to Turkey. If they were as onerous \nas expected and destroyed the status of the Caliph, then India \nwould non-co-operate. Thus Gandhi left a loophole for a modifica\u00ac \ntion of British policy vis-a-vis the Turks. \n\nThe annual session of Congress took place in the last week of \nthat year,  \u2014 at Amritsar. The fact that the Government \nallowed it to meet near Jallianwalla Bagh and that the Ali brothers \nwere released on the eve of the session so that they could come \nstraight to it from jail, fed Gandhi\u2019s congenital optimism. \n\nBy design or coincidence, the King-Emperor announced the \nmuch-heralded Montagu-Chelmsford reforms (\u2018A new era is \nopening,\u2019 the King declared) the day before Congress met. \nThe announcement, Gandhi asserted, \u2018was not wholly satisfactory \neven to me and was unsatisfactory to everyone else\u2019; nevertheless, \nhe favoured acceptance. In November, in Delhi, he urged non- \nco-operation. In December, in Amritsar, he favoured co\u00ac \noperation. \n\nThe Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, approved by the British \nHouse of Commons as \u2018The Government of India Act of \u2019 \nbecame the new Constitution of India on February th, . \nThe British called the new system \u2018Dyarchy\u2019; mon-archy, the \nrule of one \u2014 Great Britain \u2014 became dy-archy, the rule of two \u2014 \nGreat Britain and India. Indians, however, had no power in the \nfederal government and none was contemplated. In the provinces, \nIndian ministers would administer agriculture, industries, educa\u00ac \ntion, health, excise, roads, buildings, etc., but the British governor \nretained complete control of finance and police and he could over\u00ac \nride any decision of the Indian ministers and of the Indian legis\u00ac \nlature. Indian participation in the Civil Service was increased \nand promises of further increases were made. But Indians decided \nthat, on the whole, dyarchy was still the British monarchy. \n\nNevertheless, Gandhi took kindly to the King\u2019s proclamation of \nthe impending constitutional changes and wanted the  \nAmritsar Congress to accept them. He trusted Britain\u2019s good \nintentions. \u2018To trust is a virtue,\u2019 he said. \u2018It is weakness that \nbegets distrust.\u2019 But when he heard that C. R. Das, the famous \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nBengal nationalist, Jinnah and Tilak were opposed, he shrank \nfrom opposing such well-tried and universally revered leaders. \u2018I \ntried to run away from the Congress,  Gandhi reveals in his \nautobiography. \n\nGandhi was prevailed upon to stay, for he had become the rock \non which Congress rested. The session was attended by  \ndelegates, an unprecedented number, and many hailed from farms \nand city shops. Gandhi was their idol. They felt closer to him \nthan to the renowned lawyers. Only Tilak could still question \nGandhi\u2019s sway. \n\nTilak advocated acceptance of the Montagu-Chelmsford \nreforms with a view to proving their inadequacy. \n\nThis was not the Gandhian way. If you accepted something, \nyou had to do so without mental reservations and give it a fair \ntrial. If you did not want it, you had to fight it no matter who \nelse wanted it. \n\nThe delegates supported Gandhi. But he disliked defeating \nTilak. In a dramatic moment, Gandhi turned to Tilak who was \nsitting on the platform. Gandhi was wearing a small cap of white \nhomespun that resembled an aviator\u2019s cap; it later became known \nas the \u2018Gandhi Cap  of Indian nationalists. Gandhi dropped his \ncap on the ground as a gesture of obeisance and pleaded with \nTilak to approve a compromise. Tilak succumbed. \n\nThe compromise thanked Montagu for his part in the reforms \nand undertook to co-operate with the new dyarchy scheme in \nsuch a manner as to expand it into full parliamentary govern\u00ac \nment, but Lord Chelmsford, who had exonerated General Dyer, \nwas condemned for mismanaging Indian affairs and his recall was \ndemanded. Another resolution denounced British and Indian \nviolence in the Punjab. A third asked for the repeal of the \nRowlatt acts. \n\nHowever, the youth and the new elements activized by Gandhi \nhad expected much faster post-war progress towards self-govern\u00ac \nment; delicately balanced Congress resolutions disappointed them. \nHigh post-war prices were pressing additional millions down to \nstarvation level. The Moslems now knew that there would be no \namelioration of Turkey\u2019s fate; Montagu had sincerely tried, hence \nthe Amritsar Congress tribute to him, but the British Cabinet said \nno. In England, moreover, Dyer had found many friends; some \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI ENTERS POLITICS \n\n\ncollected a large purse for him. Gandhi did not want Dyer \npunished but he resented the fact that Dyer kept his pension. \nThe Hunter Report fully demonstrated Dyer\u2019s guilt yet recom\u00ac \nmended no measures against the Dyerism of British rulers in India, \n\nThree months after Gandhi had approved the Montagu- \nChelmsford dyarchy reforms at the Amritsar Congress session, \nthese developments turned him against them. \n\nThe Amritsar session was merely a temporary triumph of \nGandhian caution. The unmistakable trend of the country was \ntowards non-co-operation. Events moved fast. In April , \nGandhi was elected president of the Home Rule League. On \nJune th, guided by Gandhi, the Khilafat movement sanctioned \nthe policy of non-co-operation. Gandhi thereupon wrote to the \nViceroy, T have advised my Moslem friends to withdraw their \nsupport from Your Excellency\u2019s Government and advised the \nHindus to join them.\u2019 The Viceroy replied that non-co-operation \nwas \u2018the most foolish of all foolish schemes\u2019. All Chelmsford\u2019s \npower, however, did not suffice to check it. Gandhi announced \nthat non-co-operation would commence on August st, , to \nbe preceded by fasting and prayer on July st. That day Tilak \ndied. \n\nWith Tilak gone, Gandhi was the undisputed leader of Congress. \nA special session of Congress, which met at Calcutta between \nSeptember th and th, , approved the non-co-operation \nmovement. The annual convention at Nagpur, central India, in \nDecember, unanimously confirmed this approval; Gandhi then \noffered a resolution making the goal of Congress Swaraj, or self- \nrule, within the British Empire if possible or outside it if necessary. \nMr. Jinnah, and others, preferred home-rule within the Empire. \nThey lost. Jinnah lost interest in Congress. Gandhi politics were \nCongress politics. \n\nThe Nagpur session adopted a new Congress constitution \ndrafted by Gandhi. Congress had been a golden dome without \nunderpinnings. Gandhi converted it into a democratic mass \norganization with village units, city district units, provincial \nsections, an All-India Congress Committee (A.I.C.C.) of  \nmembers which made policy, and a Working, or Executive, \nCommittee of fifteen. \n\nTwenty thousand people attended the Nagpur session; it passed \n\n\no \n\n\nM.G. \n\n\n I \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nresolutions for the removal of untouchability, the revival of hand\u00ac \nspinning and hand-weaving, and the collection of a crore (or ten \nmillion) of rupees as a Tilak Memorial Fund. \n\nEuropean clothes were less in evidence at Calcutta and Nagpur \nthan at any previous Congress meeting. Less English was spoken, \nand more Hindustani. Middle-class delegates predominated. \nIndia\u2019s poor were there too. The men with great reputations and \ngreat fortunes no longer monopolized the limelight. Some drifted \naway from Congress, but Gandhi\u2019s magnetism held many of them; \nthey realized that he had a power over the people to which they \nnever even aspired. \n\nGandhi was middle caste and middle class. He entered politics \njust as large numbers of awakened middle-class Indians began to \nyearn for national freedom. He and they entered politics together. \n\nEverything in Gandhi\u2019s personality and record helped the \npeople to identify themselves with him and venerate him. Even \nsceptics were captivated by his courage, indestructible vitality, \ngood humour, near-toothless smile, selflessness, self-confidence \nand unlimited faith in people. \n\nIn a nation that was powerless, Gandhi became a symbol of \nstrength. In a nation of slaves, he behaved like a free man. Finally, \nhe was a man of God. \n\nHis idea of non-co-operation had an instantaneous, mighty \nappeal because it was so simple: You must not reinforce the walls \nof the prison that encloses you, you must not forge the fetters that \nwill bind you. He had promised at the Nagpur Congress session \nin December , that if India non-co-operated non-violently, \nself-government would come within twelve months. He carried \nthis message to the country. He made non-co-operation so per\u00ac \nsonal as to give each individual the impression that unless he non- \nco-operated he would delay Swaraj. Gandhi himself returned to \nthe Viceroy his two South African war medals and his Kaiser-i- \nHind gold medal for humanitarian work in South Africa. In the \naccompanying letter, Gandhi said, T can retain neither respect \nnor affection for a government which has been moving from \nwrong to wrong in order to defend its immorality.\u2019 Many Indians \nrenounced their British titles and their decorations. Motilal \nNehru abandoned his lucrative law practice, discontinued the use \nof alcohol and became a total non-co-operator. His son Jawahar- \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI ENTERS POLITICS \n\nlal, C. R. Das, the leader of the Calcutta bar, Vallabhbhai Patel, \nand thousands of others likewise left the British courts for ever. \n\nThousands of students dropped their professional studies. The \nTilak Memorial Fund benefited from the frenzy of self-sacrifice \nthat seized rich and poor; it was soon oversubscribed. Money was \navailable for the establishment of a chain of permanent Indian \ninstitutions of higher learning. \n\nStudents, teachers and professional men and women left the \ncities to go into the villages and teach literacy and non-co-opera\u00ac \ntion. For the peasant, non-co-operation meant non-payment of \ntaxes and no use of intoxicating liquors from which the govern\u00ac \nment derived a large revenue. \n\nGandhi toured the country incessantly, indefatigably, in torrid, \nhumid weather, addressing mammoth mass meetings of a hundred \nthousand and more persons who, in those pre-microphone days, \ncould only hope to be reached by his spirit. For seven months he \ntravelled in hot, uncomfortable trains which were besieged at all \nday and night stops by clamouring multitudes who demanded a \nview of the Mahatma. The inhabitants of one backwoods area \nsent word that if Gandhi\u2019s train did not halt at their tiny station \nthey would lie down on the tracks and be run over by it. The train \ndid stop there at midnight, and when Gandhi, aroused from deep \nsleep, appeared, the crowd, until then boisterous, sank to their \nknees on the railway platform and wept. \n\nDuring those seven strenuous months the Mahatma took three \nmeals a day; each consisted of sixteen ounces of goat\u2019s milk, three \nslices of toast or bread, two oranges, and a score of grapes or raisins. \n\nIn the provinces of Assam, Bengal and Madras, Gandhi and \nMohamed Ali, the younger of the Ali brothers, travelled together \nand addressed meetings together. They told every meeting that \nif they wanted India to rule herself they had to give up foreign \nclothing. The audience would burst into applause. At that \nmoment, Gandhi would ask the people to take off the foreign \nclothing they were wearing and put it on a heap which he would \npresently set on fire. In some places, men stripped themselves \nnaked. The apparel would be passed to a spot near the dais, and \nwhen all the hats, coats, shirts, trousers, underwear, socks and \nshoes had been heaped high, Gandhi set a match to them. \n\nAs the flames ate their way through the imported goods, Gandhi \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nwould tell his audiences that they must not substitute Indian mill \nproducts for foreign manufactures; they must learn to spin and \nweave. Gandhi took to spinning half an hour a day, usually before \nthe midday meal, and required all his associates to do likewise. \nBefore long, few Indians dared to come into his presence wearing \nanything but homespun. \n\nDaily spinning, Gandhi said, was a \u2018sacrament\u2019 and would turn \nthe spinner\u2019s mind \u2018Godward\u2019. Gandhi had a rosary but he never \nused it except perhaps at night when he watched the stars in \nmoments of sleeplessness. He found rhythm, instead, in the regular \nhum of the charka and in the steady chanting of \u2018Rama, Rama, \nRama, Rama, Rama (God)\u2019. \n\nGandhi\u2019s long propaganda circuit for non-co-operation had all \nthe attributes of religious revivalism. Yet wherever he went he \ntalked quietly to small groups about the launching of branch Con\u00ac \ngress organizations. He designed a Congress flag with a charka \nor spinning wheel in the centre. He recruited for the Volunteers \nwhose teen-age members, dressed in civilian uniform, kept order \nat meetings. And he regularly wrote several articles for each issue \nof Young India , an English-language weekly, and Navajivan , a \nGujarati weekly. Founded in , they were Gandhi\u2019s personal \norgans; neither took advertisements; both were published in \nAhmedabad. \n\nThe year was nearing its close. Gandhi had promised the nation \nSwaraj in . But self-rule was nowhere in sight. \n\nOne afternoon in September, Gandhi and Mohammed Ali were \nwalking to a meeting. Two British officers and some soldiers \nstepped up and arrested Mohamed Ali. Shortly thereafter, \nMohamed\u2019s older brother Shaukat was arrested. Both were sen\u00ac \ntenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment for trying to dissuade Moslems \nfrom serving in the British Army. Before his arrest, Mohamed Ali \nhad made plans to proceed to the Malabar coast in west India \nwhere the Moplahs, a Moslem community, had rebelled against \nthe Government; the affair had provoked Hindu-Moslem riots. \n\nMohamed Ali\u2019s arrest and the outburst of intercommunity \nviolence in Malabar upset Gandhi deeply. In his concept, the \nachievement of Swaraj depended primarily on Hindu-Moslem \nfriendship. \n\nHis Mohammedan partner gone, Gandhi strained all the more \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI ENTERS POLITICS \n\nfor results. Spinning became an obsession. He urged it with \nmounting persistence. In September , he emphasized his \ndevotion to homespun cotton and to simplicity by discarding, for \nall time, the cap he had worn, the sleeveless jacket or waistcoat, \nand the flowing dhoti or loose trousers, and adopted the loincloth \nas his sole garment. In addition, he carried a homespun bag for \nwriting equipment, the rosary and a few necessities, possibly some \nnuts or dried fruit. This was his \u2018mendicant\u2019s garb\u2019. \n\nThus attired, to the dismay and amusement of some of his \nassociates, he arrived in Bombay for decisive consultations with \nthe political leaders of the country. On October th, the Congress \nWorking Committee resolved that \u2018it is the duty of every Indian \nsolider and civilian to sever his connections with the Government \nand find some other means of livelihood\u2019. This was a summons to \ndesertion from the army. Congress thus reiterated the seditious \nstatement for which the Ali brothers had been incarcerated. \nCongress leaders were instructed to return to their districts and \npractise individual civil disobedience against the Government. \n\nInto this tense situation Britain thrust the Prince of Wales, \nsubsequently King Edward VIII and the Duke of Windsor. \nIndia was in no mood for glamour or demonstrations of loyalty. \nCongress boycotted his tour. He moved through deserted city \nstreets and amidst signs of hostility. In Bombay, those who came \nout to welcome the Prince were attacked, and bloody riots ensued. \nGandhi undertook a fast till the disturbances ended. He fasted \nfive days. \n\nThe Government now began to round up political leaders and \ntheir followers. C. R. Das, Motilal Nehru, Lajpat Rai and hundreds \nof other leading Congressmen were arrested. When the annual \nsession of Congress convened in Ahmedabad, in December , \ntwenty thousand Indians had been jailed for civil disobedience \nand sedition. The session elected Gandhi \u2018the sole executive \nauthority of the Congress\u2019. \n\nDuring December  and January , ten thousand more \nIndians were thrown into prison for political offences. In several \nprovinces the peasants spontaneously began no-tax movements. \nIndians in government offices left their jobs. \n\nThe Government responded with increased severity. Citing in\u00ac \nstances of official action, Gandhi called it \u2018worse than martial law\u2019 \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nand characterized the repression as \u2018savage, because it is wooden, \nwild, uncultivated, cruel\u2019. Flogging in prison and out was a daily \noccurrence. \n\nThe year  had passed, but no Swaraj. Gandhi was living \nat his ashram in Sabarmati, no doubt wondering what to do. \nHe rarely laid long-range plans; he submitted to sudden inspira\u00ac \ntions. There was dissension in Congress ranks; many ridiculed the \nMahatma\u2019s emphasis on temperance, homespun and verbal \ndefiance of the State. They demanded action. \n\nSome nationalists yearned for rebellion. But Gandhi believed \nin peace even at the price of defeat, though not at the price of \ncowardice. \u2018Where there is only a choice between cowardice and \nviolence,\u2019 he had written in Young India of August nth, , \u2018I \nwould advise violence.\u2019 But there was no cowardice. Non\u00ac \nviolence required more bravery than violence, and \u2018forgiveness is \nmore manly than punishment\u2019. Indians \u2018have better work to do, \na better mission to deliver to the world\u2019 than the punishment of \nthe Dyers. \u2018Non-violence,\u2019 he said, \u2018is the law of our species as \nviolence is the law of the brute. \n\n\u2018If India takes up the doctrine of the sword,\u2019 he declared, \u2018she \nmay gain momentary victory, but then India will cease to be the \npride of my heart . . . My religion has no geographical limits. If \nI have a living faith in it, it will transcend my love for India her\u00ac \nself.\u2019 He was not an uncritical my-country-right-or-wrong-my- \ncountry nationalist. \n\nLord Reading, the new Viceroy, had arrived in India on \nApril nd, . He had absolute power over the police and the \narmy. Congress had made Gandhi its dictator. One word from \nthe Mahatma would have started a conflagration compared with \nwhich the  Mutiny would have seemed like a minor affair. \n\nReading was a Jew who, after a remarkable career at the \nBar, became in turn Cabinet Minister, Lord Chief Justice of \nEngland, Ambassador to Washington, and now Viceroy. Shortly \nafter his installation at New Delhi, he indicated a desire to \ntalk with Gandhi. \u2018Rather exciting days lately,\u2019 Reading wrote \nto his son. \u2018... Intermediaries have stepped in and seen me with \na view to bringing about a meeting with Gandhi.\u2019 \n\n\u2018He certainly is a wonderful person,\u2019 Reading said of the rebel \nhe had never met. \n\n\n \n\n\nGANDHI ENTERS POLITICS \n\n\nGandhi accepted the Viceroy\u2019s invitation. Many Indians ob\u00ac \njected: Had he become a co-operator, they asked. \u2018We may attack \nmeasures and systems,\u2019 Gandhi replied. \u2018We may not, we must \nnot attack men. Imperfect ourselves, we must be tender towards \nothers and be slow to impute motives. I therefore gladly seized \nthe opportunity of waiting upon His Excellency. . . .\u2019 \n\nReading\u2019s eager anticipation to see Gandhi was amply rewarded. \nIn the latter part of May, he wrote to his son, he had six talks with \nthe Mahatma, \u2018the first of four hours and a half, the second of \nthree hours, the third of an hour and a half, the fourth of an hour \nand a half, the fifth of an hour and a half, and the sixth of three- \nquarters of an hour; I have had many opportunities of judging \nhim.  \n\nWhat did Reading think of Gandhi after thirteen hours of con\u00ac \nversation? \u2018There is nothing striking about his appearance,\u2019 he \ninformed his son. \u2018He came ... in a white dhoti [loincloth] and \ncap woven on a spinning wheel, with bare feet and legs, and my \nfirst impression on seeing him ushered into the room was that \nthere was nothing to arrest attention in his appearance, and that \nI should have passed him by in the street without a second look \nat him. When he talks, the impression is different. He is direct, \nand expresses himself well in excellent English with a fine appre\u00ac \nciation of the value of the words he uses. There is no hesitation \nabout him and there is a ring of sincerity in all that he utters, save \nwhen discussing some political questions. His religious views are, \nI believe, genuinely held, and he is convinced to a point almost \nbordering on fanaticism that non-violence and love will give India \nits independence and enable it to withstand the British govern\u00ac \nment. His religious and moral views are admirable and indeed \nare on a remarkably high altitude, though I must confess that I \nfind it difficult to understand his practice of them in politics . . . \nOur conversations were of the frankest; he was supremely cour\u00ac \nteous with manners of distinction . . . He held in every way to his \nword in the various discussions we had.\u2019 \n\nIt is not surprising that Reading failed to understand Gandhi\u2019s \npolitics. The Mahatma explained to the Viceroy how he expected \nto defeat Great Britain. \u2018Ours\u2019, he said he told Reading, \u2018is a \nreligious movement designed to purge Indian political life of cor\u00ac \nruption, deceit, terrorism and the incubus of white supremacy.\u2019 \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nThe major task was to purify India; England\u2019s expulsion would \ncome as a by-product. Therefore Indians would non-co-operate \nnon-violently. Reading disapproved. \n\nMany Indians disapproved. To Indians, however, the Mahatma \nwas indispensable, and because he was adamant \u2018to a point almost \nbordering on fanaticism\u2019, even the Indian champions of violence \nacquiesced in his non-violence. But why not, they demanded, \nlaunch non-violent civil disobedience campaigns simultaneously \nthroughout India? A resolution in support of this measure was \nactually adopted by the All-India Congress Committee meeting \nin Delhi on November th, , but Gandhi exacted a promise \nfrom all leaders not to move without his consent. \n\nGandhi preferred to try mass civil disobedience in one area, \nand he chose the county of Bardoli, population ,, near \nBombay, where he could personally supervise the experiment. \nOn February st, , Gandhi informed Reading of this plan. \n\nWhy did the Mahatma seek to paralyse the British administra\u00ac \ntion in only one limited territory of  tiny villages, thus making \nhimself an easy target for repression, when he might have done the \nsame thing in all provinces and added to the discomfiture of the \nGovernment or perhaps even brought it to terms? \n\nGandhi did not believe that civil disobedience, properly con\u00ac \nducted, could be defeated. What did it matter whether the \nGovernment was coping with a hundred thousand civil resisters or a \nhundred million? Could it kill the hundred thousand, or jail them? \n\nGandhi, moreover, was not contemplating a fight to the finish \nwith the British Empire. He knew that such a struggle would be \nviolent and prolonged, and on both sides it might lift into com\u00ac \nmanding posts men with the least scruples and the greatest \ncapacity for hatred, cruelty, dishonesty and dictatorship. No \nmatter who won the contest, both countries and the world would \nhave lost. \n\nAt the Ahmedabad Congress session in December , \nGandhi had appealed to the British government \u2018in all humility  : \n\u2018No matter what you do,\u2019 he said, \u2018no matter how you repress us, \nwe shall one day wring reluctant repentance from you; and we \nask you to think betimes, and take care what you are doing, and \nsee that you do not make the three hundred millions of India your \neternal enemies.  \n\n\n \n\n\nGANDHI ENTERS POLITICS \n\n\nIt was because of this spirit that Gandhi chose to work in the \nBardoli test tube. A united, unrestrained, self-disciplined Bardoli, \npeaceful but not co-operating with British administration, would \nimpress on the people of Great Britain the unpardonable horror \nof government by massacre, and might induce them to grant India \na fuller measure of independence than they now thought Indians \ndeserved or could wisely use. Gandhi always endeavoured to win, \nconvert and convince the adversary, not wrestle with him in a \npool of blood. Bardoli was ready for civil disobedience. \n\nBut on February th something happened in the United Pro\u00ac \nvinces, in Chauri Chaura, eight hundred miles from Bardoli. In \nthat small town, an Indian mob committed murder. There had \nbeen a legal procession, Gandhi reported in Young India of Febru\u00ac \nary th, . \u2018But when the procession had passed, the stragglers \nwere interfered with and abused by the constables. The former \ncried out for help. The mob returned. The constables opened fire. \nThe little ammunition they had was exhausted and they retired \nto the Thana [city hall] for safety. The mob, my informant tells \nme, therefore set fire to the Thana. The self-imprisoned con\u00ac \nstables had to come out for dear life and as they did so they were \nhacked to pieces and the mangled remains were thrown into the \nraging flames.\u2019 \n\nThe news of this atrocity reached Gandhi in Bardoli on Febru\u00ac \nary th, and it made him sick and sad. Violence upset him \nphysically and psychologically. \u2018No provocation,\u2019 he exclaimed, \n\u2018can possibly justify brutal murder of men who had been rendered \ndefenceless and who had virtually thrown themselves on the mercy \nof the mob.\u2019 \n\nIt was a \u2018bad augury\u2019. \n\n\u2018Suppose,\u2019 he asked, \u2018the non-violent disobedience of Bardoli \nwas permitted by God to succeed and the Government had abdi\u00ac \ncated in favour of the victors of Bardoli, who would control the \nunruly elements that must be expected to perpetuate inhumanity \nupon due provocation?\u2019 He was not sure that he could. \n\nHe accordingly suspended the campaign in Bardoli and can\u00ac \ncelled any defiance of the Government anywhere in India. \u2018Let \nthe opponent glory in our humiliation or so-called defeat,\u2019 he \nexclaimed. \u2018It is better to be charged with cowardice and weak\u00ac \nness than to be guilty of denial of our oath and to sin against God. \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nIt is a million times better to appear untrue before the world than \nto be untrue to ourselves.  \n\nSome members of the Congress Working Committee disagreed \nwith Gandhi\u2019s move. He saw the justice of their point of view. \u2018The \ndrastic reversal of practically the whole of the aggressive pro\u00ac \ngramme may be politically unsound and unwise,  he affirmed, \n\u2018but there is no doubt that it is religiously sound.  And when \nGandhi took a religious stand nobody could shake him. Chauri \nChaura, he said, \u2018shows the way India may easily go, if drastic \nprecautions be not taken  . Congress would have to educate itself \nand educate the people. As for himself, \u2018I must undergo personal \ncleansing. I must become a fitter instrument able to register the \nslightest variation in the moral atmosphere about me.  He fasted \nfor five days. \n\nMeanwhile a sharp struggle was taking place behind the British \nscenes. It is described by Lord Reading\u2019s son and biographer who \nhad at his disposal his father\u2019s private letters and unpublished \nstate papers. Official demands had been made for Gandhi\u2019s \narrest. \u2018The Viceroy  , the biography reads, \u2018was indeed far from \ndismissing as unfounded the opinion held by many competent \nobservers, notably Sir George [later Lord] Lloyd [Governor of \nBombay], that Mr. Gandhi\u2019s preaching of non-violence was no \nmore than a cloak for plans aimed at an ultimate revolution by \nviolence. Sir George would have had Mr. Gandhi arrested at \nonce, but Lord Reading, as always, opposed arrest for mere \nspeech-making, dangerous as the speeches might be, and awaited \nsome definite act. \u201cI am quite prepared to face the consequences \nof Gandhi\u2019s arrest if he takes action\u201d, Reading declared.\u2019 \n\nAfter an interval, the Secretary of State, Edwin \u2018Montagu\u2019, \nthe biography continues, \u2018instructed Lord Reading to arrest the \nprincipal leaders of the non-co-operation movement, including \nMr. Gandhi\u2019. Reading, however, resisted this order. His son, in \nthe biography of his father, writes: \u2018Lord Reading still preferred to \nwait for some definite move by Mr. Gandhi... It looked as though \nthe occasion for the arrest would come soon enough, for Mr. \nGandhi had announced that he was about to start active civil \ndisobedience in the Bardoli tehsil [county] of the Surat district in \nBombay Presidency, and on January th the Government of \nIndia telegraphed to Sir George Lloyd specifically enjoining him \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI ENTERS POLITICS \n\n\nto wait until Mr. Gandhi openly embarked on the Bardoli \ncampaign. . . .\u2019 \n\nThe biography then relates the events in Chauri Chaura and \nrecords Gandhi\u2019s cancellation of the Bardoli campaign on Febru\u00ac \nary th, before it had actually started. However, he continues, \n\u2018opinion in England was restive over Mr. Gandhi\u2019s continued \nfreedom, and Mr. Montagu telegraphed early in February saying \nthat he was \u201cpuzzled\u201d at the delay in making the arrest. A debate \nwas due to take place in Parliament on the th, and both Lord \nReading and Mr. Montagu were naturally anxious that, as the \narrest had to be made, it should be made in time for Parliament to \nbe informed of it as a fait accompli. But at this point the Indian \nmembers of the Viceroy\u2019s Council made the strongest possible \nrepresentations in favour of delay, and Lord Reading, after careful \nthought, decided that the risks of a little delay were on the whole \nless than those of immediate action which would easily be open to \nmisrepresentation both in India and abroad.\u2019 \n\nReading \u2018postponed the arrest\u2019, the biography says, \u2018but asked \nthe three Presidency Governors, Sir George Lloyd, Lord Willing- \ndon of Madras and Lord Ronaldshay of Bengal to come to Delhi \nand talk the matter over with him . . .\u2019 Ronaldshay could not \nleave Calcutta, but \u2018Lord Willingdon was only less disturbed than \nSir George by the apparent intention of the Government of India \nnot to proceed at all against Mr. Gandhi. . . .\u2019 \n\nOn March st, following these talks with the two most important \nBritish conservative administrators in India, Reading ordered the \narrest of Gandhi, and it took place on Friday, March th, , \nat . in the evening. A police officer stopped his car on the \nroad, eighty yards from Gandhi\u2019s hut in Sabarmati Ashram, and \nsent polite word by one of his men that the Mahatma should \nconsider himself under arrest and come as soon as he was ready. \nStanding surrounded by a dozen or more ashramites, Gandhi \noffered up a prayer and joined in the singing of a hymn. Then, \nin a gay mood, he walked to the car and was taken to Sabarmati \nprison. The next morning, Kasturbai sent clothes, goat\u2019s milk and \ngrapes to her husband. \n\nLord Reading had at one time asserted that he would arrest \nGandhi only after some overt act. Gandhi had taken none. The \nParliamentary debate had come and gone; it did not make the \n\n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\narrest necessary. Reading knew very well what Gandhi had been \nsaying in speeches and articles; they did not convince him of the \nwisdom of arresting the Mahatma. How then did Sir George \nLloyd and Lord Willingdon persuade Reading to act? \n\n\u2018I have had no trouble so far arising from Gandhi\u2019s arrest,\u2019 the \nViceroy wrote in April in a private letter to his son, the biographer. \nReading was obviously relieved that Gandhi\u2019s arrest had caused \nno public commotion. The provincial governors could have \npredicted this. \n\nHard-boiled considerations of \u2018law and order\u2019 prevailed over the \nViceroy\u2019s scruples. Gandhi had disarmed himself by suspending \nthe Bardoli civil disobedience; therefore he could be arrested with \nimpunity. Reading\u2019s April letter to his son confirms this. Gandhi, \nhe wrote, \u2018had pretty well run himself into the last ditch as a poli\u00ac \ntician by his extraordinary manifestations in the last month or six \nweeks before his arrest, when he ran the gamut of open defiance \nof Government with a challenge of all authority fixed for a certain \nday, and when the day arrived he went to the opposite extreme \nand counselled suspension of. the most acute activities. \n\n\u2018This of course caused dissension among his followers. . . .\u2019 \n\nSo Gandhi was \u2018in the last ditch as a politician . . .\u2019 Gandhi\u2019s \npoliticial career was finished. The measure of misunderstanding is \nfilled by a remark of the biographer-son: \u2018The mere fact that Mr. \nGandhi had been taken into custody and kept in jail like any other \nordinary mortal who had run counter to the Law was* in itself a \nreal setback to his prestige. . . .\u2019 \n\nGandhi had expected arrest and published an article in the \nMarch th issue of Young India entitled \u2018If I Am Arrested\u2019. \u2018Rivers \nof blood shed by the Government cannot frighten me,\u2019 he wrote, \n\u2018but I should be deeply pained even if the people did so much as \nabuse the Government for my sake or in my name. It would be \ndisgracing me if the people lost their equilibrium on my arrest.\u2019 \nThere were no disorders. \n\nAt the preliminary hearings the day after his arrest, Gandhi \ngave his age as fifty-three and his profession \u2018farmer and weaver\u2019 \nand pleaded guilty. The charge was writing three seditious \narticles in Young India. Mr. S. G. Banker, the printer of the maga\u00ac \nzine, was arraigned at the same time. Gandhi was kept in \nprison for trial. \n\n\n \n\n\nGANDHI ENTERS POLITICS \n\n\nThe first of the seditious articles appeared in Young India on \nSeptember th, , entitled \u2018Tampering with Loyalty\u2019. \u2018I \nhave no hesitation in saying\u2019, Gandhi wrote, \u2018that it is sinful for \nanyone, either soldier or civilian, to serve this government . . . \nsedition has become the creed of Congress . . . Non-co-operation, \nthough a religious and strictly moral movement, deliberately aims \nat the overthrow of the government, and is therefore legally \nseditious . . .We ask for no quarter; we expect none from the \ngovernment.\u2019 \n\nThese words made the Government case easy. If there was \ndoubt, Gandhi made it even more explicit in a second article, \u2018A \nPuzzle and Its Solution\u2019, in Young India of December th, . \n\u2018Lord Reading\u2019, he wrote, \u2018must understand that Non-co-opera- \ntors are at war with the government. They have declared \nrebellion against it . . . Lord Reading is entitled therefore to put \nthem out of harm\u2019s way.\u2019 \n\nThe third seditious article, \u2018Shaking the Manes\u2019, in Young India \nof February rd, , cried out in the opening sentence, \u2018How \ncan there be any compromise whilst the British lion continues to \nshake his gory claws in our faces?\u2019 Then sarcastically he informed \nthe British that \u2018the rice-eating, puny millions of India seem to \nhave resolved upon achieving their own destiny without any \nfurther tutelage and without arms\u2019. Adding that \u2018No empire \nintoxicated with the red wine of power and plunder of weaker \nraces has yet lived long in the world\u2019, Gandhi said. \u2018The fight \nthat was commenced in  is a fight to the finish, whether it \nlasts one month or one year or many months or many years. . . .\u2019 \n\nGandhi\u2019s only surprise was that he had not been arrested after \nthe first or second of these articles. \n\n\u2018The Great Trial\u2019, as it came to be known, was held in Govern\u00ac \nment Circuit House at Ahmedabad on March th, , before \nMr. Justice C. N. Broomfield, District and Sessions judge. Sir \nJ. T. Strangman, Advocate-General of Bombay, prosecuted. \nGandhi and Mr. Banker had no lawyers. Heavy military patrols \nguarded the building and nearby streets. The little courtroom \nwas crowded. Admission passes were marked: \u2018Sessions Case No. \n of . Imperator vs () Mr. M. K. Gandhi. () Mr. S. C. \nBanker.\u2019 \n\nAfter the indictment was read and the Advocate-General had \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nstated the case against Gandhi, the judge asked the Mahatma \nwhether he wished to make a statement. Gandhi had a written \nstatement ready. He introduced it with some oral, extemporan\u00ac \neous remarks. The Advocate-General, Gandhi said, \u2018was entirely \nfair ... It is very true and I have no desire whatsoever to conceal \nfrom this court the fact that to preach disaffection towards the \nexisting system of government has become almost a passion with \nme\u2019. Indeed, he had preached sedition long before the prosecution \nsaid he had. T do not ask for mercy. I do not plead any extenuat\u00ac \ning act. I am here, therefore, to invite and cheerfully submit to \nthe highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law \nis a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest \nduty of a citizen. The only course open to you, the Judge, is, as \nI am going to say in my statement, either to resign your post, or \ninflict on me the severest penalty if you believe that the system \nand the law you administer are good for the people. I do not \nexpect that kind of conversion, but by the time I have finished \nwith my statement you will perhaps have a glimpse of what is \nraging within my breast to run this maddest risk that a man can \nrun.\u2019 \n\nGandhi then read his prepared statement to \u2018explain why, from \na staunch loyalist and co-operator, I have become an uncom\u00ac \npromising disaffectionist and non-co-operator\u2019. In South Africa, \nhe began, his contacts with the British were not happy; \u2018I dis\u00ac \ncovered that I had no rights as a man because I was an Indian.\u2019 \nBut he thought this \u2018was an excrescence upon a system that was \nintrinsically and mainly good\u2019. So, he criticized the Government \nbut supported it, and joined in two wars which it fought. In \nIndia, too, he recruited for the British Army. \u2018In all these efforts \nat service,\u2019 he explained, \u2018I was actuated by the belief that it was \npossible by such services to gain a status of full equality in the \nEmpire for my countrymen.\u2019 \n\nIn , the shocks commenced: The Rowlatt acts, Jallianwalla \nBagh, the crawling order, the floggings, the injustice to the \nTurkish Caliph. Nevertheless, the Mahatma recalled, \u2018I fought \nfor co-operation and working the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms\u2019; \nhe still hoped. \u2018But all that hope was shattered.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I came reluctantly to the conclusion,\u2019 he told the court, \u2018that \nthe British connection had made India more helpless than she \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI ENTERS POLITICS \n\n\never was before, politically and economically . . . She has become \nso that she has little power of resisting famines. Before the British \nadvent, India spun and wove in her millions of cottages just the \nsupplement she needed for adding to her meagre agricultural \nresources. This cottage industry, so vital for India\u2019s existence, \nhas been ruined by incredibly heartless and inhuman processes \nas described by English witnesses. Little do town-dwellers know \nhow the semi-starved masses of India are slowly sinking to lifeless\u00ac \nness . . . No sophistry, no jugglery in figures can explain away the \nevidence that the skeletons in many villages present to the naked \neye. I have no doubt that both England and the town-dwellers \nof India will have to answer, if there is a God above, for this crime \nagainst humanity which is perhaps unequalled in history.\u2019 \n\nContinuing his indictment of the accuser, the prisoner said, T \nam satisfied that many Englishmen and Indian officials honestly \nbelieve that they are administering one of the best systems devised \nin the world and that India is making steady though slow progress. \nThey do not know that a subtle but effective system of terrorism \nand an organized display of force on the one hand, and the de\u00ac \nprivation of all powers of retaliation and self-defence on the other, \nhave emasculated the people and induced in them the habit of \nsimulation. This awful habit has added to the ignorance and self- \ndeception of the administrators. . . . \n\nT have no personal ill-will against any administrator,  Gandhi \nassured the judge, \u2018much less have I disaffection towards the \nKing\u2019s person. But I hold it an honour to be disaffected towards \na government which in its totality has done more harm to India \nthan any previous system. India is less manly under the British \nrule than she ever was before ... it has been a precious privilege \nfor me to be able to write what I have in the various articles \ntendered in evidence against me ... In my opinion, non-co- \noperation with evil is as much a duty as is co-operation with good.\u2019 \n\nIn conclusion, Gandhi again asked for the \u2018severest penalty\u2019. \n\nWhen Gandhi sat down, Mr. Justice Broomfield bowed to the \nprisoner, and pronounced sentence. \u2018The determination of a just \nsentence,\u2019 the judge declared, \u2018is perhaps as difficult a proposi\u00ac \ntion as a judge in this country could have to face. The law is no \nrespecter of persons. Nevertheless, it will be impossible to ignore \nthe fact that you are in a different category from any person I \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nhave ever tried or am likely to have to try. It would be impossible \nto ignore the fact that, in the eyes of millions of your countrymen, \nyou are a great patriot and a great leader. Even those who differ \nfrom you in politics look upon you as a man of high ideals and of \nnoble and even saintly life.  \n\nThe judge then announced that Gandhi must undergo im\u00ac \nprisonment for six years, and added that if the Government later \nsaw fit to reduce the term \u2018no one would be better pleased than I\\ \nMr. Banker received one year in jail and a fine of one thousand \nrupees. \n\nOn hearing the sentence, the Mahatma rose and said that the \nsentence \u2018is as mild as any judge could inflict on me, and so far \nas the entire proceedings are concerned, I must say that I could \nnot have expected greater courtesy\u2019. \n\nWhen the court was adjourned, most of the spectators in the \nroom fell at Gandhi\u2019s feet. Many wept. Gandhi wore a benign \nsmile as he was led away to jail. \n\nGandhi had no grievance. He knew when he entered Indian \npolitics that it involved going to prison. It meant this for him \nand for others. Whenever he heard of a friend or colleague who \nhad been arrested he telegraphed congratulations. Going to \nprison was a basic part of his doctrine of non-co-operation. \u2018We \nmust widen the prison gates,\u2019 he said, \u2018and we must enter them as \na bridegroom enters the bride\u2019s chamber. Freedom is to be wooed \nonly inside prison walls and sometimes on gallows, never in the \ncouncil chambers, courts, or the schoolroom.\u2019 Going to prison \nwas essential to arousing the nation for liberation. \n\nThe British obliged and sent him to prison often. But this was \nthe last time they tried him. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n",
    "1923-1927": " CHAPTER X \n\n\nGANDHI\u2019S FAMILIES \n\nW hen he passed through the prison gates, Gandhi left \nbehind him a country full of perplexed politicians and an \nashram full of two unhappy families: his personal family \nand his adopted family of secretaries, disciples, devotees and hangers- \non. All of them, including Kasturbai, now called him Father, \n\u2018Bapu\u2019, or \u2018Bapuji\u2019, the ji connoting a Hindu mixture of respect \nand tenderness. He received and gave a great deal of love. \n\nLove made him indulgent. For himself, he had an extremely \nstrict code of conduct. With others he was tolerant. \u2018Do not be \nfrightened by the wide implications of these views of mine,\u2019 he \nwrote to the women of the ashram. \u2018There are always two mean\u00ac \nings to everything \u2014 one wider and the other narrower. We shall \nnot be put out if you understand the wider implications but start \nwith the narrower.\u2019 \n\nFrom young manhood, he was sweet and kind towards every\u00ac \nbody except his wife and sons. A tension marred his early relations \nwith Kasturbai, but gradually it waned and he was able to relax \nwith her too. For instance, they frequently joked about their age; \nthey were born six months apart but they were not quite certain \nwho was younger and he would claim that he was and she that \nshe was. Gradually, as lust, in Gandhi\u2019s words, yielded to love, \nthey became a model couple, she the acme of service, he a paragon \nof consideration. \u2018Ba,\u2019 the Mahatma said, referring to Kasturbai, \n\u2018takes tea in spite of the fact that she lives with me. She also takes \ncoffee. I would even lovingly prepare it for her.\u2019 Tea- and coffee- \ndrinking were rather sinful in Gandhi\u2019s eyes. Ba, in other words, \nretained her personality; yet she attained a high degree of self- \neffacement. She never behaved like Mrs. Gandhi, never asked \nprivileges for herself, never shirked the hardest work, and never \nseemed to notice the small group of young or middle-aged female \ndisciples who interposed themselves between her and her illustrious \nhusband. Being herself and being at the same time a shadow of \nthe Mahatma made her a remarkable woman, and some who \np m.g.  \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nobserved them for long years wondered whether she had not come \nnearer the Gita ideal of non-attachment than he. He was too \npassionate to be the perfect yogi. \n\nAs he aged, the passions submitted to more rigid rein, but he \nnever quite learned to be a father to his sons. He had an un- \nGandhian coldness towards them. Perhaps he had an impersonal \nconcept of immortality. 'But may not an artist or a poet or a great \ngenius  , insisted an interviewer, 'leave a legacy of his genius to \nposterity through his own children?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Certainly not,  Gandhi replied in Young India of November th, \n. 'He will have more disciples than he can ever have children.  \n\nAs he was more severe with himself than with anybody else, so \nhe was severest with his own boys. He expected Harilal, Manilal, \nRamdas and Devadas to be chips off the old block, but the block \ndid not chip. He was especially critical of his children when he \nencountered a young man who did meet a difficult test. In a letter \ndated Johannesburg, May th, , Gandhi wrote to his oldest \nbrother Laxmidas. \u2018Young Kalyandas Jagmohandas\u2019s son is like \nPrahalad in spirit. He is therefore dearer to me than one who is a \nson because so born.  \n\nA popular myth, which, like so many other Hindu myths, was \ntightly woven into Gandhi\u2019s culture pattern, makes Prahalad the \nson of a demon King Hiranya-kashipu. The King hated God, but \nPrince Prahalad loved God. The King ordered tutors to teach \nPrahalad that his father was more powerful than God. When the \nteacher failed to convince the young man, the demon king sub\u00ac \njected Prahalad to a series of cruelties: the prince was thrown from \na high hill and trampled by elephants and horses. Still he pro\u00ac \nclaimed the supremacy of God. Finally, Prahalad was forced to \nembrace a red-hot metal pillar. But when he continued to call \nin His name, God emerged from the pillar in the form of a creature \nhalf lion, half man, and tore King Hiranya-kashipu to pieces. \n\nGandhi regarded Prahalad as the first Satyagrahi, and the \nIndian boy in South Africa who behaved like Prahalad was \ntherefore dearer to him than his own sons. \n\nIn the same  letter to his brother, Gandhi wrote, \u2018It is well \nif Harilal is married; it is well if he is not. For the present at any \nrate I have ceased to think of him as a son.  Harilal, Gandhi\u2019s \nfirst born, had remained in India in the hope of achieving personal \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI\u2019S FAMILIES \n\nindependence. At eighteen, he wanted to get married; his father \nthought it was too early and disowned him Tor the present\u2019. \n\nSix years later, still in South Africa, a young Indian married \nwoman successfully assaulted Manilal\u2019s continence. When the \ndereliction was discovered, Gandhi made a public scandal, fasted, \npersuaded the woman to shave her hair, and said he would never \nallow Manilal to marry. He only relented under Ba\u2019s pressure, \nin March , when Manilal was thirty-five. \n\nGandhi leaned over backward to give his sons less than he gave \nother men\u2019s sons. The treatment contained an antidote to the \nnepotism nourished by the strong Hindu family sense, but it was \nunfair, and Harilal and Manilal resented it. They felt disgruntled \nbecause their father, who had a profession, denied them a pro\u00ac \nfessional education. Gandhi contended that character building \noutranked law and medicine. That was all very well, they thought, \nbut then why did Bapu send Maganlal and Chhaganlal, his second \ncousins, and other young men to England to study? \n\nWhen Maganlal died, Gandhi wrote in Young India of April th, \n, \u2018He whom I had singled out as heir to my all is no more.\u2019 \nWhy this partiality to a second cousin? \u2018He closely studied and \nfollowed my spiritual career,\u2019 Gandhi declared in the same \nobituary, \u2018and when I presented to my co-workers brahmacharya \n[continence] as a rule of life even for married men in search of \nTruth, he was the first to perceive the beauty and necessity of the \npractice, and though it cost him to my knowledge a terrific \nstruggle, he carried it through to success, taking his wife along \nwith him by patient argument instead of imposing his views on \nher . . . He was my hands, my feet and my eyes. \n\n\u2018As I am penning these lines,\u2019 Gandhi wrote in a crescendo of \nlament, T hear the sobs of the widow bewailing the death of her \nhusband. Little does she realize that I am more widowed than \nshe. And but for the living God, I should become a raving maniac \nfor the loss of one who was dearer to me than my own sons, who \nnever once deceived or failed me. . . .\u2019 \n\nThe Mahatma thought Manilal had deceived him. In , \nManilal had in his keeping several hundred rupees belonging to \nthe ashram, and when he heard that his brother Harilal, who was \ntrying to make his way in business in Calcutta, needed money, \nhe forwarded the sum to him as a loan. By chance, Harilal\u2019s \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nreceipt fell into Gandhi\u2019s hands. The next day, Manilal was \nbanished from the ashram and told to go and apprentice himself \nas a hand-spinner and weaver but not to use the Gandhi name. \n\u2018In addition to this,\u2019 Manilal recounts, \u2018father also contemplated \na fast, but I sat all night entreating him not to do so and in the \nend my prayer was heeded. I left my dear mother and my \nbrother Devadas sobbing. Father did not send me away com\u00ac \npletely empty-handed. He gave me just sufficient money for my \ntrain fare and a little extra.\u2019 For two months, Manila! lived \nincognito. Then the Mahatma sent him a letter of introduction \nto G. A. Natesan, the Madras publisher, with whom Manilal \nstayed for seven months. In the letter of introduction, Gandhi \nrecommended that Manilal \u2018be subjected to discipline and should \nbe made to cook his own food and learn spinning\u2019. \n\nFollowing this period of penance, Gandhi dispatched Manilal \nto South Africa to edit Indian Opinion. \u2018During his lifetime,\u2019 \nManilal wrote after his father\u2019s assassination, \u2018I was able to spend \na very few years actually with my father. Unlike my other \nbrothers I had to live away from him in exile, in South Africa.\u2019 \n\nManilal came to India for occasional visits. \u2018The longest period \nI was able to spend in India, and most of it with father,\u2019 Manilal \nsays, \u2018was the whole of  and half of . Those were the \nprecious months . . .\u2019 At this time, Manilal noticed that Gandhi\u2019s \nattitude . . . had so vastly changed since the time we were under \nhim in our childhood. It seemed to me that he spoilt those near \nhim by his extreme love and affection. They had become his \nspoilt children, as it were, and much more so after my mother \nhad been called away from his life . . . One of the things that \nstruck me was the extreme softness in father\u2019s attitude compared \nwith what it was when we four brothers were under him. He was, \nof course, always forgiving though he was a very severe task \nmaster. But he had grown extremely tolerant, which he was not \nin our time . . . When I saw this, many a time I chafed and said \nto father, \u201cBapu, you have vastly changed from the time we were \nunder you. You never pampered us; I remember how you made \nus do laundry work and chop wood; how you made us to take \nthe pick and shovel in the bitterly cold mornings and dig in the \ngarden, to cook and to walk miles. And I am surprised to see \nhow you now pamper these people around you.\u201d \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI\u2019S FAMILIES \n\n\n\u2018Bapu would listen and burst out in his usual hearty laughter: \n\u2018\u2018Well, children,\u201d he would say, \u201care you listening to what Manilal \nis saying?\u201d And yet he would love and caress them.  \n\nHow much sorrow there is in all this for many lost years without \naffection. \n\nManilal underwent punishment and banishment yet remained \na balanced human being. Harilal, however, suffered an inner \ntrauma. While his wife lived, he was outwardly normal. But when \nshe died in the  influenza epidemic, and when Gandhi \nfrowned on his remarriage, Harilal disintegrated completely. He \ntook to alcohol and women; he was often seen drunk in public. \nUnder the influence of drink, penury and the desire for venge\u00ac \nance, he would succumb to the offers of unscrupulous publishers \nand attack his father in print, signing \u2018Abdulla  , a Moslem name. \nHe had become a Moslem. Conversion to Islam, drunkenness \nand profligacy were probably Harilal\u2019s effort to hurt his father. \n\nEarly in the s, Harilal helped to launch a new firm called \nAll-India Stores, Limited, and became a director. In , \nGandhi received a lawyer\u2019s letter on behalf of a client who had \ninvested money in the company; it informed the Mahatma that \ncorrespondence addressed to the company was being returned \nand that the whole thing seemed \u2018a bogus affair  . The client was \na Moslem \u2018whose respect for Mahatmaji led him to become a \nshare-holder  . \n\nGandhi reproduced the entire letter in Young India of June th, \n, and appended his reply. \n\nI do indeed happen to be the father of Harilal M. Gandhi. \nHe is my eldest boy, is over thirty-six years old and is father of \nfour children, the eldest being nineteen years old. His ideals and \nmine having been discovered over fifteen years ago to be different, \nhe has been living separately from me and has not been supported \nby or through me. It has been my invariable rule to regard my \nboys as my friends and equals as soon as they completed their \nsixteen years . . . Harilal . . . was naturally influenced by the \nWestern veneer that my life at one time did have. His commercial \nundertakings were totally independent of me. Could I have \ninfluenced him he would have been associated with me in my \nseveral public activities and earning at the same time a decent \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nlivelihood. But he chose, as he had every right to do, a different \nand independent path. He was and still is ambitious. He wants \nto become rich, and that too, easily. Possibly he has a grievance \nagainst me that when it was open to me to do so, I did not equip \nhim and my other children for careers that lead to wealth and \nfame that wealth brings ... I do not know Harilal\u2019s affairs. He \nmeets me occasionally, but I never pry into his affairs. I do not \nknow how his affairs stand at present, except that they are in a \nbad way . . . There is much in Harilafs life that I dislike. He \nknows that. But I love him in spite of his faults. The bosom of a \nfather will take him in as soon as he seeks entrance . . . Let the \nclient\u2019s example be a warning against people being guided by big \nnames in their transactions. Men may be good, not necessarily \ntheir children . . . Caveat emptor. \n\nHarilal naturally caused his mother endless tortures. Kasturbai \nbrought up his four children with a grandmother\u2019s tenderness. In \nthe s, she could not control her grief, and wrote Harilal an \nemotional letter; one of his adventures had got into the newspapers. \n\nMy dear son Harilal, I have read that recently in Madras \npolicemen found you misbehaving in a state of drunkenness at \nmidnight in an open street and took you into custody. Next day \nyou were produced before a bench of Magistrates and they fined \nyou one rupee. They must have been very good people to treat \nyou so leniently. \n\nEven the Magistrates showed regard for your father in thus \ngiving you only nominal punishment. But I have been feeling \nvery miserable ever since I heard about this incident. I do not \nknow whether you were alone that night or were accompanied by \nsome of your friends, but in any case you acted very improperly. \n\nI do not know what to say to you. I have been pleading with \nyou all these long years to hold yourself in check. But yo\\i have \nbeen going from bad to worse. Now you are making my very \nexistence impossible. Think of the misery you are causing your \naged parents in the evening of their lives. \n\nYour father says nothing to anyone but I know how the shocks \nyou are giving him are breaking his heart. You are committing \na great sin in thus repeatedly hurting our feelings. Though born \nas our son you are indeed behaving like an enemy. \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI\u2019S FAMILIES \n\n\nI am told that in your recent wanderings you have been criti\u00ac \ncizing and ridiculing your great father. This does not behoove \nsuch an intelligent boy as you. You little realize that you only \ndisgrace yourself by speaking evil of him. He has nothing but \nlove in his heart for you. You know that he attaches the greatest \nimportance to purity of conduct. But you have never paid any \nheed to advice. Yet he has offered to keep you with him, to feed \nand clothe you and even to nurse you. . . . \n\nI am a frail old woman unable to stand the anguish you are \ncausing. . . . \n\nYou have left no place for me anywhere. For sheer shame, I am \nunable to move about among my friends or strangers. Your \nfather always pardons you, but God will not tolerate your \nconduct. . . . \n\nEvery morning I rise with a shudder to think what fresh news of \ndisgrace the newspapers will bring. I sometimes wonder where \nyou are, where you sleep, what you eat. Perhaps you take for\u00ac \nbidden food ... I often feel like meeting you. But I do not know \nwhere to find you. You are my eldest son and nearly fifty years \nold. I am even afraid of approaching you, lest you humiliate me. \nI do not know why you have changed your ancestral religion; \nthat is your affair. But I hear that you go about asking innocent \nand ignorant people to follow your example . . . People are liable \nto be led away by the fact that you are your father\u2019s son. You are \nnot fit to preach religion. \n\nYour daughters and son-in-law also bear with increasing diffi\u00ac \nculty the burden of sorrow your conduct has imposed upon them. \n\n \n\nGandhi blamed Harilal\u2019s misdeeds on himself. T was a slave of \nmy passions when Harilal was conceived\u2019; T led a carnal and \nluxurious life during Harilal\u2019s childhood,\u2019 he would say. But the \ncause of Harilal\u2019s fall could not have been the natural impulses \nwhich led to his birth and to that of his brothers. Somewhere deep \nin Gandhi\u2019s psyche there was apparently a protest against having \nchildren. \n\nYet Gandhi loved children and was never as happy as when he \nplayed with them. He took time off to play with the youngsters \nand babies in the ashram. Once, during the week I spent with \nGandhi at Sevagram in , he led me to a hut used by a patient \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nof his and then to a neighbouring hut which was empty but for a \nred wooden cradle. The mother lifted the baby out of the cradle \nas Gandhi approached. He patted the baby\u2019s cheeks and said, \n\u2018She is not my patient, she is my relaxation.\u2019 The baby reacted \ngleefully and he smacked and pinched it playfully. \n\nThere is a delightful photograph showing Gandhi rubbing noses \nwith a babe in arms. He would amuse the children of the ashram \nby making funny faces at them and directing funny remarks to them. \n\nHorace Alexander, of the British Society of Friends, who spent \nyears in India and much time with Gandhi, records his first view \nof the Mahatma. He arrived at Sabarmati one afternoon in \nMarch . \u2018After a rest,\u2019 Alexander writes, \u2018I went to evening \nprayers. When all were assembled, he came walking quickly and \nsat down in the centre and the chanting began. When the prayers \nwere over, each member of the ashram gave his or her report on \nthe amount of spinning done. This lasted for fifteen or twenty \nminutes and was rather tedious. I noticed that the children ran \nplayfully around the Mahatma while this went on and he thrust \nout his hand as if to catch them as they ran past. Some years later, \none of these children, now a grown-up man, told me how difficult \nhe had found it, as he grew up, to realize that the kind old man, \nso simple and friendly, of his childhood days, was the same as the \nMahatma. . . .\u2019 \n\nGandhi believed in the goodness of children. \u2018Children are \ninnocent, loving and benevolent by nature,\u2019 he wrote in a letter \nto the boys and girls of the ashram. \u2018Evil comes in only when they \nbecome older.\u2019 \n\nLife at Sabarmati Ashram and, after , at Sevagram in \ncentral India, was serene, simple, joyous and unconstrained. \nNobody stood in awe of Gandhi. Until he was too old, he sat in \nthe scullery every morning with the ashramites peeling potatoes; \nhe did his share of other chores as well. Petty frictions and rival-' \nries were not absent even in this community of ascetics. There \nwas jealousy for the favour of the Mahatma. He usually succeeded \nin being above that battle too, but bulletins of its progress came \nto his attention. In fact, few details of the life and work of the \ninmates remained hidden from his shrewd ken. He soothed, \nsmoothed and arbitrated impartially. \n\nGandhi met and expected everybody in the ashram to meet \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI\u2019S FAMILIES \n\n\ncertain rigid requirements: absolute personal and civic cleanli\u00ac \nness, undeviating punctuality and physical labour plus one hour \nor at least thirty minutes a day of spinning. He denounced the \n\u2018divorce between intelligence and labour\u2019. Manual work was for \nhim a means of identification with working India, with the work\u00ac \ning world. His compulsion to economize, though instinctive, also \nstemmed from his conscious concern for the hundreds of millions \nwho valued a button, a nail and a fraction of a penny. \n\nGandhi once wrote out a telegram to G. V. Mavalankar, his \nlawyer, who later became Speaker of the Constituent Assembly. \nBut on learning that there was an extra charge per word because \nit was a holiday he posted the telegram. \n\nGandhi was famous for his postcards. Whenever the size and \nnature of the communication permitted he put it on a postcard \ninstead of into a letter. He frequently wrote letters on the reverse \nside of mimeographed announcements. Any odd piece of scrap \npaper became an ashram-made envelope. His secretaries\u2019 notes \nand his own memoranda were always written on the backs of \nletters received from outside. For a brief note he once wrote \nto New York he had obviously taken a larger bit of stationery than \nnecessary and carefully torn off the excess. \n\nMiss Slade, daughter of Sir Edmund Slade, a British admiral, \nwho joined Gandhi\u2019s ashram in  and lived there for many \nyears until she founded one of her own on the banks of the sacred \nGanges, tells how Gandhi lost the little pencil stump he had been \ncherishing. The staff hunted for the lost treasure but in vain. \nSomebody brought him a new pencil. No, he insisted that they \ncontinue the search for the stump until they recovered it. \u2018Bapu \n. . . received it with a beaming smile.\u2019 \n\nGandhi\u2019s insistence on economy, cleanliness, punctuality and \nspinning grew greater, if anything, as he grew older. With all his \nstrictness about the personal conduct of his co-workers, however, \nhe was completely tolerant towards their thinking. Some of his \nmost intimate political collaborators and some who stayed long \nin the ashram, did not, to his knowledge, believe in non-violence, \nor in Qod, or in loving the British or the Moslems. Mrdulla \nSarabhai, for instance, said to him, T am not a Gandhian,\u2019 but he \nlaughed and may have smacked her face affectionately. Nobody \nhad to toe a Gandhian \u2018party line\u2019. There was none. \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nGandhi accepted people as they were. Aware of his own defects, \nhow could he expect perfection in others? He believed in the \neducational and curative value of time and good deeds. \n\nGandhi took from a person, a book, a religion and a situation \nthat which was congenial to him and discarded the rest. He \nrefused to see the bad in people. He often changed human beings \nby regarding them not as what they were but as though they \nwere what they wished to be, and as though the good in them \nwas all of them. \n\nHis friends knew he forgave them, therefore they frankly con\u00ac \nfessed. If they hid things from him it was because he would blame \nhimself for their shortcomings. He encouraged familiarity; it \nnever bred contempt. It fostered love. He enjoyed banter even \nif the point pierced him. A few weeks before Gandhi was arrested \nin March , Rajagopalachari, already in jail, wrote the \nMahatma a letter. He said he was \u2018completely shut out from all \npolitics, news and newspapers. What an ideal condition which I \nknow you are envying ... It took me till now to get rid of the \nboils. I am now quite free from the trouble. It must horrify you \nto learn that I willingly underwent five injections of vaccine for \nthese boils. . . [Gandhi called vaccine \u2018filthy  .] Your eyes would \nflow with delight if you saw me here in my solitary cell spinning, \nspinning not as a task imposed by a tyrant faddist, but with \npleasure  . The \u2018tyrant faddist  printed the letter as the first item \nin Young India of February th, . \n\nSycophancy repelled Gandhi. He respected and befriended his \nfiercest antagonists. Though pleased to make a convert, he was \nhot flattered by loud partisans. He encouraged dissent; he helped \ndissenters. Opponents found comfort in the knowledge that he \ncould reverse himself on even the most important political issue \nin order to give the alternative policy a fair trial. \n\nSuch democratic liberalism made it possible for many members \nof his political family, some of whom had joined reluctantly in the \n- non-c-operation campaign, to lay plans for co-operation \nwhen Gandhi was sentenced on March th, , to six years  \nimprisonment. He had prohibited nothing when he entered \nprison. From his cell his only injunction was \u2018peace, non-violence, \nsuffering  . Congress, therefore, was free to flounder and meander \nin confusion. \n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER XII \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\nI n the latter part of , the world was subsiding into post\u00ac \nwar \u2018normalcy\u2019. The Dawes Plan undertook to stabilize \nGerman economic and political conditions. The big European \npowers were granting diplomatic recognition to Soviet Russia. \nExcept in south China, where Chiang Kai-shek had an alliance \nwith Moscow, the threat of Bolshevism was on the ebb. Goolidge \nand complacency presided over America. England had experi\u00ac \nenced her first Labour government. The British Empire, seriously \nmenaced in - by Sinn Fein in Ireland and Near East \nrevolts, was becalmed in stagnant waters. \n\nIndia, too, relaxed \u2014 and pursued the luxuries of division and \ninaction. The passions of the post-Armistice-post-Amritsar \nperiod were spent. Doubts and despondency had replaced faith \nand fighting spirit. Perhaps Gandhi\u2019s non-violence dampened \nthe ardour of belligerent nationalism. His twenty-one-day fast \nhad failed. It impressed many and altered the attitude of some, \nbut Hindu-Moslem tension continued unabated. \n\nGandhi did not consider this a time for a contest with Britain. \nIt was a time for mending home fences. His programme was: \nprepare morally for future political opportunities; concretely \u2014 \nHindu-Moslem unity, the removal of untouchability and spread\u00ac \ning the use of homespun or khadi or khaddar. In his propaganda \nfor homespun, Gandhi charged the British with killing India\u2019s \nvillage industries to help the textile mills of Lancashire. Otherwise, \nhis writings and speeches during ,  and  were \nremarkable for an almost complete absence of denunciations of \nBritish rule. He more often criticized Indians. \u2018I am not in\u00ac \nterested\u2019, he said, \u2018in freeing India merely from the English \nyoke. I am bent upon freeing India from any yoke whatsoever.\u2019 \nFor this reason, he could never get excited about participation in \nthe legislative or municipal councils: \u2018Swaraj\u2019, he affirmed, \u2018will \ncome not by the acquisition of authority by a few but by the \nacquisition by all of a capacity to resist authority when it is \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nabused.\u2019 A few hundred Indians were elected to councils, and a \nfew thousand Indians, mostly townspeople, enjoyed the franchise \nto elect them. In such circumstances, Indians might become \ntyrants unless the masses were taught to discard docility. \n\nThe intellectuals remained unconvinced. \u2018Though they like \nme personally\u2019, he wrote, they \u2018have a horror of my views and \nmethods.\u2019 He was not complaining; \u2018I have simply stated the \nfact with the object of showing my limitations.\u2019 \n\nEducated Indians, he stated, were splitting into parties. \u2018I \nconfess my inability to bring these parties together\u2019, he wrote on \nSeptember nd, . \u2018Their method is not my method. I am \ntrying to work from the bottom upward,\u2019 and he warned them \nthat if they did not support his khadi policy \u2018educated India will \ncut itself off from the only visible and tangible tie that binds them \nto the masses\u2019. \n\nGandhi put his trust neither in the once-hallowed tradition of \nCongress petitions and \u2018prayers\u2019 to British officialdom nor in the \ncurrent Swaraj party\u2019s desire to become parliamentarians and \nofficials. Bu having failed to carry the conviction home, \u2018I must \nno longer stand in the way of the Congress being developed and \nguided by educated Indians rather than by one like myself who \nhad thrown in his lot entirely with the masses and who has \nfundamental differences with the mind of educated India as a \nbody.\u2019 \n\nAn American clergyman once asked Gandhi what caused him \nmost concern. \u2018The hardness of heart of the educated,\u2019 Gandhi \nreplied. \n\nHe still wished to influence the intellectuals, he confessed, \u2018but \nnot by leading the Congress; on the contrary, by working my way \nto their hearts, silently so far as possible, even as I did between \n and \u2019. He regretted having been dragged into the \npolitical leadership of Congress; he was retiring from it. \n\nLoud protests rent the Indian air when he first announced his \nintention of doing so after coming out of jail in . \u2018I do not \nlike, I have never liked,\u2019 he said in reply, \u2018this reliance on me for \neverything. It is the very worst way of managing national \naffairs. The Congress must not become, as it has threatened to \nbecome, one man\u2019s show, no matter how good or great that one \nman be. I often think that it would have been better for the \n\n \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\ncountry and for me if I had served the full term of my imprison\u00ac \nment.\u2019 \n\nNevertheless, he was persuaded to take the presidency of \nCongress for ; his friends argued that his aloofness would \nsplit Congress between those who followed his constructive \nprogramme and the Swaraj party which advocated political \nwork in the councils. He exacted a price: the wearing of khadi as \na strict condition of membership in the Congress party; where \npossible, Congress members should spin each day. \n\nSomeone said his retirement from politics would cost him his \nmoral authority. \u2018Moral authority\u2019, was the unequivocal retort, \n\u2018is never retained by an attempt to hold on to it. It comes without \nseeking and is retained without effort.\u2019 \n\nIn truth, his moral authority was increasing irrespective of \nanything he did or did not do. It was fed by the Indian soil and \nIndian mentality. Throughout  he travelled, continuously, \nacross the -mile width and the -mile length of India, \nvisiting most provinces and many native states. He no longer \nlived nor travelled like a poor man, he wailed; his co-workers \nmade him travel in a second-class compartment instead of third \nwhere forty or fifty perspiring people sat squeezed together in an \nunpartitioned space. He acquiesced because in third class he \ncould not write his articles, or rest, or take an occasional nap. \n\nWherever he went, he was besieged by hordes. \u2018They will not \nleave me alone even when I am taking my bath,\u2019 he wrote. At \nnight, his feet and shins were covered with scratches from people \nwho had bowed low and touched him; his feet had to be rubbed \nwith vaseline. His deification had commenced. In one place he \nwas told that a whole tribe, the Gonds, were worshipping him. \n\u2018I have expressed my horror and strongest disapproval of this \ntype of idolatry more than once,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018I claim to be a mere \nmortal, heir to all the weaknesses that human flesh betrays. It \nwould be infinitely better that the Gonds should be taught to \nunderstand the meaning of my simple message than that they \nshould indulge in a meaningless deification of me which can do \nno good either to them or to me and can only intensify the \nsuperstitious nature of such simple people as the Gonds.\u2019 \n\nEven mere veneration seemed superfluous to him. \u2018I am no \nMahatma,\u2019 he cried out. \u2018My Mahatmaship is worthless,\u2019 he wrote. \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nBut the Mahatma was powerless; he had to be a Mahatma. \nMany regarded him as a reincarnation of God, like Buddha, like \nKrishna; God descended temporarily to earth. From the moun\u00ac \ntains, from the plains, from far-off villages, people came to have a \nglimpse of him, to be sanctified if the eye or, much better, the \nhand, touched him. Audiences were so large that he would \naddress them standing in front of them, then go to the right side, \nthe rear and the left side, always hoping that they would remain \nseated on the ground and not stampede towards him. Many times \nhe was in danger of being crushed to death. \n\nAt Dacca, in Bengal, a man of seventy was brought before \nGandhi. He was wearing Gandhi\u2019s photograph around his neck \nand weeping profusely. As he approached the Mahatma, he fell \non his face and thanked Gandhi for having cured him of chronic \nparalysis. \u2018When all other remedies failed,\u2019 the poor man said, \n\u2018I took to uttering Gandhiji\u2019s name and one day I found myself \nentirely cured.\u2019 \n\n\u2018It is not I but God who made you whole,\u2019 Gandhi rebuked \nhim. \u2018Will you not oblige me by taking that photograph off \nyour neck?\u2019 \n\nIntellectuals too were not immune. One day, Gandhi\u2019s train \nstopped with a jerk; somebody had pulled the emergency cord. It \ndeveloped that a lawyer had fallen out of the train, head first. \nWhen picked up he was unhurt. He ascribed it to being the \nMahatma\u2019s fellow traveller. \u2018Then you shouldn\u2019t have fallen out \nat all,\u2019 Gandhi laughed. But wit was lost on the devout. \n\nWomen, even Hindu women, sometimes sat on their haunches \nbehind a screen when they listened to Gandhi at meetings. Just \nas Moslems, Christians and even untouchables have borrowed the \ninstitution of caste from Hindus, so Hindus have in places suc\u00ac \ncumbed to Islam\u2019s purdah or segregation of women. But when a \nwoman came to Gandhi with her face hidden, he said, \u2018No purdah \nbefore your brother,\u2019 and she immediately dropped her veil. \n\nGandhi was an incurable and irresistible fund raiser. He found \nspecial relish in stripping women of their jewellery. \n\n\u2018The army of my sweethearts is daily increasing,\u2019 fie exclaimed \nduring a tour. \u2018The latest recruit is Ranibala of Burdwan, a \ndarling perhaps ten years old. I dare not ask her age. I was \nplaying with her as usual and casting furtive glances at her six \n\n \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\nheavy gold bangles. I gently explained to her that they were too \nheavy a burden for her delicate little wrists and down went her \nhand on the bangles.  \n\nRanibala\u2019s grandfather encouraged her to give Gandhi the \nbangles. \n\n\u2018I must confess I was embarrassed,  Gandhi recalled as he told \nthe story. \u2018I was merely joking as I always do when I see little \ngirls and jokingly create in them a distaste for much ornamenta\u00ac \ntion and a desire to part with their jewellery for the sake of the \npoor. I tried to return the bangles.  \n\nBut her grandfather said her mother would consider it an ill \nomen to take them back. Gandhi agreed to keep them on one \ncondition: she was not to ask for new ones. \n\nThat day he addressed a ladies  meeting in the same town. He \ntold them about Ranibala. T got quite a dozen bangles and two \nor three pairs of earrings, all unasked. Needless to say, they will \nbe used for khaddar. . . . \n\nT notify all the young girls and their parents and grandparents,  \nGandhi announced gayly, \u2018that I am open to have as many \nsweethearts as would come to me on Ranibala\u2019s terms. They will \nbe handsomer for the thought that they gave their prized orna\u00ac \nments to be used for the service of the poor. Let the little girls of \nIndia treasure the proverb, \u201cHandsome is as handsome does.   \n\nStill touring, he came to Bihar. At Kharagdeha, reached by a \nbranch railway and then a twenty-six-mile journey by car, the \nprogramme began with a ladies\u2019 meeting. \u2018Hitherto,  Gandhi \nreported, \u2018I have restrained myself from criticizing the heavily \nornamental decoration of some of my fair audiences, oppressive \nthough it has appeared to me. But the bangled arms from wrist \npractically to elbow, the huge thick nose-rings with about a three- \ninch diameter which could with difficulty be suspended from two \nholes, proved beyond endurance, and I gently remarked that this \nheavy ornamentation added nothing to the beauty of the person, \ncaused much discomfort, must often lead to disease and was, I \ncould plainly see, a repository of dirt.  \n\nGandhi feared he might have offended the ladies. But when he \nhad finished speaking they crowded around him and brought him \nmoney, and many handed him their ornaments. He hoped Indian \nwomen would dispense with \u2018these articles of personal furniture  , \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nWearing his homespun loincloth, a radiant smile and, usually* \nsandals (sometimes he went barefoot), he would stride with long, \neasy steps to the speaker\u2019s platform and make his appeal. While \nthe train waited during his meeting at a whistle stop in Bihar, \nGandhi made a one-minute speech: \u2018I have come here to do \nbusiness,\u2019 he said artlessly, \u2018to collect money for the spinning \nwheel and khadi and to sell khadi. Who knows, this may be my \nlast visit to Bihar. Let me do as much business as I can.\u2019 With \nthat, he moved among the listeners asking for \u2018ringing testimony\u2019 \nof their devotion to homespun. The people rang the tin bowl with \ntheir copper and nickel mites;  rupees were collected. (The \nrupee was one shilling and fourpence.) Then he took an armful \nof homespun cotton cloth, or loincloths, or women\u2019s saris and sold \nthem for as much as he could get. Mahadev Desai, his first \nsecretary, Devadas, his youngest son and other members of his \ngroup did likewise. \n\nIt was the custom to present him with a purse collected before \nhis arrival in larger towns. A purse might contain several hundred \nor even several thousand rupees. At the same time, ceremonial \naddresses of devotion were given to him. Many of these exquisitely \nexecuted documents were enclosed in silver caskets. \u2018Expensive \ncaskets are not required,\u2019 he admonished one committee, \u2018for I \nhave no use for them, nor. have I any room to keep them in.\u2019 He \ntried selling a casket to the people who gave it to him and not \nonly did they not mind, they paid lavishly for it. So he made a \nhabit of personally auctioning off such caskets; one brought \n rupees. He did the same with floral garlands thrown around \nhis neck. Why kill flowers unnecessarily, he argued, when they \ncould \u2018garland  him with a ring of yarn. Yam garlands became \nan Indian custom. \n\n\u2018Bania\u2019, Gandhi\u2019s friends called him with amazement. He was \nthe shrewd, successful businessman, but his income and profits \nwere never for himself \n\nAn American friend asked me to get him the Mahatma\u2019s \nphotograph with a personal inscription. I found a photograph \nin the ashram, explained the request and asked him to sign. \n\n\u2018If you give me twenty rupees for the Harijan Fund,\u2019 Gandhi \nsaid with a smile. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ll give you ten.\u2019 He autographed it. \n\n \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\nWhen I told Devadas, he said, \u2018Bapu would have done it for \nfive.\u2019 \n\nIn , ,  and , the popularizing of khadi \npossessed Gandhi\u2019s mind. Each issue of the weekly Young India \ndevoted several pages to lists of persons and the exact number of \nyards of yarn they had spun. Some spinners gave the yarn to the \nfund which gave it to villagers, others wove their own. Gandhi\u2019s \nSabarmati Ashram was manufacturing simple spinning wheels, \nbut in  the manager announced that they had more orders \nthan they could fill. Schools were giving courses in spinning. At \nCongress meetings, members would open a small box like a violin \ncase, take out a collapsible spinning wheel and spin noiselessly \nthroughout the proceedings. Gandhi had set the fashion. \n\nSome of Gandhi\u2019s closest friends accused him of khadi extrem\u00ac \nism; he exaggerated the possibility of restoring India\u2019s village \nindustries and overestimated the benefits that might accrue even \nif he were successful; this was the machine age; all his energy, \nwisdom and holiness would not avail to turn back the clock. \n\nC A hundred and fifty years ago,\u2019 Gandhi replied, \u2018we manu\u00ac \nfactured all our cloth. Our women spun fine yarns in their own \ncottages and supplemented the earnings of their husbands . . . \nIndia requires nearly thirteen yards of cloth per head per year. \nShe produces, I believe, less than half the amount. India grows \nall the cotton she needs. She exports several million bales of \ncotton to Japan and Lancashire and receives much of it back in \nmanufactured calico, although she is capable of producing all the \ncloth and all the yarn necessary for supplying her wants by hand\u00ac \nweaving and hand-spinning . . . The spinning wheel was pre\u00ac \nsented to the nation for giving occupation to the millions who had, \nat least for four months of the year, nothing to do . . . We send out \nof India sixty crores [six hundred million] (more or less) of rupees \nfor cloth. . . .\u2019 \n\nMany intellectuals sneered at khadi. The stuff was coarse, they \nsaid. \u2018Monotonous white shrouds,\u2019 some mocked. \u2018The livery of \nour freedom,\u2019 Jawaharlal Nehru replied. \u2018I regard the spinning \nwheel as a gateway to my spiritual salvation,\u2019 Gandhi said. \n\nGandhi was trying to bridge brain and brawn, to unite city and \ntown, to link rich and poor. What greater service could he per\u00ac \nform for a divided country and an atomized civilization? To help \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nthe underdog, Gandhi taught, you must understand him and to \nunderstand him you must at least sometimes work as he does. \nSpinning was an act of love, another channel of communication. \nIt was also a method of organization. \u2018Any single district that \ncan be fully organized for khaddar is, if it is also trained for \nsuffering, ready for civil disobedience.  Thus, khadi would lead \nto home-rule. \n\nGandhi asked townspeople and villagers to spend an hour a \nday at the wheel. \u2018It affords a pleasant variety and recreation \nafter hard toil.  Spinning does not replace other reforms; it is in \naddition to them. But he stressed them less than spinning. \n\n\u2018For me,  Gandhi reiterated, \u2018nothing in the political world is \nmore important than the spinning wheel.  One of India\u2019s greatest \nintellectuals, with a brain as keen as Gandhi\u2019s and as habitually \nsceptical as Gandhi was normally naive, enthusiastically sup\u00ac \nported the Mahatma\u2019s khadi contentions. Chakravarty Rajago- \npalachari, the famous Madras lawyer, was second only to Gandhi \nin his sanguine expectations from the nationwide use of home- \nspun. \u2018Khadi work is the only true political programme before \nthe country,  he declared on April th, , in the textile-mill \ncity of Ahmedabad. \u2018You are living in a great city. You do not \nreally know the amount of poverty that has overtaken the country \ncalled India. As a matter of fact, in India there are thousands and \ntens of thousands of villages where men do not get more than \n \\ rupees a month. There is no use shedding tears for them if we \nwon\u2019t wear a few yards of khadi which they have manufactured \nand want us to buy so that they may find a meal. If our hearts \nwere not made of stone we would all be wearing khadi. Khadi \nmeans employment for the poor and freedom for India. Britain \nholds India because it is a fine market for Lancashire. . . .\u2019 \n\nMotilal Nehru also took to wearing khadi; he peddled it in the \nstreets as Gandhi did. Intellectuals might scoff, but khadi began \nto have a fascination for them and from the mid-s, home- \nspun became the badge of the Indian nationalist. A propagandist \nfor independence would no more dream of going into a village in \nforeign clothes or foreign cloth or even in Indian mill cloth than \nhe would think of speaking English at a peasant meeting. Apart \nfrom its economic value, which has not proved decisive, homespun \nwas Gandhi\u2019s peculiar contribution to the education of political \n\n \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\nIndia: he made it physically conscious of poor, uneducated, non\u00ac \npolitical India. Khadi was an adventure in identification between \nleadership and nation. Gandhi was prescribing for a disease which \nplagued independent India and most independent countries. \nHe knew that the tragedy of India\u2019s history was the canyon be\u00ac \ntween the gold-silver-silk-brocade-jewel-elephant splendour of \nher palaces and the animal poverty of her hovels; at the bottom of \nthe canyon lay the debris of empires and the bones of millions of \ntheir victims. \n\nThe work exhausted Gandhi. Three or four stops a day for \nmeetings, a different place to stop every night, heavy correspond\u00ac \nence which he never neglected, and unnumbered personal inter\u00ac \nviews with men and women who sought his word on the biggest \npolitical problems and their smallest personal difficulties \u2014 all in \nthe great heat and humidity \u2014 wore him down. In November \n, therefore, he undertook a seven-day fast. \n\nIndia worried about him and protested. Why a fast? \u2018The \npublic will have to neglect my fasts and cease to worry about \nthem,\u2019 Gandhi stated. \u2018They are part of my being. I can as well \ndo without my eyes, for instance, as I can without fasts. What the \neyes are for the outer world, fasts are for the inner.\u2019 He would \nfast whenever the spirit moved him. The result, to be sure, might \nbe disastrous. \u2018I may be wholly wrong,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018Then the \nworld will be able to write an epitaph over my ashes: \u201cWell \ndeserved, thou fool.\u201d But for the time being, my error, if it be \none, must sustain me.\u2019 This was a personal fast; \u2018this fast has \nnothing to do with the public\u2019. It is said \u2018I am public property \n. . . So be it. But I must be taken with all my faults. I am a \nsearcher after truth. My experiments I hold to be infinitely more \nimportant than the best-equipped Himalayan expeditions.\u2019 He \nwas trying to scale the spiritual heights; he thought fasts conduced \nto mental ascendancy over the body. \n\nGandhi\u2019s fast brought him a tide of requests for his views on \nfasting; even in India his frequent abstentions from food were \nunusual. He gave his response in a Young India article. \u2018With \napologies to my medical friends\u2019, it read, \u2018but out of the fullness \nof my own experience and that of fellow-cranks, I say without \nhesitation, Fast () if you are constipated, () if you are anaemic, \n() if you are feverish, () if you have indigestion, () if you have \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\na headache, () if you are rheumatic, () if you are gouty, () if \nyou are fretting and foaming, () if you are depressed, () if \nyou are overjoyed, and you will avoid medical prescriptions and \npatent medicines.  His patent medical prescription for every\u00ac \nthing was fasting. c Eat only when you are hungry ,  he added, \u2018and \nwhen you have laboured for your food.  \n\nHis highest weight after being discharged from prison in \nFebruary , he wrote in the same article, was  pounds. \nHe was down to  pounds when he started the fast. In the \nseven days he lost nine pounds but regained it quickly. Physically, \nhe said, he lost nothing either from this fast or from the twenty- \none-day fast in . \n\nWater during fasts nauseated him without a pinch of salt or \nbicarbonate of soda or a few drops of citrus juice. He never \nsuffered any pangs of hunger during the fast; in fact, \u2018I broke it \nhalf an hour later than I need have.  He spun every day and \nattended the daily prayer meetings. The first three days of the \nfast, he wrote, \u2018I worked practically from four in the morning \ntill eight in the evening,  doing articles, answering letters, giving \ninterviews. On the fourth day, his head ached. He accordingly \nabandoned work for a day; on the seventh day \u2018I was able to \nwrite with a steady hand my article on the fast.  \n\nThe article furnished nine rules for fasting; he himself broke the \nfirst which was \u2018Conserve your energy both physical and mental \nfrom the very beginning, () You must cease to think of food while \nyou are fasting, () Drink as much cold water as you can . . . \n() Have a warm sponge daily, () Take an enema regularly dur\u00ac \ning fast. You will be surprised at the impurities you will expel \ndaily, () Sleep as much as possible in the open air, () Bathe in \nthe morning air. A sun and air bath is at least as great a purifier \nas a water bath, () Think of anything else but your fast, () No \nmatter from what motive you are fasting, during this precious \ntime think of your Maker and of your relation to Him and His \nother creations and you will make discoveries you may not have \ndreamed of.  \n\nIt was for these discoveries that he fasted. \n\nGandhi\u2019s year as president of Congress was now ended and at \nCawnpore, in December , he relinquished the gavel to Mrs. \nSarojini Naidu, mistress of lyric words. Gandhi then took a vow \n\n \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\nof a year\u2019s \u2018political silence\u2019. \u2018At least up to twentieth December \nnext,\u2019 he announced in Young India of January th, , \u2018I am \nnot to stir out of the ashram, certainly not out of Ahmedahad\u2019 \nacross the river. Body and soul needed rest. \n\nThe Swaraj party, which had sent its people into the legislative \ncouncils to obstruct the British government, veered slowly towards \na measure of co-operation. A dissident group, headed by M. R. \nJayakar and N. G. Kelkar, who believed in still more co-operation \nwith the British, but less with the Moslems, split off from the \nSwarajists and formed the Responsivist party. It leaned towards \nthe Hindu Mahasabha, a religious political party. In December \n, the Moslem League session at Aligarh, attended by Jinnah, \nMohamed Ali and Sir Ali Imam, moved in the direction of \nreligious politics. Gandhi had hoped to unite India for nationalist \nliberation. But she was splitting at her religious seam. Political \nIndia, Gandhi found, was \u2018disrupted and demoralized\u2019. It seemed \na good time for silence. \u2018Silence\u2019, he quoted, \u2018is the true language \nof cosmic adoration.\u2019 \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER XII \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\nI n the latter part of , the world was subsiding into post\u00ac \nwar \u2018normalcy\u2019. The Dawes Plan undertook to stabilize \nGerman economic and political conditions. The big European \npowers were granting diplomatic recognition to Soviet Russia. \nExcept in south China, where Chiang Kai-shek had an alliance \nwith Moscow, the threat of Bolshevism was on the ebb. Goolidge \nand complacency presided over America. England had experi\u00ac \nenced her first Labour government. The British Empire, seriously \nmenaced in - by Sinn Fein in Ireland and Near East \nrevolts, was becalmed in stagnant waters. \n\nIndia, too, relaxed \u2014 and pursued the luxuries of division and \ninaction. The passions of the post-Armistice-post-Amritsar \nperiod were spent. Doubts and despondency had replaced faith \nand fighting spirit. Perhaps Gandhi\u2019s non-violence dampened \nthe ardour of belligerent nationalism. His twenty-one-day fast \nhad failed. It impressed many and altered the attitude of some, \nbut Hindu-Moslem tension continued unabated. \n\nGandhi did not consider this a time for a contest with Britain. \nIt was a time for mending home fences. His programme was: \nprepare morally for future political opportunities; concretely \u2014 \nHindu-Moslem unity, the removal of untouchability and spread\u00ac \ning the use of homespun or khadi or khaddar. In his propaganda \nfor homespun, Gandhi charged the British with killing India\u2019s \nvillage industries to help the textile mills of Lancashire. Otherwise, \nhis writings and speeches during ,  and  were \nremarkable for an almost complete absence of denunciations of \nBritish rule. He more often criticized Indians. \u2018I am not in\u00ac \nterested\u2019, he said, \u2018in freeing India merely from the English \nyoke. I am bent upon freeing India from any yoke whatsoever.\u2019 \nFor this reason, he could never get excited about participation in \nthe legislative or municipal councils: \u2018Swaraj\u2019, he affirmed, \u2018will \ncome not by the acquisition of authority by a few but by the \nacquisition by all of a capacity to resist authority when it is \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nabused.\u2019 A few hundred Indians were elected to councils, and a \nfew thousand Indians, mostly townspeople, enjoyed the franchise \nto elect them. In such circumstances, Indians might become \ntyrants unless the masses were taught to discard docility. \n\nThe intellectuals remained unconvinced. \u2018Though they like \nme personally\u2019, he wrote, they \u2018have a horror of my views and \nmethods.\u2019 He was not complaining; \u2018I have simply stated the \nfact with the object of showing my limitations.\u2019 \n\nEducated Indians, he stated, were splitting into parties. \u2018I \nconfess my inability to bring these parties together\u2019, he wrote on \nSeptember nd, . \u2018Their method is not my method. I am \ntrying to work from the bottom upward,\u2019 and he warned them \nthat if they did not support his khadi policy \u2018educated India will \ncut itself off from the only visible and tangible tie that binds them \nto the masses\u2019. \n\nGandhi put his trust neither in the once-hallowed tradition of \nCongress petitions and \u2018prayers\u2019 to British officialdom nor in the \ncurrent Swaraj party\u2019s desire to become parliamentarians and \nofficials. Bu having failed to carry the conviction home, \u2018I must \nno longer stand in the way of the Congress being developed and \nguided by educated Indians rather than by one like myself who \nhad thrown in his lot entirely with the masses and who has \nfundamental differences with the mind of educated India as a \nbody.\u2019 \n\nAn American clergyman once asked Gandhi what caused him \nmost concern. \u2018The hardness of heart of the educated,\u2019 Gandhi \nreplied. \n\nHe still wished to influence the intellectuals, he confessed, \u2018but \nnot by leading the Congress; on the contrary, by working my way \nto their hearts, silently so far as possible, even as I did between \n and \u2019. He regretted having been dragged into the \npolitical leadership of Congress; he was retiring from it. \n\nLoud protests rent the Indian air when he first announced his \nintention of doing so after coming out of jail in . \u2018I do not \nlike, I have never liked,\u2019 he said in reply, \u2018this reliance on me for \neverything. It is the very worst way of managing national \naffairs. The Congress must not become, as it has threatened to \nbecome, one man\u2019s show, no matter how good or great that one \nman be. I often think that it would have been better for the \n\n \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\ncountry and for me if I had served the full term of my imprison\u00ac \nment.\u2019 \n\nNevertheless, he was persuaded to take the presidency of \nCongress for ; his friends argued that his aloofness would \nsplit Congress between those who followed his constructive \nprogramme and the Swaraj party which advocated political \nwork in the councils. He exacted a price: the wearing of khadi as \na strict condition of membership in the Congress party; where \npossible, Congress members should spin each day. \n\nSomeone said his retirement from politics would cost him his \nmoral authority. \u2018Moral authority\u2019, was the unequivocal retort, \n\u2018is never retained by an attempt to hold on to it. It comes without \nseeking and is retained without effort.\u2019 \n\nIn truth, his moral authority was increasing irrespective of \nanything he did or did not do. It was fed by the Indian soil and \nIndian mentality. Throughout  he travelled, continuously, \nacross the -mile width and the -mile length of India, \nvisiting most provinces and many native states. He no longer \nlived nor travelled like a poor man, he wailed; his co-workers \nmade him travel in a second-class compartment instead of third \nwhere forty or fifty perspiring people sat squeezed together in an \nunpartitioned space. He acquiesced because in third class he \ncould not write his articles, or rest, or take an occasional nap. \n\nWherever he went, he was besieged by hordes. \u2018They will not \nleave me alone even when I am taking my bath,\u2019 he wrote. At \nnight, his feet and shins were covered with scratches from people \nwho had bowed low and touched him; his feet had to be rubbed \nwith vaseline. His deification had commenced. In one place he \nwas told that a whole tribe, the Gonds, were worshipping him. \n\u2018I have expressed my horror and strongest disapproval of this \ntype of idolatry more than once,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018I claim to be a mere \nmortal, heir to all the weaknesses that human flesh betrays. It \nwould be infinitely better that the Gonds should be taught to \nunderstand the meaning of my simple message than that they \nshould indulge in a meaningless deification of me which can do \nno good either to them or to me and can only intensify the \nsuperstitious nature of such simple people as the Gonds.\u2019 \n\nEven mere veneration seemed superfluous to him. \u2018I am no \nMahatma,\u2019 he cried out. \u2018My Mahatmaship is worthless,\u2019 he wrote. \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nBut the Mahatma was powerless; he had to be a Mahatma. \nMany regarded him as a reincarnation of God, like Buddha, like \nKrishna; God descended temporarily to earth. From the moun\u00ac \ntains, from the plains, from far-off villages, people came to have a \nglimpse of him, to be sanctified if the eye or, much better, the \nhand, touched him. Audiences were so large that he would \naddress them standing in front of them, then go to the right side, \nthe rear and the left side, always hoping that they would remain \nseated on the ground and not stampede towards him. Many times \nhe was in danger of being crushed to death. \n\nAt Dacca, in Bengal, a man of seventy was brought before \nGandhi. He was wearing Gandhi\u2019s photograph around his neck \nand weeping profusely. As he approached the Mahatma, he fell \non his face and thanked Gandhi for having cured him of chronic \nparalysis. \u2018When all other remedies failed,\u2019 the poor man said, \n\u2018I took to uttering Gandhiji\u2019s name and one day I found myself \nentirely cured.\u2019 \n\n\u2018It is not I but God who made you whole,\u2019 Gandhi rebuked \nhim. \u2018Will you not oblige me by taking that photograph off \nyour neck?\u2019 \n\nIntellectuals too were not immune. One day, Gandhi\u2019s train \nstopped with a jerk; somebody had pulled the emergency cord. It \ndeveloped that a lawyer had fallen out of the train, head first. \nWhen picked up he was unhurt. He ascribed it to being the \nMahatma\u2019s fellow traveller. \u2018Then you shouldn\u2019t have fallen out \nat all,\u2019 Gandhi laughed. But wit was lost on the devout. \n\nWomen, even Hindu women, sometimes sat on their haunches \nbehind a screen when they listened to Gandhi at meetings. Just \nas Moslems, Christians and even untouchables have borrowed the \ninstitution of caste from Hindus, so Hindus have in places suc\u00ac \ncumbed to Islam\u2019s purdah or segregation of women. But when a \nwoman came to Gandhi with her face hidden, he said, \u2018No purdah \nbefore your brother,\u2019 and she immediately dropped her veil. \n\nGandhi was an incurable and irresistible fund raiser. He found \nspecial relish in stripping women of their jewellery. \n\n\u2018The army of my sweethearts is daily increasing,\u2019 fie exclaimed \nduring a tour. \u2018The latest recruit is Ranibala of Burdwan, a \ndarling perhaps ten years old. I dare not ask her age. I was \nplaying with her as usual and casting furtive glances at her six \n\n \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\nheavy gold bangles. I gently explained to her that they were too \nheavy a burden for her delicate little wrists and down went her \nhand on the bangles.  \n\nRanibala\u2019s grandfather encouraged her to give Gandhi the \nbangles. \n\n\u2018I must confess I was embarrassed,  Gandhi recalled as he told \nthe story. \u2018I was merely joking as I always do when I see little \ngirls and jokingly create in them a distaste for much ornamenta\u00ac \ntion and a desire to part with their jewellery for the sake of the \npoor. I tried to return the bangles.  \n\nBut her grandfather said her mother would consider it an ill \nomen to take them back. Gandhi agreed to keep them on one \ncondition: she was not to ask for new ones. \n\nThat day he addressed a ladies  meeting in the same town. He \ntold them about Ranibala. T got quite a dozen bangles and two \nor three pairs of earrings, all unasked. Needless to say, they will \nbe used for khaddar. . . . \n\nT notify all the young girls and their parents and grandparents,  \nGandhi announced gayly, \u2018that I am open to have as many \nsweethearts as would come to me on Ranibala\u2019s terms. They will \nbe handsomer for the thought that they gave their prized orna\u00ac \nments to be used for the service of the poor. Let the little girls of \nIndia treasure the proverb, \u201cHandsome is as handsome does.   \n\nStill touring, he came to Bihar. At Kharagdeha, reached by a \nbranch railway and then a twenty-six-mile journey by car, the \nprogramme began with a ladies\u2019 meeting. \u2018Hitherto,  Gandhi \nreported, \u2018I have restrained myself from criticizing the heavily \nornamental decoration of some of my fair audiences, oppressive \nthough it has appeared to me. But the bangled arms from wrist \npractically to elbow, the huge thick nose-rings with about a three- \ninch diameter which could with difficulty be suspended from two \nholes, proved beyond endurance, and I gently remarked that this \nheavy ornamentation added nothing to the beauty of the person, \ncaused much discomfort, must often lead to disease and was, I \ncould plainly see, a repository of dirt.  \n\nGandhi feared he might have offended the ladies. But when he \nhad finished speaking they crowded around him and brought him \nmoney, and many handed him their ornaments. He hoped Indian \nwomen would dispense with \u2018these articles of personal furniture  , \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nWearing his homespun loincloth, a radiant smile and, usually* \nsandals (sometimes he went barefoot), he would stride with long, \neasy steps to the speaker\u2019s platform and make his appeal. While \nthe train waited during his meeting at a whistle stop in Bihar, \nGandhi made a one-minute speech: \u2018I have come here to do \nbusiness,\u2019 he said artlessly, \u2018to collect money for the spinning \nwheel and khadi and to sell khadi. Who knows, this may be my \nlast visit to Bihar. Let me do as much business as I can.\u2019 With \nthat, he moved among the listeners asking for \u2018ringing testimony\u2019 \nof their devotion to homespun. The people rang the tin bowl with \ntheir copper and nickel mites;  rupees were collected. (The \nrupee was one shilling and fourpence.) Then he took an armful \nof homespun cotton cloth, or loincloths, or women\u2019s saris and sold \nthem for as much as he could get. Mahadev Desai, his first \nsecretary, Devadas, his youngest son and other members of his \ngroup did likewise. \n\nIt was the custom to present him with a purse collected before \nhis arrival in larger towns. A purse might contain several hundred \nor even several thousand rupees. At the same time, ceremonial \naddresses of devotion were given to him. Many of these exquisitely \nexecuted documents were enclosed in silver caskets. \u2018Expensive \ncaskets are not required,\u2019 he admonished one committee, \u2018for I \nhave no use for them, nor. have I any room to keep them in.\u2019 He \ntried selling a casket to the people who gave it to him and not \nonly did they not mind, they paid lavishly for it. So he made a \nhabit of personally auctioning off such caskets; one brought \n rupees. He did the same with floral garlands thrown around \nhis neck. Why kill flowers unnecessarily, he argued, when they \ncould \u2018garland  him with a ring of yarn. Yam garlands became \nan Indian custom. \n\n\u2018Bania\u2019, Gandhi\u2019s friends called him with amazement. He was \nthe shrewd, successful businessman, but his income and profits \nwere never for himself \n\nAn American friend asked me to get him the Mahatma\u2019s \nphotograph with a personal inscription. I found a photograph \nin the ashram, explained the request and asked him to sign. \n\n\u2018If you give me twenty rupees for the Harijan Fund,\u2019 Gandhi \nsaid with a smile. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ll give you ten.\u2019 He autographed it. \n\n \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\nWhen I told Devadas, he said, \u2018Bapu would have done it for \nfive.\u2019 \n\nIn , ,  and , the popularizing of khadi \npossessed Gandhi\u2019s mind. Each issue of the weekly Young India \ndevoted several pages to lists of persons and the exact number of \nyards of yarn they had spun. Some spinners gave the yarn to the \nfund which gave it to villagers, others wove their own. Gandhi\u2019s \nSabarmati Ashram was manufacturing simple spinning wheels, \nbut in  the manager announced that they had more orders \nthan they could fill. Schools were giving courses in spinning. At \nCongress meetings, members would open a small box like a violin \ncase, take out a collapsible spinning wheel and spin noiselessly \nthroughout the proceedings. Gandhi had set the fashion. \n\nSome of Gandhi\u2019s closest friends accused him of khadi extrem\u00ac \nism; he exaggerated the possibility of restoring India\u2019s village \nindustries and overestimated the benefits that might accrue even \nif he were successful; this was the machine age; all his energy, \nwisdom and holiness would not avail to turn back the clock. \n\nC A hundred and fifty years ago,\u2019 Gandhi replied, \u2018we manu\u00ac \nfactured all our cloth. Our women spun fine yarns in their own \ncottages and supplemented the earnings of their husbands . . . \nIndia requires nearly thirteen yards of cloth per head per year. \nShe produces, I believe, less than half the amount. India grows \nall the cotton she needs. She exports several million bales of \ncotton to Japan and Lancashire and receives much of it back in \nmanufactured calico, although she is capable of producing all the \ncloth and all the yarn necessary for supplying her wants by hand\u00ac \nweaving and hand-spinning . . . The spinning wheel was pre\u00ac \nsented to the nation for giving occupation to the millions who had, \nat least for four months of the year, nothing to do . . . We send out \nof India sixty crores [six hundred million] (more or less) of rupees \nfor cloth. . . .\u2019 \n\nMany intellectuals sneered at khadi. The stuff was coarse, they \nsaid. \u2018Monotonous white shrouds,\u2019 some mocked. \u2018The livery of \nour freedom,\u2019 Jawaharlal Nehru replied. \u2018I regard the spinning \nwheel as a gateway to my spiritual salvation,\u2019 Gandhi said. \n\nGandhi was trying to bridge brain and brawn, to unite city and \ntown, to link rich and poor. What greater service could he per\u00ac \nform for a divided country and an atomized civilization? To help \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nthe underdog, Gandhi taught, you must understand him and to \nunderstand him you must at least sometimes work as he does. \nSpinning was an act of love, another channel of communication. \nIt was also a method of organization. \u2018Any single district that \ncan be fully organized for khaddar is, if it is also trained for \nsuffering, ready for civil disobedience.  Thus, khadi would lead \nto home-rule. \n\nGandhi asked townspeople and villagers to spend an hour a \nday at the wheel. \u2018It affords a pleasant variety and recreation \nafter hard toil.  Spinning does not replace other reforms; it is in \naddition to them. But he stressed them less than spinning. \n\n\u2018For me,  Gandhi reiterated, \u2018nothing in the political world is \nmore important than the spinning wheel.  One of India\u2019s greatest \nintellectuals, with a brain as keen as Gandhi\u2019s and as habitually \nsceptical as Gandhi was normally naive, enthusiastically sup\u00ac \nported the Mahatma\u2019s khadi contentions. Chakravarty Rajago- \npalachari, the famous Madras lawyer, was second only to Gandhi \nin his sanguine expectations from the nationwide use of home- \nspun. \u2018Khadi work is the only true political programme before \nthe country,  he declared on April th, , in the textile-mill \ncity of Ahmedabad. \u2018You are living in a great city. You do not \nreally know the amount of poverty that has overtaken the country \ncalled India. As a matter of fact, in India there are thousands and \ntens of thousands of villages where men do not get more than \n \\ rupees a month. There is no use shedding tears for them if we \nwon\u2019t wear a few yards of khadi which they have manufactured \nand want us to buy so that they may find a meal. If our hearts \nwere not made of stone we would all be wearing khadi. Khadi \nmeans employment for the poor and freedom for India. Britain \nholds India because it is a fine market for Lancashire. . . .\u2019 \n\nMotilal Nehru also took to wearing khadi; he peddled it in the \nstreets as Gandhi did. Intellectuals might scoff, but khadi began \nto have a fascination for them and from the mid-s, home- \nspun became the badge of the Indian nationalist. A propagandist \nfor independence would no more dream of going into a village in \nforeign clothes or foreign cloth or even in Indian mill cloth than \nhe would think of speaking English at a peasant meeting. Apart \nfrom its economic value, which has not proved decisive, homespun \nwas Gandhi\u2019s peculiar contribution to the education of political \n\n \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\nIndia: he made it physically conscious of poor, uneducated, non\u00ac \npolitical India. Khadi was an adventure in identification between \nleadership and nation. Gandhi was prescribing for a disease which \nplagued independent India and most independent countries. \nHe knew that the tragedy of India\u2019s history was the canyon be\u00ac \ntween the gold-silver-silk-brocade-jewel-elephant splendour of \nher palaces and the animal poverty of her hovels; at the bottom of \nthe canyon lay the debris of empires and the bones of millions of \ntheir victims. \n\nThe work exhausted Gandhi. Three or four stops a day for \nmeetings, a different place to stop every night, heavy correspond\u00ac \nence which he never neglected, and unnumbered personal inter\u00ac \nviews with men and women who sought his word on the biggest \npolitical problems and their smallest personal difficulties \u2014 all in \nthe great heat and humidity \u2014 wore him down. In November \n, therefore, he undertook a seven-day fast. \n\nIndia worried about him and protested. Why a fast? \u2018The \npublic will have to neglect my fasts and cease to worry about \nthem,\u2019 Gandhi stated. \u2018They are part of my being. I can as well \ndo without my eyes, for instance, as I can without fasts. What the \neyes are for the outer world, fasts are for the inner.\u2019 He would \nfast whenever the spirit moved him. The result, to be sure, might \nbe disastrous. \u2018I may be wholly wrong,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018Then the \nworld will be able to write an epitaph over my ashes: \u201cWell \ndeserved, thou fool.\u201d But for the time being, my error, if it be \none, must sustain me.\u2019 This was a personal fast; \u2018this fast has \nnothing to do with the public\u2019. It is said \u2018I am public property \n. . . So be it. But I must be taken with all my faults. I am a \nsearcher after truth. My experiments I hold to be infinitely more \nimportant than the best-equipped Himalayan expeditions.\u2019 He \nwas trying to scale the spiritual heights; he thought fasts conduced \nto mental ascendancy over the body. \n\nGandhi\u2019s fast brought him a tide of requests for his views on \nfasting; even in India his frequent abstentions from food were \nunusual. He gave his response in a Young India article. \u2018With \napologies to my medical friends\u2019, it read, \u2018but out of the fullness \nof my own experience and that of fellow-cranks, I say without \nhesitation, Fast () if you are constipated, () if you are anaemic, \n() if you are feverish, () if you have indigestion, () if you have \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\na headache, () if you are rheumatic, () if you are gouty, () if \nyou are fretting and foaming, () if you are depressed, () if \nyou are overjoyed, and you will avoid medical prescriptions and \npatent medicines.  His patent medical prescription for every\u00ac \nthing was fasting. c Eat only when you are hungry ,  he added, \u2018and \nwhen you have laboured for your food.  \n\nHis highest weight after being discharged from prison in \nFebruary , he wrote in the same article, was  pounds. \nHe was down to  pounds when he started the fast. In the \nseven days he lost nine pounds but regained it quickly. Physically, \nhe said, he lost nothing either from this fast or from the twenty- \none-day fast in . \n\nWater during fasts nauseated him without a pinch of salt or \nbicarbonate of soda or a few drops of citrus juice. He never \nsuffered any pangs of hunger during the fast; in fact, \u2018I broke it \nhalf an hour later than I need have.  He spun every day and \nattended the daily prayer meetings. The first three days of the \nfast, he wrote, \u2018I worked practically from four in the morning \ntill eight in the evening,  doing articles, answering letters, giving \ninterviews. On the fourth day, his head ached. He accordingly \nabandoned work for a day; on the seventh day \u2018I was able to \nwrite with a steady hand my article on the fast.  \n\nThe article furnished nine rules for fasting; he himself broke the \nfirst which was \u2018Conserve your energy both physical and mental \nfrom the very beginning, () You must cease to think of food while \nyou are fasting, () Drink as much cold water as you can . . . \n() Have a warm sponge daily, () Take an enema regularly dur\u00ac \ning fast. You will be surprised at the impurities you will expel \ndaily, () Sleep as much as possible in the open air, () Bathe in \nthe morning air. A sun and air bath is at least as great a purifier \nas a water bath, () Think of anything else but your fast, () No \nmatter from what motive you are fasting, during this precious \ntime think of your Maker and of your relation to Him and His \nother creations and you will make discoveries you may not have \ndreamed of.  \n\nIt was for these discoveries that he fasted. \n\nGandhi\u2019s year as president of Congress was now ended and at \nCawnpore, in December , he relinquished the gavel to Mrs. \nSarojini Naidu, mistress of lyric words. Gandhi then took a vow \n\n \n\n\nFUNDS AND JEWELS \n\nof a year\u2019s \u2018political silence\u2019. \u2018At least up to twentieth December \nnext,\u2019 he announced in Young India of January th, , \u2018I am \nnot to stir out of the ashram, certainly not out of Ahmedahad\u2019 \nacross the river. Body and soul needed rest. \n\nThe Swaraj party, which had sent its people into the legislative \ncouncils to obstruct the British government, veered slowly towards \na measure of co-operation. A dissident group, headed by M. R. \nJayakar and N. G. Kelkar, who believed in still more co-operation \nwith the British, but less with the Moslems, split off from the \nSwarajists and formed the Responsivist party. It leaned towards \nthe Hindu Mahasabha, a religious political party. In December \n, the Moslem League session at Aligarh, attended by Jinnah, \nMohamed Ali and Sir Ali Imam, moved in the direction of \nreligious politics. Gandhi had hoped to unite India for nationalist \nliberation. But she was splitting at her religious seam. Political \nIndia, Gandhi found, was \u2018disrupted and demoralized\u2019. It seemed \na good time for silence. \u2018Silence\u2019, he quoted, \u2018is the true language \nof cosmic adoration.\u2019 \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER XI \n\n\nOPERATION AND FAST \nN the evening of January th, , Mahatma Gandhi \n\n\n\nwas hastily carried from Yeravda Central Prison, where he \n\n\nV-/ was lodged on March th, , to Sassoon Hospital in \nthe city of Poona. He had developed acute appendicitis. The \nGovernment was ready to wait for Indian physicians to arrive \nfrom Bombay, three hours\u2019 distance by train, but shortly before \nmidnight Colonel Maddock, the British surgeon, informed Gandhi \nthat he would have to operate immediately. Gandhi consented. \n\nWhile the operating theatre was being prepared, V. S. Srinivasa \nSastri, head of the Servants of India Society, and Dr. Phatak, \nPoona friend of the Mahatma, were summoned at his request. \nTogether, they drafted a public statement which declared that he \nhad agreed to the operation, that the physicians had treated him \nwell and that, whatever happened, there must be no anti-govern\u00ac \nment agitation. The hospital authorities, and Gandhi, knew that \nif the operation went badly India might burst into flames. \n\nWhen the declaration was ready, Gandhi drew up his knees and \nsigned it in pencil. \u2018See how my hand trembles,\u2019 he remarked to \nColonel Maddock with a laugh. \u2018You will have to put this right.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 replied the surgeon, \u2018we will put tons and tons of strength \ninto it.\u2019 \n\nChloroform was administered and a photograph taken. During \nthe operation, a thunderstorm cut off the supply of electricity. \nThen the flashlight which one of the three nurses had been holding \nwent out, and the operation had to be finished by the light of a \nhurricane lamp. \n\nThe appendicectomy was successful and the Mahatma thanked \nthe surgeon profusely. An abscess formed locally, however, and \nthe patient\u2019s progress was too slow. The Government thought it \nwise or generous in these circumstances to release Gandhi on \nFebruary th. \n\nThe operation piqued Gandhi\u2019s curiosity, and when Manu \nGandhi, the granddaughter of his cousin, had to undergo an \n\n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nappendicectomy at Patna, in Bihar province, during a tour, the \nMahatma asked the surgeon, Dr. D. P. Bhargava, the same who \nwas first to reach Gandhi\u2019s side after the assassination, whether \nhe could be present. Dr. Bhargava assented on condition that \nGandhi wore a gauze mask, and two snapshots taken during the \noperation show Gandhi sitting on a chair, an unusual perch, with \na white mask covering the lower half of his face and tied around \nthe back of his head. Dr. Bhargava says Gandhi did not utter a \nword during the entire hour. (This was on May th, , at \n. p.m.) \n\n\u2018The West\u2019, Gandhi once wrote to Miss Slade, \u2018has always com\u00ac \nmanded my admiration for its surgical inventions and all-round \nprogress in that direction.\u2019 \n\nNevertheless, Gandhi never quite cast off his prejudices against \nphysicians. Once Gandhi resisted a penicillin injection. \n\n\u2018If I give you penicillin\u2019, the doctor said, \u2018you will recover in \nthree days. Otherwise it will take three weeks.\u2019 \n\n\u2018That\u2019s all right,\u2019 Gandhi replied. \u2018I\u2019m in no hurry.\u2019 \n\nThe doctor said he might infect others. \n\n\u2018Then give them penicillin\u2019, Gandhi advised. \n\nIn an unguarded moment, the same physician told Gandhi that \nif all sick people simply went to bed they\u2019d get well. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019t say that aloud,\u2019 Gandhi cautioned. \u2018You will lose all \nyour patients.\u2019 \n\nGandhi liked to be his own doctor. Mahadev Desai, who knew \nhim well, said, \u2018But for his fundamental objection to vivisection, \nhe might have been a physician and a surgeon.\u2019 Gandhi wrote a \nbook on health, and loved to recommend \u2018quack\u2019 remedies to \nfriends, callers and all of India. Accordingly, when he received \nhis unconditional discharge from Yeravda Jail and went to the \nbeach at Juhu, near Bombay, to recuperate in the home of \nShantikumar Morarjee, an industrialist, he decided that since \nhe would be doctoring himself he might as well doctor others too; \nhe converted the seaside villa into a temporary hospital where \nailing associates, summoned from near and far, gave Gandhi \npleasure by submitting to his mud packs, water baths, food fads \nand massage. Chiefly, however, he advanced his and their con\u00ac \nvalescence with the medicine of laughter and companionship. \n\nOthers came to Juhu too \u2014 unasked \u2014 and Gandhi appealed to \n\n \n\n\nOPERATION AND FAST \n\n\nthem through the press to come, if they must, between  and  in \nthe evening for prayers on the sands. But \u2018seeing me  , he explained, \n\u2018is not likely to be of benefit to you. It is an indication of your \nlove for me, but it is an exaggerated indication\u2019. It would be much \nbetter to spend the money and time on spinning. If they gave him \npeace he could husband his \u2018very small . . . capital of energy\u2019 and \nresume the active editorship of Young India , his \u2018viewspaper\u2019, and \nNavajivan , which he did on April rd, . \n\nTo Juhu, too, came G. R. Das and Motilal Nehru for discussions \non the ugly situation that had arisen during the twenty-two \nmonths Gandhi spent in prison. \n\nFirst, Hindu-Moslem friendship, the firm rock on which Gandhi \nhoped to build a united, free India, had been all but submerged \nin an angry tide of hostility between the two communities. The \nKhilafat movement was dead, killed not by Britain, but by Kemal \nPasha (Ataturk), the master of Moslem Turkey. Wiser than most \nof his Indian co-religionists, Kemal had created a secular republic, \nLatinized the cursive Arabic script, proscribed the fez and other \nOriental head-dress and, having deposed the Caliph, allowed him \nto flee to the island of Malta in a British man-of-war in November \n. A weak heir clung to the illusion of the Caliph\u2019s religious \nprimacy, but in March  he too became a refugee. \n\nLeft without a cause, the Khilafat movement disintegrated. \nTherewith, large-scale Hindu-Moslem political collaboration \ncame to an end. \n\nSecond, the non-co-operation movement was dead. \u2018Scores of \nlawyers have resumed practice,\u2019 Gandhi said, summarizing what \nhe was told at Juhu and what he learned first-hand. \u2018Some even \nregret having given it up . . . Hundreds of boys and girls who \ngave up government schools and colleges have repented of their \naction and returned to them.\u2019 Moreover, Motilal Nehru, C. R. \nDas and their many adherents favoured a return to the municipal, \nprovincial and national legislative councils. This, they main\u00ac \ntained, would enable them to participate in elections, keep in \ntouch with the people, air grievances in the deliberative assem\u00ac \nblies and obstruct the British government. Indeed, in some cases \nthe Government might lack a majority in the councils and be \nforced to rule by administrative fiat, thus unmasking the sham \nof dyarchy and showing the British nation that their imperialist \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nleaders were not ready to share power with Indians. This demon\u00ac \nstration might induce England to alter the system in India. \n\nTo carry out their programme, Das and the elder Nehru had, at \nthe end of , launched the Swaraj (Home-Rule) Party whose \n\u2018immediate\u2019 aim was Dominion Status within the Empire. \n\nThose who continued to uphold Gandhi\u2019s non-violent non-co- \noperation were called No-Changers. The two factions wanted \nSwaraj but had been fighting like bitter enemies. A compromise \ngiving them freedom of action kept both inside the Congress. \n\nConfronted with this picture at Juhu, Gandhi entered into the \nGandhi-Das Pact which confirmed the live-and-let-live arrange\u00ac \nment between the Gandhians and the Swaraj party. He did not \nwant to split Congress. \n\nGandhi was still a non-co-operator, still a champion of civil \ndisobedience and \u2018a strong disbeliever in this government\u2019, he \ndeclared in Young India of April th, . He would therefore \nhave pressed the boycott of the courts, schools and government \njobs and titles. But the Gandhians had grown discouraged during \nhis absence in jail. The boycott involved tremendous personal \nsacrifice which few could bear. The Swaraj party\u2019s policy, on the \nother hand, was alluring. It meant election victories, membership \nin legislatures, speech-making, etc. Gandhi had no short-range \nprogramme to match it. He accordingly withdrew from Indian \npolitics for several years and devoted himself to purifying India. \nSwaraj depended on how good India was, not how bad the British \nwere. \u2018My belief is that the instant India is purified India be\u00ac \ncomes free and not a moment earlier,\u2019 he wrote \u2018Charlie\u2019 Andrews. \n\nGandhi\u2019s purpose, during this period of withdrawal from \npolitics, was to foster the brotherhood of man among Indians. \nLooking around, it soon became obvious to him that \u2018the only \nquestion for immediate solution before the country is the Hindu- \nMoslem question. I agree with Mr. Jinnah,\u2019 he added, \u2018that \nHindu-Moslem unity means Swaraj . . . There is no question \nmore important and more pressing than this\u2019. \n\nGreat editor that he was, Gandhi dedicated the entire May th, \n, issue of Young India to his ooo-word article on \u2018Hindu- \nMoslem Tension, its Causes and Cure\u2019. After recording the Hindu \ncharges against Moslems (\u2018Mussulmans\u2019, he called them) and the \nMoslem countercharges and noting the growth of quarrels, \n\n \n\n\nOPERATION AND FAST \n\ndisputes and riots between the communities, he expressed the \nopinion that all this was \u2018a reaction against the spread of non\u00ac \nviolence. I feel the wave of violence coming. The Hindu-Moslem \ntension is an acute phase of this tiredness\u2019. \n\nWhat would cure this loss of faith in non-violence, Gandhi \nasked. Non-violence, he answered. \n\nGandhi\u2019s lengthy article was advocacy rather than analysis. \nHe believed in the immediate possibility of Hindu-Moslem \nfriendship \u2018because it is so natural, so necessary for both and \nbecause I believe in human nature\u2019. That is almost all of Gandhi \nin one sentence. \n\n\u2018The key to the situation lies with the Hindus,\u2019 he wrote. The \n\u2018two constant causes of friction\u2019 with the Moslems were cow- \nslaughter and music. \n\n\u2018Though I regard cow protection as the central fact of Hinduism \n[Gandhi declared], I have never been able to understand the \nantipathy towards the Mussulmans on that score. We say nothing \nabout the slaughter [of cows] that daily takes place on behalf of \nEnglishmen. Our anger becomes red-hot when a Mussulman \nslaughters a cow. All the riots that have taken place in the name \nof the cow have been an insane waste of effort. They have not \nsaved a single cow, but they have on the contrary stiffened the \nbacks of the Mussulmans and resulted in more slaughter. I am \nsatisfied that during  more cows were saved through the \nvoluntary and generous effort of the Mussulmans than through \nthe Hindu effort during all the previous twenty years, say. Cow \nprotection should commence with ourselves. In no part of the \nworld are cattle worse treated than in India . . . The half-starved \ncondition of the majority of our cattle are a disgrace to us. The \ncows find their necks under the butcher\u2019s knife because Hindus \nsell them. The only effective and honourable way is to befriend \nthe Mussulmans and leave it to their honour to save the cow. Cow \nprotection societies must turn their attention to the feeding of \ncattle, prevention of cruelty, preservation of the fast disappearing \npasture land, improving the breed of cattle. . . .\u2019 \n\nThen there was the music played in Hindu religious processions \nas they passed mosques at prayer time. Somehow, the processions \ncontrived to arrive in front of mosques just when the followers of \nthe Prophet were supplicating Allah. Gandhi had heard that \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nHindus sometimes did this \u2018with the deliberate intention of irri? \ntating Mussulmans\u2019. This was as wrong as the Moslem resort \nto violence in angry retaliation. \n\nGandhi\u2019s long article ignored the social-economic reasons for \nthe exacerbation of intercommunity relations except in one \nreference to the Moslem demand that a percentage of jobs in the \nGovernment be reserved for them. A Moslem middle class was \nbeginning to emerge in India (and throughout the Arab world); \nit found itself handicapped in competing with Hindus, Parsis and \nChristians who had the advantages of better education and \nbetter connections. The Moslems therefore wanted a certain \nnumber of jobs kept for them irrespective of their qualifications. \nGandhi objected. He said, \n\nTor administration to be efficient it must be in the hands of the \nfittest. There should certainly be no favouritism. If we want \nfive engineers we must not take one from each community but we \nmust take the fittest five even if they were all Mussulmans or all \nParsis . . . The educationally backward communities will have a \nright to favoured treatment in the matter of education at the \nhands of the national government. . . But those who aspire to \noccupy responsible posts in the government of the country can \nonly do so if they pass the required test.\u2019 \n\nThis was logical, fair and sensible, but completely unsatisfactory \nto the Moslems. And since the economic backwardness of India \nmade government employment one of the major, if not the major, \nindustries of the country, the reservation of official jobs for Moham\u00ac \nmedans remained a sore point as long as British rule lasted. \n\nIn the seven hundred thousand villages of India, Hindus and \nMoslems had always lived together in peace. The Hindu-Moslem \ntension of the twentieth century was a man-made, middle-class, \nurban disease. Indians are often ambitious and dynamic. A \ncity like Bombay throbs with vitality. The inhumanly crowded \ntowns, with their herring-barrel tenements and the frustration \nwhich comes from animal-like poverty and the very limited \nopportunities to earn, learn and advance, make urban Indians \neasily excitable \u2014 especially in the maddening heat of the long \nsummer. In cities, Gandhi\u2019s non-violence contended with nature \nas well as human nature. \n\nGandhi, the optimistic Karma yogi, regarded difficulties as \n\n \n\n\nOPERATION AND FAST \n\n\nspurs to greater exertions of will. The editor who gave an entire \nissue of his magazine to a problem was the doer who would give \nhis whole life to solve it. On September th, , therefore, \nGandhi started a twenty-one-day fast for Hindu-Moslem friendship. \n\nGandhi had been ill for months in jail. Then came the urgent \nappendicectomy. The wound suppurated and healed slowly. \nConvalescence was retarded. Weeks of tense talks followed by \nweeks of strenuous touring wore him out. The political situation \ndepressed him; years of work seemed to have been lost. At a \nconference of the All-India Congress Committee in June, when he \nrealized how many , of his associates really did not believe in non\u00ac \nviolence, he wept in public. The steady stream of reports on \nHindu-Moslem fighting and the atmosphere of bickering, hate and \ngloom weighed heavily on his body and spirit. He was fifty-five. \nHe knew that a twenty-one-day fast might be fatal. He did not \nwant to die. There were too many unfinished tasks. He revelled \nin life. Suicide was religiously and physically repugnant to him. \nThe fast was no tryst with death. It gave him no pleasure to \nsuffer. The fast was dictated by duty to the highest cause \u2014 the \nuniversal brotherhood of man. \n\nFor Gandhi, an act had to be right and true. Then he never \ncounted the cost to himself or even to others; in this sense, he was \nwithout mercy. Service meant sacrifice, renunciation and detach\u00ac \nment. You detach yourself from yourself. All that remains is \nduty. On September th, , Gandhi felt it his duty to fast. \n\nGandhi always kept his eye on his objective and when he could \nnot see it he kept his eye on the spot where he thought it would \nappear. He also had an eye for drama. He fasted in the home \nof a Moslem, Mohamed Ali, the younger brother of Shaukat. \nMohamed Ali was a staunch Congress supporter, a champion \nof Hindu-Moslem friendship. But the Moslem community was \nmoving away from him. Gandhi had said in his article that \u2018the \nkey to the situation lies with the Hindus\u2019, but with his heart, \nthe senior partner of his mind, he knew that Moslems were the \noffenders; conditions, he said, were making the Moslem \u2018a bully\u2019. \nGandhi wished to strengthen Mohamed Ali\u2019s hand. \u2018It is our \nduty\u2019, he once wrote, \u2018to strengthen by our fasting those who hold \nthe same ideals but are likely to weaken under pressure.\u2019 For \ntwenty-one days India\u2019s attention would be focused on the house \n\nq, m.g.  \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nwhere Gandhi lay fasting. Moslems would see that Mohandas \nand Mohamed were brothers. Hindus, moreover, would note \nthat their saint had confided his life to a Moslem. \n\nNo personal benefit could come to Gandhi from the fast; on \nthe contrary. Nor was there any element of compulsion in it. \nThe Moslem in Calcutta or Agra, the Hindu in Amritsar or \nAllahabad would not be compelled to change their conduct be\u00ac \ncause Gandhi was dying for Hindu-Moslem amity. They would \nchange, if at all, because the Mahatma\u2019s great sacrifice established \na spiritual bond between him and them, a kind of common wave\u00ac \nlength, a means of communication over which he conveyed to \nthem the importance, the necessity, the urgency, the sacredness \nof the cause for which he was fasting. It was his way of going out \nto them, of entering their hearts, of uniting himself with them. \n\nIn part, this is Eastern, Indian. The bridges of the West are \nmade of concrete, steel, wire, words. Eastern bridges are of spirit. \nTo communicate, the West moves or talks. The East sits, con\u00ac \ntemplates, suffers. Gandhi partook of West and East. When \nWestern methods failed him, he used Eastern methods. \n\nThe fast was an adventure in goodness. The stake was one man\u2019s \nlife. The prize was a nation\u2019s freedom. If Indians were united as \nbrothers, no outsider could long be their master. The British \nofficial report on conditions in India in  remarked, \u00a3 One \nnoticeable feature of the general excitement was the unpre\u00ac \ncedented fraternization between the Hindus and the Moham\u00ac \nmedans.\u2019 In , Gandhi felt that the fraternization, and with it \nfreedom, was ebbing away. Hence the ordeal under his Moslem \nbrother\u2019s roof. \n\n\u2018Nothing evidently which I say or write can bring the two \ncommunities together,\u2019 he declared in announcing the fast. T am \ntherefore imposing on myself a twenty-one-day fast from today \nand ending Wednesday October th. I reserve the liberty to \ndrink water with or without salt. It is both a penance and a \nprayer ... I respectfully invite the heads of all communities, \nincluding Englishmen, to meet and end this quarrel which is a \ndisgrace to religion and to humanity. It seems as if God has been \ndethroned. Let us reinstate Him in our hearts.\u2019 \n\nTwo Moslem physicians were in constant attendance. Charles \nFreer Andrews, the Christian missionary, served as nurse. \n\n \n\n\nOPERATION AND FAST \n\n\nOn the second day of the fast, Gandhi wrote a page-long plea \nfor Young India on \u2018unity in diversity  . \u2018The need of the moment  , \nhe stressed, \u2018is not one religion but mutual respect and tolerance \nof the devotees of the different religions.  On the sixth day with\u00ac \nout food he wrote a page article which ended, \u2018To paraphrase a \nBiblical verse, if it is no profanation, \u201cSeek you first Hindu-Moslem \nunity, removal of untouchability and the spinning wheel and \nKhaddar [homespun] and everything will be added unto you  .  \n\nTwelve days after the fast commenced he wrote  words for \npublication: \u2018Hitherto it has been a struggle and a yearning for a \nchange of heart among Englishmen who compose the government \nof India. That change has still to come. But the struggle must for \nthe moment be transferred to a change of heart among the Hindus \nand the Mussulmans. Before they dare think of freedom they \nmust be brave enough to love one another, to tolerate one an\u00ac \nother\u2019s religion, even prejudices and superstitions, and to trust \none another. This requires faith in oneself. And faith in oneself \nis faith in God. If we have that faith we shall cease to fear one \nanother.  \n\nThe twentieth day he dictated a prayer: \u2018Presently from the \nworld of peace I shall enter the world of strife. The more I think \nof it the more helpless I feel ... I know that I can do nothing. \nGod can do everything. O! God, make me Thy instrument and \nuse me as Thou wilt. Man is nothing. Napoleon planned much \nand found himself a prisoner in St. Helena. The mighty Kaiser \naimed at the crown of Europe and is reduced to the status of a \nprivate gentleman. God has so willed it. Let us contemplate \nsuch examples and be humble.  The twenty days had been \u2018days \nof grace, privilege and peace  . \n\nThat evening \u2018Mahatma Gandhi was wonderfully bright and \ncheerful,  Andrews wrote. \u2018Many of his most intimate friends \ncame to see him as he lay upon his bed on the open roof of the \nhouse, which was flooded by the moonlight.  They prayed. \n\u2018Then followed a long silence. The friends parted one by one and \nhe was left alone.  \n\nThe twenty-first day: \u2018Before four o\u2019clock in the morning . . . \nwe were called for the morning prayers,  Andrews recorded. \n\u2018There was no moon and it was very dark. A chili breeze was \nblowing from the east . . . Bapu was wrapped warmly in a dark \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nshawl and I asked him whether he had slept well. He replied, \n\u201cYes, very well indeed.\u201d It was a happiness to notice at once \nthat his voice was stronger than the morning before, instead of \nweaker.\u2019 After prayers, many people came for darshan, a sight \nthat blesses. \n\nAt about io a.m. (Andrews writes), Mahatmaji called for me \nand said, \u2018Can you remember the words of my favourite Christian \nhymn?\u2019 \n\nI sajd, \u2018Yes, shall I sing it to you now?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Not now,\u2019 he answered, \u2018but I have in mind that when I \nbreak my fast, we might have a little ceremony expressing religious \nunity. I should like the Imam Sahib to recite the opening verses \nof the Koran. Then I would like you to sing the Christian hymn, \nyou know the one I mean, it begins, \u201cWhen I survey the wondrous \nCross\u201d and ends with the words, \n\nLove so amazing, so divine, \n\nDemands my soul, my life, my all. \n\nAnd then last of all I should like Vinoba to recite from the \nUpanishads and Balkrishna to sing the Vaishnava hymn . . .\u2019 He \nwanted all the servants present. \n\nNow at last the midday hour had come and the fast was to be \nbroken. \n\nThe doctors went to Gandhi\u2019s room; the Ali brothers, Maulana \nAbu! Kalam Azad, Motilal Nehru, C. R. Das and many others \nsat on the floor near the bed. Before the actual breaking of the \nfast, Gandhi spoke, \u2018and as he spoke his emotion was so deep that \nin his bodily weakness his voice could hardly be heard except by \nthose who were nearest of all to him\u2019. He asked them to lay down \ntheir lives, if need be, for the cause of brotherhood. The Moslem \nleaders renewed their pledge. Then the hymns were sung. \u2018Dr. \nAnsari brought forward some orange juice and Mahatma Gandhi \ndrank it. So the fast was broken.\u2019 \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER XVIII \n\n\nON THE WAY HOME \n\n\na n D h i sent apologies to persons and groups in almost every \n\n\n\nfree country of the world; he could not visit them because \n\n\nVJ he had work to do in India, On the way home, he stopped \nfor a day in Paris. Sitting on a table, he addressed a large meeting \nin a cinema theatre, and then took the train for Switzerland, \nwhere he stayed five days with Romain Rolland at Villeneuve, \nat the eastern end of Lake Leman. \n\nRolland, whose Jean Christophe is a literary masterpiece of the \ntwentieth century, had come under the influence of Count Leo \nTolstoy, author of the finest novel of the nineteenth. Rolland \nmade a shrewd comparison between Tolstoy and Gandhi. \u2018With \nGandhi/ he said in , 'everything is nature \u2014 modest, simple, \npure \u2014 while all his struggles are hallowed by religious serenity, \nwhereas with Tolstoy everything is proud revolt against pride, \nhatred against hatred, passion against passion. Everything in \nTolstoy is violence, even his doctrine of non-violence.\u2019 \n\nTolstoy was storm-tossed, Gandhi calm and equable. Gandhi \ncould not have fled from his wife, or from anything. The market \nplace in which he sat was crisscrossed by hundreds of millions of \npersons with their wares and carts and cares and thoughts, but \nhe sat still and there was silence in him and around him. Gandhi \nwould have suffocated in an ivory tower or on an Olympian \nheight. \n\nTagore was different. \u2018But where am I in a great crowd, \nsqueezed in at all sides?\u2019 Romain Rolland quotes Tagore as say\u00ac \ning. \u2018And who can understand the noise I hear? If I hear a song, \nmy sitar can catch the melody, and I can join the chorus, for I \nam a singer. But in the mad clamour of the crowd, my voice is \nlost, and I become dizzy.\u2019 \n\nRolland and Gandhi had never met before . Rolland knew \nGandhi from long conversations with Tagore and G. F. Andrews \nwho had lived for fifteen years with Tagore. He had also read \nGandhi. Like Tagore, Rolland was a singer. He was the author \n\n\ni \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nof books on Beethoven, Handel, Goethe and Michelangelo. He \nwrote a book on Ramakrishna, the Hindu mystic. \n\nRolland regarded Gandhi as a saint. In fact, he wrote in his \n biography of the Mahatma, \u2018Gandhi is too much of a saint; \nhe is too pure, too free from the animal passions that lie dormant \nin man.\u2019 Rolland and Tagore were afraid of the evil in human \nbeings. Tagore feared that when Gandhi lit bonfires of foreign \ncloth he would kindle uncontrollable emotions in men; Rolland \nagreed; Andrews agreed. \n\nThis estimate omits Gandhi\u2019s faith in the basic goodness and \ncorrigibility of man which is the essence of Gandhi. In South \nAfrica, Gandhi believed that the ordinary, illiterate, indentured \nlabourer in a mine or on a farm could rise to the purity and re\u00ac \nstraint required of a Satyagrahi. He trusted the peasants of back\u00ac \nward Bardoli to resist provocation and violence. His trust exalted \nthem. Gandhi did not regard nobility as a monopoly of the great \nman or the artist or the elite. Gandhi\u2019s uniqueness lay in working \nwith common clay and finding the soul-spark in it. \n\nBefore Gandhi\u2019s.arrival on December th, Rolland had received \nhundreds of letters connected with the Mahatma\u2019s visit: an Italian \nwanted to know from Gandhi what numbers would win in the \nnext national lottery; a group of Swiss musicians offered to \nserenade Gandhi under his window every night; the Syndicate of \nthe Milkmen of Leman volunteered to supply \u2018the King of India\u2019 \nwith dairy products during his stay. Journalists sent question\u00ac \nnaires and camped around Rolland\u2019s villa; photographers laid \nsiege to the house; the police reported that the hotels had filled \nwith tourists who hoped to see the Indian visitor. \n\nThe two men, Gandhi sixty-two, Rolland sixty-five, met like \nold friends and treated one another with the tenderness of mutual \nrespect. Gandhi arrived on a cold rainy evening with Miss Slade, \nMahadev Desai, Pyarelal Nayyar and Devadas. The next day \nwas Monday, Gandhi\u2019s day of silence, and Rolland delivered a \nninety-minute talk on the tragic moral and social state of Europe \nsince . Gandhi listened and pencilled some questions. \n\nOn Tuesday, they discussed Gandhi\u2019s trip to Rome. He wanted \nto see Mussolini and other Italian leaders as well as the Pope. \nRolland warned him that the Fascist regime would exploit his \npresence for its sinister purposes. Gandhi said he would break \n\n \n\n\nON THE WAY HOME \n\n\nthrough the cordon they might throw around him. Rolland \nsuggested that he put certain conditions. Gandhi replied that it \nwas against his convictions to make such arrangements in advance. \nRolland persisted. Gandhi said, \u2018Then tell me, what is your final \nopinion on my plan to stop in Rome ?  Rolland advised him to \nstay with some independent persons. Gandhi promised and kept \nthe promise. \n\nRolland asked Gandhi to comment on his remarks about \nEurope. Gandhi said it showed him how vast had been Rolland\u2019s \nsuffering. Speaking English which Rolland\u2019s sister translated into \nFrench, Gandhi said he had learned very little from history. \u2018My \nmethod is empiric ,  he explained. \u2018All my conclusions are based \non personal experience .  This, he admitted, could be dangerous \nand misleading, but he had to have faith in his own views. All \nhis trust was in non-violence. It could save Europe. In England, \nfriends tried to show him the weakness of his non-violent method; \n\u2018but even though the whole world doubt it, I will continue to \nbelieve in it  . \n\nThe next two days Gandhi spent in Lausanne where he \naddressed a public meeting and in Geneva where he spoke m \nVictory Hall. At each he was heckled for hours by atheists and \nothers. He answered them in perfect calm, \u2018not a muscle of his \nface twitching  , Rolland wrote. \n\nOn December ioth, they resumed their conversation. Rolland \nrecalled Gandhi\u2019s statement at Geneva: \u2018Truth is God .  He gave \nGandhi a brief sketch of his life, his childhood, how cramped he \nfelt in the small French town, how he became a writer and \nstruggled with the problem of the truth in art. \u2018If it is correct  , \nRolland said, \u2018that \u201cTruth is God  , it appears to me that it lacks \none important attribute of God: joy. For \u2014 and on this I insist \u2014 \nI recognize no God without joy .  \n\nGandhi replied that he did not distinguish between art and \ntruth. \u2018I am against the formula, \u201cArt for art\u2019s sake\u201d. For me, \nall art must be based on the truth. I reject beautiful things if, \ninstead of expressing truth, they express untruth. I accept the \nformula \u201cArt brings joy and is good\u201d but on the condition I men\u00ac \ntioned. To achieve truth in art I do not expect exact reproductions \nof external things. Only living things bring living joy to the soul \nand must elevate the soul .  \n\n\n X  \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nRolland did not differ but he stressed the pain of searching for \ntruth and for God. He took a book from his shelf and read from \nGoethe. Rolland later confessed that he thought Gandhi\u2019s God \nfound pleasure in man\u2019s sorrow; Rolland was trying to modify \nthis Gandhian view. \n\nThey talked about the perils of another war. Tf one nation \npossessed the heroism to submit without answering violence with \nviolence,\u2019 Gandhi declared, \u2018it would be the most effective lesson. \nBut for this an absolute faith is necessary.\u2019 \n\nRolland: \u2018Nothing should be done by halves, no matter whether \nit is bad or good.\u2019 Rolland\u2019s sister, Madeleine, and Miss Konda- \nchev, a Russian secretary, were taking notes. Neither recorded \nGandhi\u2019s reaction to this assertion. \n\nThe last day, December nth, Rolland requested Gandhi to \ndeal with some questions submitted by Pierre Monatte, the editor \nof a Paris magazine called The Proletarian Revolution . In response \nto one query, Gandhi asserted that if labour was perfectly \norganized it could dictate conditions to the employers; \u2018labour is \nthe only power in the world\u2019. But Rolland interposed that the \ncapitalists might divide the workers; there might be scabs; \u2018then \nthe conscious minority of labour must set up a dictatorship of the \nproletariat and force the mass of labour to unite in its own \ninterest\u2019. \n\n\u2018I am absolutely opposed to that,\u2019 Gandhi affirmed. Rolland \ndropped the subject and quickly introduced several others: non\u00ac \nviolence in relation to criminals, etc. etc., and \u2018What do you call \nGod? Is it a spiritual personality or a force.which rules over the \nworld?\u2019 \n\n\u2018God,\u2019 Gandhi replied, \u2018is not a person . . . God is an eternal \nprinciple. That is why I say that Truth is God . . . Even atheists \ndo not doubt the necessity of truth.\u2019 \n\nThe last evening Gandhi asked Rolland to play some Beethoven. \nRolland played the Andante from the Fifth Symphony and, as an \nencore of his own accord, Gluck\u2019s \u2018Elysian Fields\u2019. \n\nThe theme of the Fifth Symphony is considered to be man\u2019s \nstruggle with fate, man\u2019s harmony with fate, the brotherhood of \nman. The second movement, the Andante, is melodious and \nsuffused with tender lyrical emotions, quiet nobility and optimism. \nRolland chose it because it came closest to his concept of Gandhi\u2019s \n\n \n\n\nON THE WAY HOME \n\n\npersonality. It is gentle and loving. In the Gluck piece one almost \nhears the angels singing to the strains of the flute. It is celestial \nmusic, full of purity and clarity. The Gita might be set to it. \n\nRolland was frail and had just recovered from bronchitis, but \nhe insisted on taking Gandhi and his party to the railway station. \nThere they embraced, as they did when they first met; Gandhi \npressed his cheek against Rolland\u2019s shoulder and threw his right \narm around Rolland; Rolland touched his cheek to Gandhi\u2019s \nhead. \u2018It was the kiss of St. Dominic and St. Francis,\u2019 Rolland \nsaid. \n\nThe Italian government wished Gandhi to be its guest and \nmade the corresponding preparations. Gandhi politely refused \nand stayed with General Moris, a friend of Rolland\u2019s, who had \nlived in India. The day of his arrival, the Mahatma went to see \nthe Duce. An official communique said the interview lasted \ntwenty minutes. Gandhi\u2019s companions recall that it lasted only \nten minutes. Gandhi could establish no psychological contact \nwith Mussolini. \u2018He has the eyes of a cat,\u2019 Gandhi said later; \n\u2018they moved about in every direction as if in constant rotation. \nThe visitor would totally succumb before the awe of his gaze like \na rat running directly into the mouth of a cat out of mere fright. \n\n\u2018I was not to be dazed like that,\u2019 Gandhi testified, \u2018but I noticed \nthat he had so arranged things about him that a visitor would \neasily get stricken with terror. The walls of the passage through \nwhich one has to pass to reach him are all overstudded with \nvarious types of swords and other weapons.* Mussolini\u2019s office, \ntoo, Gandhi noted, was hung with weapons, but, he added, \u2018he \nkeeps no arms on his person\u2019. \n\nThe Pope did not see Gandhi. Several members of Gandhi\u2019s \nentourage thought the Holy Father might have been acting in \ndeference to II Duce\u2019s wishes, but they did not know. Some sug\u00ac \ngested that the interview failed to materialize not only on account \nof Mussolini\u2019s relations with the Vatican but also because of \nAnglo-Italian relations; Gandhi, after all, was an anti-British \nrebel. \n\nGandhi was taken to the Rome-Naples rugby match and to a \nparade of the young Balilla Musketeers where he was received \nwith a salvo of cannon. He was more interested in the Vatican \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nLibrary, and spent two happy hours in St. Peter\u2019s. In the Sistine \nChapel he stood before Christ on the Cross and wept. \u2018One can\u00ac \nnot help being moved to tears,\u2019 he said to Mahadev Pesai. If he \ncould have lingered \u2018two or three months\u2019 in the museums and \nobserved the statues and paintings every day, Gandhi wrote to \nthe ashram, he might have an opinion that was worth while. \nEven then, \u2018I am hardly qualified as an art critic.\u2019 \n\nRomain Rolland, however, had directed his attention to art. \n\u2018I do not think that European art is superior to Indian art,\u2019 \nGandhi boasted. \u2018Both these arts have developed on different \nlines. Indian art is based entirely on the imagination,\u2019 he wrote \nto a friend; he was probably recalling the Indian statues with \nmany arms and heads. \u2018European art is an imitation of nature. \nIt is therefore easier to understand but turns our attention to the \nearth, whereas Indian art, when understood, tends to direct our \nthoughts to Heaven.\u2019 \n\nThen he checked himself. \u2018This is only for a person like you,\u2019 \nhe cautioned. \u2018I attach no importance to these views. It may be \nmy unconscious partiality for India or perhaps my ignorance that \nmakes me say this.\u2019 \n\nTo Gandhi, art had to be spiritual. \u2018True beauty\u2019, he said in \nhis autobiography, \u2018consists in purity of heart.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Jesus [he wrote in Young India ] was to my mind a supreme artist, \nbecause he saw and expressed Truth . . . But I know that many \ncall themselves artists, and are recognized as such, and yet in \ntheir work there is absolutely no trace of the soul\u2019s upward surge \nand unrest . . . True art is thus an expression of the soul . . . All \ntrue art must help the soul to realize its inner self. In my own \ncase, I find that I can do entirely without external forms in my \nsoul\u2019s realization. I can claim, therefore, that there is truly suffi\u00ac \ncient art in my life, though you might not see what you call works \nof art about me. My room may have blank walls. And I may \neven dispense with the roof, so that I may gaze upon the starry \nheavens overhead that stretch in an unending expanse of beauty \n. . . Is a woman with fair features necessarily beautiful? . . . \nSocrates, we are told, was the most truthful man of his time and \nyet his features are said to have been the ugliest in Greece. To \nmy mind he was beautiful because he was struggling after truth \n. . . Truth is the first thing to be sought for, and beauty and \n\n \n\n\nON THE WAY HOME \n\n\ngoodness will then be added unto you . . . True art takes note \nnot merely of form but also of what lies beyond. There is an art \nthat kills and an art that gives life. True art must be evidence of \nthe happiness, contentment and purity of its authors.\u2019 \n\nBefore Gandhi left Rome he sought out Tolstoy\u2019s daughter. \nAs he sat spinning on the floor of her apartment, Princess Maria, \na daughter of the King of Italy, entered with a lady-in-waiting, \nand brought the Mahatma a large basket of figs. \n\n\u2018Her Majesty the Queen packed them for you,\u2019 said the lady- \nin-waiting. \n\nNobody exploited Gandhi\u2019s presence for pro-Fascist purposes \nalthough the Giornale d'Italia did print an interview with him \nwhich he never gaye by a journalist he had never seen. Altogether, \nfrom Swiss border to the Italian heel, Gandhi spent forty-eight \nhours in italy. At Brindisi, he bade farewell to his two Scotland \nYard men, but not to Professor and Mrs. Edmond Privat. \n\nThe professor and his wife were friends of Romain Rolland and \naccompanied Gandhi from Villeneuve to the Italian frontier. As \nthey were saying goodbye they remarked that they would like \nsome day to visit India. Gandhi asked why they didn\u2019t come \nalong with him. They replied that they could not afford it. \n\n\u2018You probably think in terms of first and second class,\u2019 Gandhi \nsaid, \u2018but we only pay ten pounds each for our passage on deck, \nand once there, many Indian friends would open their houses to \nyou.\u2019 \n\nThe Privats counted the money in their pockets and purse and \ndecided to go. At Rome they bought bedding, sent telegrams to \nthe University of Neuchatel, where the professor taught, that he \nwould not be back for his lectures, and on December th boarded \nthe S.S. Pilsna at Brindisi with the Gandhi party. Two weeks later \nthey landed at Bombay. \n\nA mammoth crowd cheered Gandhi\u2019s arrival on the morning \nof December th. \u2018I have come back empty-handed,\u2019 he told \nthem, \u2018but I have not compromised the honour of my country.\u2019 \nThat was his summary of how India had fared at the Round \nTable Conference. But things were blacker than he thought. \n\n\nM.G. \n\n\nx \n\n\n* \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER XI \n\n\nOPERATION AND FAST \nN the evening of January th, , Mahatma Gandhi \n\n\n\nwas hastily carried from Yeravda Central Prison, where he \n\n\nV-/ was lodged on March th, , to Sassoon Hospital in \nthe city of Poona. He had developed acute appendicitis. The \nGovernment was ready to wait for Indian physicians to arrive \nfrom Bombay, three hours\u2019 distance by train, but shortly before \nmidnight Colonel Maddock, the British surgeon, informed Gandhi \nthat he would have to operate immediately. Gandhi consented. \n\nWhile the operating theatre was being prepared, V. S. Srinivasa \nSastri, head of the Servants of India Society, and Dr. Phatak, \nPoona friend of the Mahatma, were summoned at his request. \nTogether, they drafted a public statement which declared that he \nhad agreed to the operation, that the physicians had treated him \nwell and that, whatever happened, there must be no anti-govern\u00ac \nment agitation. The hospital authorities, and Gandhi, knew that \nif the operation went badly India might burst into flames. \n\nWhen the declaration was ready, Gandhi drew up his knees and \nsigned it in pencil. \u2018See how my hand trembles,\u2019 he remarked to \nColonel Maddock with a laugh. \u2018You will have to put this right.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 replied the surgeon, \u2018we will put tons and tons of strength \ninto it.\u2019 \n\nChloroform was administered and a photograph taken. During \nthe operation, a thunderstorm cut off the supply of electricity. \nThen the flashlight which one of the three nurses had been holding \nwent out, and the operation had to be finished by the light of a \nhurricane lamp. \n\nThe appendicectomy was successful and the Mahatma thanked \nthe surgeon profusely. An abscess formed locally, however, and \nthe patient\u2019s progress was too slow. The Government thought it \nwise or generous in these circumstances to release Gandhi on \nFebruary th. \n\nThe operation piqued Gandhi\u2019s curiosity, and when Manu \nGandhi, the granddaughter of his cousin, had to undergo an \n\n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nappendicectomy at Patna, in Bihar province, during a tour, the \nMahatma asked the surgeon, Dr. D. P. Bhargava, the same who \nwas first to reach Gandhi\u2019s side after the assassination, whether \nhe could be present. Dr. Bhargava assented on condition that \nGandhi wore a gauze mask, and two snapshots taken during the \noperation show Gandhi sitting on a chair, an unusual perch, with \na white mask covering the lower half of his face and tied around \nthe back of his head. Dr. Bhargava says Gandhi did not utter a \nword during the entire hour. (This was on May th, , at \n. p.m.) \n\n\u2018The West\u2019, Gandhi once wrote to Miss Slade, \u2018has always com\u00ac \nmanded my admiration for its surgical inventions and all-round \nprogress in that direction.\u2019 \n\nNevertheless, Gandhi never quite cast off his prejudices against \nphysicians. Once Gandhi resisted a penicillin injection. \n\n\u2018If I give you penicillin\u2019, the doctor said, \u2018you will recover in \nthree days. Otherwise it will take three weeks.\u2019 \n\n\u2018That\u2019s all right,\u2019 Gandhi replied. \u2018I\u2019m in no hurry.\u2019 \n\nThe doctor said he might infect others. \n\n\u2018Then give them penicillin\u2019, Gandhi advised. \n\nIn an unguarded moment, the same physician told Gandhi that \nif all sick people simply went to bed they\u2019d get well. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019t say that aloud,\u2019 Gandhi cautioned. \u2018You will lose all \nyour patients.\u2019 \n\nGandhi liked to be his own doctor. Mahadev Desai, who knew \nhim well, said, \u2018But for his fundamental objection to vivisection, \nhe might have been a physician and a surgeon.\u2019 Gandhi wrote a \nbook on health, and loved to recommend \u2018quack\u2019 remedies to \nfriends, callers and all of India. Accordingly, when he received \nhis unconditional discharge from Yeravda Jail and went to the \nbeach at Juhu, near Bombay, to recuperate in the home of \nShantikumar Morarjee, an industrialist, he decided that since \nhe would be doctoring himself he might as well doctor others too; \nhe converted the seaside villa into a temporary hospital where \nailing associates, summoned from near and far, gave Gandhi \npleasure by submitting to his mud packs, water baths, food fads \nand massage. Chiefly, however, he advanced his and their con\u00ac \nvalescence with the medicine of laughter and companionship. \n\nOthers came to Juhu too \u2014 unasked \u2014 and Gandhi appealed to \n\n \n\n\nOPERATION AND FAST \n\n\nthem through the press to come, if they must, between  and  in \nthe evening for prayers on the sands. But \u2018seeing me  , he explained, \n\u2018is not likely to be of benefit to you. It is an indication of your \nlove for me, but it is an exaggerated indication\u2019. It would be much \nbetter to spend the money and time on spinning. If they gave him \npeace he could husband his \u2018very small . . . capital of energy\u2019 and \nresume the active editorship of Young India , his \u2018viewspaper\u2019, and \nNavajivan , which he did on April rd, . \n\nTo Juhu, too, came G. R. Das and Motilal Nehru for discussions \non the ugly situation that had arisen during the twenty-two \nmonths Gandhi spent in prison. \n\nFirst, Hindu-Moslem friendship, the firm rock on which Gandhi \nhoped to build a united, free India, had been all but submerged \nin an angry tide of hostility between the two communities. The \nKhilafat movement was dead, killed not by Britain, but by Kemal \nPasha (Ataturk), the master of Moslem Turkey. Wiser than most \nof his Indian co-religionists, Kemal had created a secular republic, \nLatinized the cursive Arabic script, proscribed the fez and other \nOriental head-dress and, having deposed the Caliph, allowed him \nto flee to the island of Malta in a British man-of-war in November \n. A weak heir clung to the illusion of the Caliph\u2019s religious \nprimacy, but in March  he too became a refugee. \n\nLeft without a cause, the Khilafat movement disintegrated. \nTherewith, large-scale Hindu-Moslem political collaboration \ncame to an end. \n\nSecond, the non-co-operation movement was dead. \u2018Scores of \nlawyers have resumed practice,\u2019 Gandhi said, summarizing what \nhe was told at Juhu and what he learned first-hand. \u2018Some even \nregret having given it up . . . Hundreds of boys and girls who \ngave up government schools and colleges have repented of their \naction and returned to them.\u2019 Moreover, Motilal Nehru, C. R. \nDas and their many adherents favoured a return to the municipal, \nprovincial and national legislative councils. This, they main\u00ac \ntained, would enable them to participate in elections, keep in \ntouch with the people, air grievances in the deliberative assem\u00ac \nblies and obstruct the British government. Indeed, in some cases \nthe Government might lack a majority in the councils and be \nforced to rule by administrative fiat, thus unmasking the sham \nof dyarchy and showing the British nation that their imperialist \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nleaders were not ready to share power with Indians. This demon\u00ac \nstration might induce England to alter the system in India. \n\nTo carry out their programme, Das and the elder Nehru had, at \nthe end of , launched the Swaraj (Home-Rule) Party whose \n\u2018immediate\u2019 aim was Dominion Status within the Empire. \n\nThose who continued to uphold Gandhi\u2019s non-violent non-co- \noperation were called No-Changers. The two factions wanted \nSwaraj but had been fighting like bitter enemies. A compromise \ngiving them freedom of action kept both inside the Congress. \n\nConfronted with this picture at Juhu, Gandhi entered into the \nGandhi-Das Pact which confirmed the live-and-let-live arrange\u00ac \nment between the Gandhians and the Swaraj party. He did not \nwant to split Congress. \n\nGandhi was still a non-co-operator, still a champion of civil \ndisobedience and \u2018a strong disbeliever in this government\u2019, he \ndeclared in Young India of April th, . He would therefore \nhave pressed the boycott of the courts, schools and government \njobs and titles. But the Gandhians had grown discouraged during \nhis absence in jail. The boycott involved tremendous personal \nsacrifice which few could bear. The Swaraj party\u2019s policy, on the \nother hand, was alluring. It meant election victories, membership \nin legislatures, speech-making, etc. Gandhi had no short-range \nprogramme to match it. He accordingly withdrew from Indian \npolitics for several years and devoted himself to purifying India. \nSwaraj depended on how good India was, not how bad the British \nwere. \u2018My belief is that the instant India is purified India be\u00ac \ncomes free and not a moment earlier,\u2019 he wrote \u2018Charlie\u2019 Andrews. \n\nGandhi\u2019s purpose, during this period of withdrawal from \npolitics, was to foster the brotherhood of man among Indians. \nLooking around, it soon became obvious to him that \u2018the only \nquestion for immediate solution before the country is the Hindu- \nMoslem question. I agree with Mr. Jinnah,\u2019 he added, \u2018that \nHindu-Moslem unity means Swaraj . . . There is no question \nmore important and more pressing than this\u2019. \n\nGreat editor that he was, Gandhi dedicated the entire May th, \n, issue of Young India to his ooo-word article on \u2018Hindu- \nMoslem Tension, its Causes and Cure\u2019. After recording the Hindu \ncharges against Moslems (\u2018Mussulmans\u2019, he called them) and the \nMoslem countercharges and noting the growth of quarrels, \n\n \n\n\nOPERATION AND FAST \n\ndisputes and riots between the communities, he expressed the \nopinion that all this was \u2018a reaction against the spread of non\u00ac \nviolence. I feel the wave of violence coming. The Hindu-Moslem \ntension is an acute phase of this tiredness\u2019. \n\nWhat would cure this loss of faith in non-violence, Gandhi \nasked. Non-violence, he answered. \n\nGandhi\u2019s lengthy article was advocacy rather than analysis. \nHe believed in the immediate possibility of Hindu-Moslem \nfriendship \u2018because it is so natural, so necessary for both and \nbecause I believe in human nature\u2019. That is almost all of Gandhi \nin one sentence. \n\n\u2018The key to the situation lies with the Hindus,\u2019 he wrote. The \n\u2018two constant causes of friction\u2019 with the Moslems were cow- \nslaughter and music. \n\n\u2018Though I regard cow protection as the central fact of Hinduism \n[Gandhi declared], I have never been able to understand the \nantipathy towards the Mussulmans on that score. We say nothing \nabout the slaughter [of cows] that daily takes place on behalf of \nEnglishmen. Our anger becomes red-hot when a Mussulman \nslaughters a cow. All the riots that have taken place in the name \nof the cow have been an insane waste of effort. They have not \nsaved a single cow, but they have on the contrary stiffened the \nbacks of the Mussulmans and resulted in more slaughter. I am \nsatisfied that during  more cows were saved through the \nvoluntary and generous effort of the Mussulmans than through \nthe Hindu effort during all the previous twenty years, say. Cow \nprotection should commence with ourselves. In no part of the \nworld are cattle worse treated than in India . . . The half-starved \ncondition of the majority of our cattle are a disgrace to us. The \ncows find their necks under the butcher\u2019s knife because Hindus \nsell them. The only effective and honourable way is to befriend \nthe Mussulmans and leave it to their honour to save the cow. Cow \nprotection societies must turn their attention to the feeding of \ncattle, prevention of cruelty, preservation of the fast disappearing \npasture land, improving the breed of cattle. . . .\u2019 \n\nThen there was the music played in Hindu religious processions \nas they passed mosques at prayer time. Somehow, the processions \ncontrived to arrive in front of mosques just when the followers of \nthe Prophet were supplicating Allah. Gandhi had heard that \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nHindus sometimes did this \u2018with the deliberate intention of irri? \ntating Mussulmans\u2019. This was as wrong as the Moslem resort \nto violence in angry retaliation. \n\nGandhi\u2019s long article ignored the social-economic reasons for \nthe exacerbation of intercommunity relations except in one \nreference to the Moslem demand that a percentage of jobs in the \nGovernment be reserved for them. A Moslem middle class was \nbeginning to emerge in India (and throughout the Arab world); \nit found itself handicapped in competing with Hindus, Parsis and \nChristians who had the advantages of better education and \nbetter connections. The Moslems therefore wanted a certain \nnumber of jobs kept for them irrespective of their qualifications. \nGandhi objected. He said, \n\nTor administration to be efficient it must be in the hands of the \nfittest. There should certainly be no favouritism. If we want \nfive engineers we must not take one from each community but we \nmust take the fittest five even if they were all Mussulmans or all \nParsis . . . The educationally backward communities will have a \nright to favoured treatment in the matter of education at the \nhands of the national government. . . But those who aspire to \noccupy responsible posts in the government of the country can \nonly do so if they pass the required test.\u2019 \n\nThis was logical, fair and sensible, but completely unsatisfactory \nto the Moslems. And since the economic backwardness of India \nmade government employment one of the major, if not the major, \nindustries of the country, the reservation of official jobs for Moham\u00ac \nmedans remained a sore point as long as British rule lasted. \n\nIn the seven hundred thousand villages of India, Hindus and \nMoslems had always lived together in peace. The Hindu-Moslem \ntension of the twentieth century was a man-made, middle-class, \nurban disease. Indians are often ambitious and dynamic. A \ncity like Bombay throbs with vitality. The inhumanly crowded \ntowns, with their herring-barrel tenements and the frustration \nwhich comes from animal-like poverty and the very limited \nopportunities to earn, learn and advance, make urban Indians \neasily excitable \u2014 especially in the maddening heat of the long \nsummer. In cities, Gandhi\u2019s non-violence contended with nature \nas well as human nature. \n\nGandhi, the optimistic Karma yogi, regarded difficulties as \n\n \n\n\nOPERATION AND FAST \n\n\nspurs to greater exertions of will. The editor who gave an entire \nissue of his magazine to a problem was the doer who would give \nhis whole life to solve it. On September th, , therefore, \nGandhi started a twenty-one-day fast for Hindu-Moslem friendship. \n\nGandhi had been ill for months in jail. Then came the urgent \nappendicectomy. The wound suppurated and healed slowly. \nConvalescence was retarded. Weeks of tense talks followed by \nweeks of strenuous touring wore him out. The political situation \ndepressed him; years of work seemed to have been lost. At a \nconference of the All-India Congress Committee in June, when he \nrealized how many , of his associates really did not believe in non\u00ac \nviolence, he wept in public. The steady stream of reports on \nHindu-Moslem fighting and the atmosphere of bickering, hate and \ngloom weighed heavily on his body and spirit. He was fifty-five. \nHe knew that a twenty-one-day fast might be fatal. He did not \nwant to die. There were too many unfinished tasks. He revelled \nin life. Suicide was religiously and physically repugnant to him. \nThe fast was no tryst with death. It gave him no pleasure to \nsuffer. The fast was dictated by duty to the highest cause \u2014 the \nuniversal brotherhood of man. \n\nFor Gandhi, an act had to be right and true. Then he never \ncounted the cost to himself or even to others; in this sense, he was \nwithout mercy. Service meant sacrifice, renunciation and detach\u00ac \nment. You detach yourself from yourself. All that remains is \nduty. On September th, , Gandhi felt it his duty to fast. \n\nGandhi always kept his eye on his objective and when he could \nnot see it he kept his eye on the spot where he thought it would \nappear. He also had an eye for drama. He fasted in the home \nof a Moslem, Mohamed Ali, the younger brother of Shaukat. \nMohamed Ali was a staunch Congress supporter, a champion \nof Hindu-Moslem friendship. But the Moslem community was \nmoving away from him. Gandhi had said in his article that \u2018the \nkey to the situation lies with the Hindus\u2019, but with his heart, \nthe senior partner of his mind, he knew that Moslems were the \noffenders; conditions, he said, were making the Moslem \u2018a bully\u2019. \nGandhi wished to strengthen Mohamed Ali\u2019s hand. \u2018It is our \nduty\u2019, he once wrote, \u2018to strengthen by our fasting those who hold \nthe same ideals but are likely to weaken under pressure.\u2019 For \ntwenty-one days India\u2019s attention would be focused on the house \n\nq, m.g.  \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nwhere Gandhi lay fasting. Moslems would see that Mohandas \nand Mohamed were brothers. Hindus, moreover, would note \nthat their saint had confided his life to a Moslem. \n\nNo personal benefit could come to Gandhi from the fast; on \nthe contrary. Nor was there any element of compulsion in it. \nThe Moslem in Calcutta or Agra, the Hindu in Amritsar or \nAllahabad would not be compelled to change their conduct be\u00ac \ncause Gandhi was dying for Hindu-Moslem amity. They would \nchange, if at all, because the Mahatma\u2019s great sacrifice established \na spiritual bond between him and them, a kind of common wave\u00ac \nlength, a means of communication over which he conveyed to \nthem the importance, the necessity, the urgency, the sacredness \nof the cause for which he was fasting. It was his way of going out \nto them, of entering their hearts, of uniting himself with them. \n\nIn part, this is Eastern, Indian. The bridges of the West are \nmade of concrete, steel, wire, words. Eastern bridges are of spirit. \nTo communicate, the West moves or talks. The East sits, con\u00ac \ntemplates, suffers. Gandhi partook of West and East. When \nWestern methods failed him, he used Eastern methods. \n\nThe fast was an adventure in goodness. The stake was one man\u2019s \nlife. The prize was a nation\u2019s freedom. If Indians were united as \nbrothers, no outsider could long be their master. The British \nofficial report on conditions in India in  remarked, \u00a3 One \nnoticeable feature of the general excitement was the unpre\u00ac \ncedented fraternization between the Hindus and the Moham\u00ac \nmedans.\u2019 In , Gandhi felt that the fraternization, and with it \nfreedom, was ebbing away. Hence the ordeal under his Moslem \nbrother\u2019s roof. \n\n\u2018Nothing evidently which I say or write can bring the two \ncommunities together,\u2019 he declared in announcing the fast. T am \ntherefore imposing on myself a twenty-one-day fast from today \nand ending Wednesday October th. I reserve the liberty to \ndrink water with or without salt. It is both a penance and a \nprayer ... I respectfully invite the heads of all communities, \nincluding Englishmen, to meet and end this quarrel which is a \ndisgrace to religion and to humanity. It seems as if God has been \ndethroned. Let us reinstate Him in our hearts.\u2019 \n\nTwo Moslem physicians were in constant attendance. Charles \nFreer Andrews, the Christian missionary, served as nurse. \n\n \n\n\nOPERATION AND FAST \n\n\nOn the second day of the fast, Gandhi wrote a page-long plea \nfor Young India on \u2018unity in diversity  . \u2018The need of the moment  , \nhe stressed, \u2018is not one religion but mutual respect and tolerance \nof the devotees of the different religions.  On the sixth day with\u00ac \nout food he wrote a page article which ended, \u2018To paraphrase a \nBiblical verse, if it is no profanation, \u201cSeek you first Hindu-Moslem \nunity, removal of untouchability and the spinning wheel and \nKhaddar [homespun] and everything will be added unto you  .  \n\nTwelve days after the fast commenced he wrote  words for \npublication: \u2018Hitherto it has been a struggle and a yearning for a \nchange of heart among Englishmen who compose the government \nof India. That change has still to come. But the struggle must for \nthe moment be transferred to a change of heart among the Hindus \nand the Mussulmans. Before they dare think of freedom they \nmust be brave enough to love one another, to tolerate one an\u00ac \nother\u2019s religion, even prejudices and superstitions, and to trust \none another. This requires faith in oneself. And faith in oneself \nis faith in God. If we have that faith we shall cease to fear one \nanother.  \n\nThe twentieth day he dictated a prayer: \u2018Presently from the \nworld of peace I shall enter the world of strife. The more I think \nof it the more helpless I feel ... I know that I can do nothing. \nGod can do everything. O! God, make me Thy instrument and \nuse me as Thou wilt. Man is nothing. Napoleon planned much \nand found himself a prisoner in St. Helena. The mighty Kaiser \naimed at the crown of Europe and is reduced to the status of a \nprivate gentleman. God has so willed it. Let us contemplate \nsuch examples and be humble.  The twenty days had been \u2018days \nof grace, privilege and peace  . \n\nThat evening \u2018Mahatma Gandhi was wonderfully bright and \ncheerful,  Andrews wrote. \u2018Many of his most intimate friends \ncame to see him as he lay upon his bed on the open roof of the \nhouse, which was flooded by the moonlight.  They prayed. \n\u2018Then followed a long silence. The friends parted one by one and \nhe was left alone.  \n\nThe twenty-first day: \u2018Before four o\u2019clock in the morning . . . \nwe were called for the morning prayers,  Andrews recorded. \n\u2018There was no moon and it was very dark. A chili breeze was \nblowing from the east . . . Bapu was wrapped warmly in a dark \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nshawl and I asked him whether he had slept well. He replied, \n\u201cYes, very well indeed.\u201d It was a happiness to notice at once \nthat his voice was stronger than the morning before, instead of \nweaker.\u2019 After prayers, many people came for darshan, a sight \nthat blesses. \n\nAt about io a.m. (Andrews writes), Mahatmaji called for me \nand said, \u2018Can you remember the words of my favourite Christian \nhymn?\u2019 \n\nI sajd, \u2018Yes, shall I sing it to you now?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Not now,\u2019 he answered, \u2018but I have in mind that when I \nbreak my fast, we might have a little ceremony expressing religious \nunity. I should like the Imam Sahib to recite the opening verses \nof the Koran. Then I would like you to sing the Christian hymn, \nyou know the one I mean, it begins, \u201cWhen I survey the wondrous \nCross\u201d and ends with the words, \n\nLove so amazing, so divine, \n\nDemands my soul, my life, my all. \n\nAnd then last of all I should like Vinoba to recite from the \nUpanishads and Balkrishna to sing the Vaishnava hymn . . .\u2019 He \nwanted all the servants present. \n\nNow at last the midday hour had come and the fast was to be \nbroken. \n\nThe doctors went to Gandhi\u2019s room; the Ali brothers, Maulana \nAbu! Kalam Azad, Motilal Nehru, C. R. Das and many others \nsat on the floor near the bed. Before the actual breaking of the \nfast, Gandhi spoke, \u2018and as he spoke his emotion was so deep that \nin his bodily weakness his voice could hardly be heard except by \nthose who were nearest of all to him\u2019. He asked them to lay down \ntheir lives, if need be, for the cause of brotherhood. The Moslem \nleaders renewed their pledge. Then the hymns were sung. \u2018Dr. \nAnsari brought forward some orange juice and Mahatma Gandhi \ndrank it. So the fast was broken.\u2019 \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER XIII \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT\u2019 YEAR \n\nI n the silent year there were fifty-two silent Mondays when \nGandhi did not speak. On those days, he would listen to an \ninterviewer and occasionally tear off a corner of a piece of \npaper and pencil a few words in reply. Since this was not the best \nway to conduct a conversation, the weekly day of silence gave him \nsome privacy. \n\nIn , I inquired of Gandhi what lay behind his day of \nsilence. \n\n\u2018It happened when I was being torn to pieces,\u2019 he explained. \n\u2018I was working very hard, travelling in hot trains, incessantly \nspeaking at many meetings and being approached in trains and \nelsewhere by thousands of people who asked questions, made \npleas and wished to pray with me. I wanted to rest for one day a \nweek. So I instituted the day of silence. Later of course I clothed \nit with all kinds of virtues and gave it a spiritual cloak. But the \nmotivation was really nothing more than that I wanted to have \na day off.\u2019 \n\nHe liked to laugh at himself. Questioned further, he would have \nagreed, however, that silence offered an opportunity for spiritual \nexercise. \n\nApart from the fifty-two Mondays, the \u2018silent\u2019 year was in no \nsense silent. He did not travel, he addressed no mass meetings; \nbut he talked, wrote, received visitors and maintained a corres\u00ac \npondence with thousands of persons in India and other countries. \n\nOn April st, , Lord Irwin (who later became Lord \nHalifax, Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom and British \nAmbassador to Washington) arrived in India to succeed Lord \nReading as Viceroy. But the fateful change was not mentioned in \nYoung India , nor did Gandhi seem to have noted it in any other \nway. He was still a non-co-operator working on the masses instead \nof on the Viceroy. His motto was Swaraj from within. \n\nOne extremely important change, however, was noticeable in \nGandhi\u2019s attitude: he began to suspect that Britain\u2019s policy \n\n \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT\u2019 YEAR \n\n\nmilitated against Hindu-Moslem friendship. \u2018The government of \nIndia\u2019, he wrote on August th, , \u2018is based on distrust. Dis\u00ac \ntrust involves favouritism and favouritism must breed division.  \nThe Government appeared to prefer Moslems. \n\nGandhi had thought that Hindu-Moslem amity would bring \nself-rule to India. Now he felt that Hindu-Moslem amity was \nalmost impossible while the British, \u2018the third party  , were there. \n\nThus religious peace, the pre-requisite of independence, could \nonly follow independence. \n\nThis dilemma notwithstanding, Gandhi remained hopeful: \n\u2018The unity will come in spite of ourselves . . . Where man\u2019s effort \nmay fail God\u2019s will succeed and His government is not based \nupon \u201cdivide and rule\u201d policy.  Meanwhile, there had been \nbloody fighting between the two religious communities in several \nparts of India. \n\nGandhi\u2019s prescription was better treatment, of the Moslem \nminority by the Hindu majority and non-violence by both. \nHindus violently accused him of being pro-Moslem. \n\nBut the year\u2019s fiercest controversy involved dogs. For months, \nthe storm raged about the Mahatma\u2019s head. \n\nAmbalal Sarabhai, the big textile millowner of Ahmedabad, \nrounded up sixty stray dogs that frequented his large industrial \nproperties and had them destroyed. \n\nHaving destroyed the dogs, Sarabhai was disturbed and shared \nhis anguish with the Mahatma. \u2018What else could be done?\u2019 said \nGandhi. \n\nThe Ahmedabad Humanitarian Society learned of this conver\u00ac \nsation and turned on Gandhi. \u2018Is that true?\u2019 it demanded in a \nletter sent to the ashram. Did he say, \u2018What else could be done? \n\n. . . And if so, what does it mean? ... \n\n\u2018When Hinduism forbids the taking of the life of any living \nbeing,\u2019 the letter fumed, \u2018when it declares it to be a sin, do you \nthink it right to kill rabid dogs for the reason that they would \nbite human beings and by biting other dogs make them also rabid?\u2019 \n\nGandhi published the letter in Young India under the caption \u2018Is \nThis Humanity?\u2019 The letter and his reply filled the entire first \npage and half the second page. Yes, it was true. He had said, \n\u2018What else could be done?\u2019 and having thought it over, \u2018I . . . feel \nthat my reply was quite proper. . . . \n\n\nR \n\n\n \n\n\nM.G. \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\n\u2018Imperfect, erring mortals as we are/ he declared in explana\u00ac \ntion, \u2018there is no course open to us but the destruction of rabid \ndogs. At times we may be faced with the unavoidable duty of \nkilling a man who is found in the act of killing people.  \n\nThe next issue of Young India gave its front page to the same \nquestion under the same caption, \u2018Is This Humanity?  The first \narticle had brought a deluge of \u2018angry letters  . Worse, people \ncame to Gandhi to insult him. \u2018At an hour  , he wrote, \u2018when \nafter a hard day\u2019s work I was about to retire to bed, three friends \ninvaded me, infringed the religion of non-violence in the name of \nhumanity and engaged me in a discussion on it.  Gandhi used the \nword \u2018friends\u2019 only because he considered everybody a friend. \nOne of the \u2018friends\u2019 was a Jain and he \u2018betrayed anger, bitterness \nand arrogance  . \n\nGandhi had grown up under the influence of the absolute non\u00ac \nviolence of Jainism. \u2018Many take me to be a Jain,  Gandhi \ndeclared. But Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, \u2018was an incarna\u00ac \ntion of compassion, of non-violence. How I wish his votaries were \nvotaries also of non-violence  . \n\nGandhi stuck to his guns. \u2018The multiplication of dogs is  , he \nwrote, \u2018unnecessary. A roving dog without an owner is a danger \nto society and a swarm of them is a menace to its very existence.  \nIf people were really religious, dogs would have owners. \u2018There \nis a regular science of dog-keeping in the West. . . We should \nlearn it.  \n\nThe dog mail continued to come; \u2018some of the hostile critics \nhave transgressed the limits of deco'rum  , Gandhi asserted in the \nnext Young India which devoted almost three pages to the matter. \nOne man had demanded an interview and then, without permis\u00ac \nsion, published the substance of it in a leaflet which he was \nhawking in the streets. \u2018Does he seek to teach me in this manner?  \nGandhi wondered. He who is angry is guilty of violence. How \ncan such a man teach me non-violence? \n\n\u2018Even so,  Gandhi continued, \u2018the hostile critics are doing me a \nservice. They teach me to examine myself. They afford me an \nopportunity to see if I am free from the reaction of anger. And \nwhen I go to the root of their anger I find nothing but love.  How \ndid he arrive at that strange conclusion? Because, he said, \u2018They \nhad attributed to me non-violence as they understand it. Now \n\n \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT  YEAR \n\n\nthey find me acting in a contrary manner and are angry with me. \n\n' T do not mind their outburst of anger,  he asserted I appreciate \nthe motive behind it. I must try to reason with them patiently... \n\nHe reasoned thus: It is a sin to feed stray dogs. \u2018It is a false \nsense of compassion. It is an insult to a starving dog to throw a \ncrumb at him. Roving dogs do not indicate the civilization or \ncompassion of the society, they betray on the contrary the ignor\u00ac \nance and lethargy of its members. The lower animals are our \nbrethren. I include among them the lion and the tiger. We do \nnot know how to live with these carnivorous beasts and poisonous \nreptiles because of our ignorance. When man learns better he \nwill learn to befriend even these. Today he does not even know \nhow to befriend a man of a different religion or from a different \ncountry.  \n\nGandhi probably suspected that some of the dog-lovers would \nhowl less if sixty Moslems or Englishmen had been killed. \n\nThe humane man, Gandhi wrote, would finance a society to \nkeep the stray dogs; or he would harbour some himself. But if the \nState did not care for them and if householders would not keep \nthem, the dogs had to be destroyed. \u2018The dogs in India  , Gandhi \nmourned, \u2018are today in as bad a plight as the decrepit animals \nand men in the land.  \n\n(Then why not kill the decrepit cows?) \n\n\u2018Taking life may be a duty,  Gandhi proceeded. \u2018Suppose a \nman runs amok and goes furiously about, sword in hand and \nkilling any one who comes his way and no one dares to capture \nhim alive. Any one who dispatched this lunatiq will earn the \ngratitude of the community. . . .\u2019 \n\nMany correspondents demanded personal replies and threat\u00ac \nened to attack him if they got none. He said he could not answer \nthe mountain of letters that had reached him on this subject, but \nhe would continue to deal with them in his magazines. Four \nmore issues of Young India gave several columns each to the dog \nproblem. In one Ahmedabad hospital, Gandhi reported,  \ncases of hydrophobia had been treated in  and  in . \nAgain he urged India to follow the West in this matter; \u2018If any \none thinks that the people in the West are innocent of humanity he \nis sadly mistaken.  And then comes a sting: \u2018The ideal of humanity \nm the West is perhaps lower, but their practice of it is very much \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nmore thorough than ours. We rest content with a lofty ideal and \nare slow or lazy in its practice. We are wrapped in deep darkness, \nas is evident from our paupers, cattle and other animals. They are \neloquent of our irreligion rather than of religion.\u2019 \n\nHis pro-dog attitude showed he was under Western influence, \ncorrespondents charged. Patiently he reasoned with the furious. \nHe condemned some features of Western civilization and had \nlearned from others, he told them. Moreover, opinions should be \njudged by content not by their source. \n\n\u2018Letters on this subject are still pouring in,\u2019 Gandhi announced \nin the third month of the controversy, but since their only con\u00ac \ntribution was venom he ignored them. \n\nThe dog fight established the record for heat in the \u2018silent year\u2019. \nBut a little calf also precipitated a storm. A young heifer in the \nashram fell ill. Gandhi tended it and watched it suffer and decided \nit ought to be put to death. Kasturbai objected strenuously. \nThen she must go and nurse the animal, Gandhi suggested. She \ndid and the animal\u2019s torment convinced her. In Gandhi\u2019s \npresence, a doctor administered an injection which killed the \nheifer. The protest mail was heavy and fierce. Gandhi insisted \nhe had done right. \n\nFrank sex discussions filled many Letters to the Editor. \u2018My \ncorrespondence with young men on their private conduct\u2019, \nGandhi wrote, \u2018is increasing.\u2019 They asked his advice. \n\nTaking advantage of relative leisure in the \u2018silent year\u2019, Gandhi \nread Havelock Ellis, Forel, Paul Bureau\u2019s Toward Moral Bank\u00ac \nruptcy and other European authorities on family and sex. His \ninterest in the sex life of Indians always remained high. He \nbelieved that early and frequent sexual intercourse had a debilitat\u00ac \ning effect on Indians; he understood the implications of the rapid \nincrease in his country\u2019s population. (In the s, the popula\u00ac \ntion of India was increasing five million each year.) He wrapped \nthis problem too in a spiritual cloak and, taking a leaf out of \nsacred Hindu books, advocated chastity for religious reasons. \nBut the biological and economic aspects of the situation did not \nescape him. \n\nIn many articles that came from his pen, or pencil, in \u2018silent\u2019 \n and often thereafter, Gandhi consistently opposed the use of \ncontraceptives; they were a Western vice. But he did not oppose \n\n \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT\u2019 YEAR \n\n\nbirth control. He always advocated birth control. The birth \ncontrol he favoured, however, was through self-control, through \nthe power of the mind over the body. \u2018Self-control\u2019, he wrote, \u2018is \nthe surest and only method of regulating the birth rate.\u2019 Without \nsuch discipline, he contended, man was no better than a brute. \nHe maintained that abstinence for ever or for long periods was \nneither physically nor psychologically harmful. Gandhi and his \nclosest ashram associates practised Brahmacharya, complete \ncontinence; people in general, he said, might indulge in sex for \npurposes of procreation, but not to gratify animal passion. He \ndenied \u2018that sexual indulgence for its own sake is a human \nnecessity\u2019. \n\nA correspondent wrote: \u2018In my case, three weeks seem to be the \nutmost period of beneficial abstention. At the end of that period I \nusually feel a heaviness of body, a restlessness both of body and \nmind, leading to bad temper. Relief is obtained either by normal \ncoitus or nature herself coming to the rescue by an involuntary \ndischarge. Far from feeling weak or nervous, I become the next \nmorning calm and light and am able to proceed to my work \nwith added gusto.\u2019 Many similar cases were brought to Gandhi\u2019s \nnotice. \n\nDipping into his personal experience, Gandhi said in reply, \n\u2018Ability to retain and assimilate the vital liquid is a matter of \nlong training.\u2019 Once achieved, it strengthens body and mind. \nThe vital liquid, \u2018capable of producing such a wonderful being as \nman, cannot but, when properly conserved, be transmuted into \nmatchless energy and strength\u2019. \n\nRealistically, in Harijan magazine of September th, , \nGandhi wrote, \u2018Assuming that birth control by artificial aids is \njustifiable under certain conditions, it seems to be utterly im\u00ac \npracticable of application among the millions.\u2019 India was poor \nand ignorant because she was too poor and ignorant to apply \nbirth control by contraceptives. Therefore, Gandhi urged other \nmeans of reducing the population. Contraceptives led to over- \nindulgence with the result that a \u2018society that has already become \nenervated through a variety of causes will become still further \nenervated by the adoption of artificial methods\u2019. \n\nGandhi endeavoured to delay the marriage of his own sons. \nTimes without number, he attacked the institution of child marri- \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nage: \u2018Early marriages are a fruitful source of life, adding to the \npopulation . . He conceded, of course, that the earth should \nproduce enough to support all who are born on it, but, as a reli\u00ac \ngious man with a strong practical sense, he saw the necessity of \npopulation limitation. \u2018If\u2019, he wrote to Charles Freer Andrews, \n\u2018I could find a way of stopping procreation in a civil and voluntary \nmanner whilst India remains in the present miserable state I \nwould do so today.\u2019 The only manner he countenanced was \nmental discipline. To the strong and saintly he proposed lifelong \nBramacharya; to the mass, he proposed late marriage, in the mid\u00ac \ntwenties if possible and self-control thereafter. In the ashram, the \nminimum marriage age for girls was twenty-one. He recognized \nhuman frailties but insisted that unspiced food, the right kind of \nclothes, the right kind of work, walking, gymnastics, unspiced \nliterature, prayer, pure films (Indian films to this day prohibit \nkissing on the screen) and devotion to God would relieve the \ntension in modern life and conduce to the sexual self-control \nwhich most persons unthinkingly consider unnatural. Gandhi\u2019s \nwritings on these matters, though they appeared in his small- \ncirculation Young India and Gujarat Navajivan , were, like almost \neverything he said, reprinted in the entire Indian press. \n\nA cognate question attracted Gandhi\u2019s special attention during \nthe \u2018silent\u2019 year: child widows. According to the official British \ncensus for , which he cited, there were in India , \nwidows less than five years old; , widows between the ages \nof five and ten; and , widows between ten and fifteen; \ntogether , widows under sixteen. \n\n\u2018The existence of girl widows\u2019, Gandhi exclaimed, \u2018is a blot \nupon Hinduism.\u2019 Parents would marry their baby daughters to \nbaby sons of other families, or even to old men and if the husband \ndied, either in infancy or of senility, the widow could not, under \nHindu law, remarry. Defiantly, Gandhi declared, \u2018I consider \nremarriage of virgin widows not only desirable but the bounden \nduty of all parents who happen to have such widowed daughters.\u2019 \nSome of these youthful widows were no longer virgins but pros\u00ac \ntitutes. \u2018The remedy in anticipation,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018is to prevent early \nmarriages.\u2019 To those bigoted Hindus who, loyal to every immoral \ncustom, defended the proscription against second marriage of \nchild widows, Gandhi retorted, \u2018They were never married at alt.\u2019 \n\n \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT\u2019 YEAR \n\n\nThe wedding of a child is a sacrilege, not a sacred rite. His deepest \nfeeling about child widows was expressed in one sweet sentence, \n\u2018They are strangers to love.\u2019 Chastity had to be the deliberate and \nvoluntary act of a mature person, not the imposition of cruel \nparents on children. Gandhi wanted all human beings to know \nlove. But a widow, or widower, who had married as an adult \nshould not remarry, he said; they had tasted love. This proscrip\u00ac \ntion constituted another birth-control technique. \n\nProtection of the cow, protection of Indians in South Africa \nwhere race hate was again rampant, prohibition and world peace \nalso excited Gandhi\u2019s reforming zeal during his Sabbatical year. \n\nOccasionally, some proverbs dropped from his pen: \u2018Any \nsecrecy hinders the real spirit of democracy\u2019; \u2018If we could erase \nthe \u201cFs\u201d and \u201cMine\u2019s\u201d from religion, politics, economics, etc., \nwe should be free and bring heaven on earth.\u2019 Occasionally, too, \nhe made brief excursions into religion, but there was remarkably \nlittle discussion in print about God, metaphysics and kindred \ntopics. One thought he did leave with his readers: \u2018Rationalists \nare admirable beings,\u2019 he wrote in an article on the efficacy of \nprayer; \u2018rationalism is a hideous monster when it claims for itself \nomnipotence. Attribution of omnipotence to reason is as bad a \npiece of idolatry as is worship of stick and stone believing it to \nbe God ... I do not know a single rationalist who has never done \nanything in simple faith . . . But we all know millions of human \nbeings living their more or less orderly lives because of their child\u00ac \nlike faith in the Maker of us all. That very faith is a prayer ... I \nplead not for the suppression of reason, but for due recognition \nof that in us which sanctions reason itself.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Mankind cannot live by logic alone, but also needs poetry,\u2019 he \nonce wrote. Gandhi frequently left the field of sensory perception \nand rational mental processes for that middle zone of faith, in\u00ac \nstinct, intuition and love, but he never wandered away from it \ninto the rarefied realm of mystic messages, miracles, hallucinations, \nprophecy and other unaccountable manifestations of mind and \nbody. \u2018Whilst he did not rule out the authenticity of supra- \nsensuous phenomena,\u2019 says one of his closest disciples, \u2018he very \nstrongly disapproved of pursuing them.\u2019 He judged men and \nevents by the criteria of cold facts and invited others to judge him \nrationally. He did not wish to influence people by mystic radia- \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\ntion. His estimate of himself was severely sober. His work was \npractical and its goal was practical success. He told Muriel Lester, \nan Englishwoman, that he \u2018never heard a voice, saw a vision, or \nhad some recognized experience of God\u2019. No mystic experience \nhad been vouchsafed to him. His guide was reason on the wing \nof faith. \n\nGandhi\u2019s reputation abroad was spreading. Romain Rolland, \nthe French author, wrote a book about him. Many invitations \nreached him, especially from America, to come on a visit. He \nrejected them. \u2018My reason is simple,\u2019 he explained, \u2018I have not \nenough self-confidence to warrant my going to America. I have \nno doubt that the movement for non-violence has come to stay. \nI have no doubt whatsoever about its final success. But I cannot \ngive an ocular demonstration of the efficacy of non-violence. \nTill then, I feel I must continue to preach from the narrower \nIndian platform.\u2019 \n\nTwo American women, Mrs. Kelly and Mrs. Langeloth, re\u00ac \npresenting the Fellowship of Faith, the League of Neighbours and \nthe Union of East and West, actually came to Sabarmati to \ninvite the Mahatma. First they cross-examined him: \u2018Is it true \nthat you object to railways, steamships and other means of speedy \nlocomotion?\u2019 \n\n\u2018It is and it is not,\u2019 Gandhi replied patiently, for the thousandth \ntime, and urged them to read his Indian Home-Rule. More conversa\u00ac \ntion of the same kind followed. He was afraid, in the end, that \nthey did not understand his attitude to the machine and speed, \nbecause they had to catch a train and left early. \n\nGandhi was in no hurry either personally or politically, and sat \nstill for a year. He seemed to enjoy his  moratorium from \npolitics. It gave his body time to rest and his spirit a chance to \nroam. He played more with the children. He participated in an \nashram spinning contest. He and Kasturbai, the oldest members \nof the community, were beaten by the youngest, their grand\u00ac \ndaughter. The announcement evoked great hilarity. \n\nHe cultivated his friends, Rajagopalachari, the lawyer with the \nrazor-edge brain; Mahadev Desai, who was a secretary and an \napostle; and \u2018Charlie\u2019 Andrews, two years Gandhi\u2019s junior, whom \nGandhi called \u2018The Good Samaritan\u2019. He \u2018is more than a blood \nbrother to me\u2019, Gandhi said. \u2018I do not think that I can claim a \n\n \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT\u2019 YEAR \n\ndeeper attachment to anyone than to Mr. Andrews.\u2019 The Hindu \nsaint had found no better saint than Andrews. The Christian \nmissionary had found no better Christian than Gandhi. Perhaps \nthe Indian and Englishman were brothers because they were truly \nreligious. Perhaps religion brought them together because \nnationality did not separate them. \u2018Each country\u2019, Andrews said, \nspeaking of England and India, \u2018has become equally dear to me.\u2019 \nGandhi declared, \u2018I would not hurt England or Germany to serve \nIndia.\u2019 In a letter to Andrews dated Calcutta, December th, \n, Gandhi wrote, \u2018The most forward nationalists in India have \nnot been haters of the West or of England or in any other way \nnarrow . . . but they have been internationalists under the guise \nof nationalism.\u2019 \n\nWhere nationalism does not divide, religion can make men \nbrothers. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER XIII \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT\u2019 YEAR \n\nI n the silent year there were fifty-two silent Mondays when \nGandhi did not speak. On those days, he would listen to an \ninterviewer and occasionally tear off a corner of a piece of \npaper and pencil a few words in reply. Since this was not the best \nway to conduct a conversation, the weekly day of silence gave him \nsome privacy. \n\nIn , I inquired of Gandhi what lay behind his day of \nsilence. \n\n\u2018It happened when I was being torn to pieces,\u2019 he explained. \n\u2018I was working very hard, travelling in hot trains, incessantly \nspeaking at many meetings and being approached in trains and \nelsewhere by thousands of people who asked questions, made \npleas and wished to pray with me. I wanted to rest for one day a \nweek. So I instituted the day of silence. Later of course I clothed \nit with all kinds of virtues and gave it a spiritual cloak. But the \nmotivation was really nothing more than that I wanted to have \na day off.\u2019 \n\nHe liked to laugh at himself. Questioned further, he would have \nagreed, however, that silence offered an opportunity for spiritual \nexercise. \n\nApart from the fifty-two Mondays, the \u2018silent\u2019 year was in no \nsense silent. He did not travel, he addressed no mass meetings; \nbut he talked, wrote, received visitors and maintained a corres\u00ac \npondence with thousands of persons in India and other countries. \n\nOn April st, , Lord Irwin (who later became Lord \nHalifax, Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom and British \nAmbassador to Washington) arrived in India to succeed Lord \nReading as Viceroy. But the fateful change was not mentioned in \nYoung India , nor did Gandhi seem to have noted it in any other \nway. He was still a non-co-operator working on the masses instead \nof on the Viceroy. His motto was Swaraj from within. \n\nOne extremely important change, however, was noticeable in \nGandhi\u2019s attitude: he began to suspect that Britain\u2019s policy \n\n \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT\u2019 YEAR \n\n\nmilitated against Hindu-Moslem friendship. \u2018The government of \nIndia\u2019, he wrote on August th, , \u2018is based on distrust. Dis\u00ac \ntrust involves favouritism and favouritism must breed division.  \nThe Government appeared to prefer Moslems. \n\nGandhi had thought that Hindu-Moslem amity would bring \nself-rule to India. Now he felt that Hindu-Moslem amity was \nalmost impossible while the British, \u2018the third party  , were there. \n\nThus religious peace, the pre-requisite of independence, could \nonly follow independence. \n\nThis dilemma notwithstanding, Gandhi remained hopeful: \n\u2018The unity will come in spite of ourselves . . . Where man\u2019s effort \nmay fail God\u2019s will succeed and His government is not based \nupon \u201cdivide and rule\u201d policy.  Meanwhile, there had been \nbloody fighting between the two religious communities in several \nparts of India. \n\nGandhi\u2019s prescription was better treatment, of the Moslem \nminority by the Hindu majority and non-violence by both. \nHindus violently accused him of being pro-Moslem. \n\nBut the year\u2019s fiercest controversy involved dogs. For months, \nthe storm raged about the Mahatma\u2019s head. \n\nAmbalal Sarabhai, the big textile millowner of Ahmedabad, \nrounded up sixty stray dogs that frequented his large industrial \nproperties and had them destroyed. \n\nHaving destroyed the dogs, Sarabhai was disturbed and shared \nhis anguish with the Mahatma. \u2018What else could be done?\u2019 said \nGandhi. \n\nThe Ahmedabad Humanitarian Society learned of this conver\u00ac \nsation and turned on Gandhi. \u2018Is that true?\u2019 it demanded in a \nletter sent to the ashram. Did he say, \u2018What else could be done? \n\n. . . And if so, what does it mean? ... \n\n\u2018When Hinduism forbids the taking of the life of any living \nbeing,\u2019 the letter fumed, \u2018when it declares it to be a sin, do you \nthink it right to kill rabid dogs for the reason that they would \nbite human beings and by biting other dogs make them also rabid?\u2019 \n\nGandhi published the letter in Young India under the caption \u2018Is \nThis Humanity?\u2019 The letter and his reply filled the entire first \npage and half the second page. Yes, it was true. He had said, \n\u2018What else could be done?\u2019 and having thought it over, \u2018I . . . feel \nthat my reply was quite proper. . . . \n\n\nR \n\n\n \n\n\nM.G. \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\n\u2018Imperfect, erring mortals as we are/ he declared in explana\u00ac \ntion, \u2018there is no course open to us but the destruction of rabid \ndogs. At times we may be faced with the unavoidable duty of \nkilling a man who is found in the act of killing people.  \n\nThe next issue of Young India gave its front page to the same \nquestion under the same caption, \u2018Is This Humanity?  The first \narticle had brought a deluge of \u2018angry letters  . Worse, people \ncame to Gandhi to insult him. \u2018At an hour  , he wrote, \u2018when \nafter a hard day\u2019s work I was about to retire to bed, three friends \ninvaded me, infringed the religion of non-violence in the name of \nhumanity and engaged me in a discussion on it.  Gandhi used the \nword \u2018friends\u2019 only because he considered everybody a friend. \nOne of the \u2018friends\u2019 was a Jain and he \u2018betrayed anger, bitterness \nand arrogance  . \n\nGandhi had grown up under the influence of the absolute non\u00ac \nviolence of Jainism. \u2018Many take me to be a Jain,  Gandhi \ndeclared. But Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, \u2018was an incarna\u00ac \ntion of compassion, of non-violence. How I wish his votaries were \nvotaries also of non-violence  . \n\nGandhi stuck to his guns. \u2018The multiplication of dogs is  , he \nwrote, \u2018unnecessary. A roving dog without an owner is a danger \nto society and a swarm of them is a menace to its very existence.  \nIf people were really religious, dogs would have owners. \u2018There \nis a regular science of dog-keeping in the West. . . We should \nlearn it.  \n\nThe dog mail continued to come; \u2018some of the hostile critics \nhave transgressed the limits of deco'rum  , Gandhi asserted in the \nnext Young India which devoted almost three pages to the matter. \nOne man had demanded an interview and then, without permis\u00ac \nsion, published the substance of it in a leaflet which he was \nhawking in the streets. \u2018Does he seek to teach me in this manner?  \nGandhi wondered. He who is angry is guilty of violence. How \ncan such a man teach me non-violence? \n\n\u2018Even so,  Gandhi continued, \u2018the hostile critics are doing me a \nservice. They teach me to examine myself. They afford me an \nopportunity to see if I am free from the reaction of anger. And \nwhen I go to the root of their anger I find nothing but love.  How \ndid he arrive at that strange conclusion? Because, he said, \u2018They \nhad attributed to me non-violence as they understand it. Now \n\n \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT  YEAR \n\n\nthey find me acting in a contrary manner and are angry with me. \n\n' T do not mind their outburst of anger,  he asserted I appreciate \nthe motive behind it. I must try to reason with them patiently... \n\nHe reasoned thus: It is a sin to feed stray dogs. \u2018It is a false \nsense of compassion. It is an insult to a starving dog to throw a \ncrumb at him. Roving dogs do not indicate the civilization or \ncompassion of the society, they betray on the contrary the ignor\u00ac \nance and lethargy of its members. The lower animals are our \nbrethren. I include among them the lion and the tiger. We do \nnot know how to live with these carnivorous beasts and poisonous \nreptiles because of our ignorance. When man learns better he \nwill learn to befriend even these. Today he does not even know \nhow to befriend a man of a different religion or from a different \ncountry.  \n\nGandhi probably suspected that some of the dog-lovers would \nhowl less if sixty Moslems or Englishmen had been killed. \n\nThe humane man, Gandhi wrote, would finance a society to \nkeep the stray dogs; or he would harbour some himself. But if the \nState did not care for them and if householders would not keep \nthem, the dogs had to be destroyed. \u2018The dogs in India  , Gandhi \nmourned, \u2018are today in as bad a plight as the decrepit animals \nand men in the land.  \n\n(Then why not kill the decrepit cows?) \n\n\u2018Taking life may be a duty,  Gandhi proceeded. \u2018Suppose a \nman runs amok and goes furiously about, sword in hand and \nkilling any one who comes his way and no one dares to capture \nhim alive. Any one who dispatched this lunatiq will earn the \ngratitude of the community. . . .\u2019 \n\nMany correspondents demanded personal replies and threat\u00ac \nened to attack him if they got none. He said he could not answer \nthe mountain of letters that had reached him on this subject, but \nhe would continue to deal with them in his magazines. Four \nmore issues of Young India gave several columns each to the dog \nproblem. In one Ahmedabad hospital, Gandhi reported,  \ncases of hydrophobia had been treated in  and  in . \nAgain he urged India to follow the West in this matter; \u2018If any \none thinks that the people in the West are innocent of humanity he \nis sadly mistaken.  And then comes a sting: \u2018The ideal of humanity \nm the West is perhaps lower, but their practice of it is very much \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nmore thorough than ours. We rest content with a lofty ideal and \nare slow or lazy in its practice. We are wrapped in deep darkness, \nas is evident from our paupers, cattle and other animals. They are \neloquent of our irreligion rather than of religion.\u2019 \n\nHis pro-dog attitude showed he was under Western influence, \ncorrespondents charged. Patiently he reasoned with the furious. \nHe condemned some features of Western civilization and had \nlearned from others, he told them. Moreover, opinions should be \njudged by content not by their source. \n\n\u2018Letters on this subject are still pouring in,\u2019 Gandhi announced \nin the third month of the controversy, but since their only con\u00ac \ntribution was venom he ignored them. \n\nThe dog fight established the record for heat in the \u2018silent year\u2019. \nBut a little calf also precipitated a storm. A young heifer in the \nashram fell ill. Gandhi tended it and watched it suffer and decided \nit ought to be put to death. Kasturbai objected strenuously. \nThen she must go and nurse the animal, Gandhi suggested. She \ndid and the animal\u2019s torment convinced her. In Gandhi\u2019s \npresence, a doctor administered an injection which killed the \nheifer. The protest mail was heavy and fierce. Gandhi insisted \nhe had done right. \n\nFrank sex discussions filled many Letters to the Editor. \u2018My \ncorrespondence with young men on their private conduct\u2019, \nGandhi wrote, \u2018is increasing.\u2019 They asked his advice. \n\nTaking advantage of relative leisure in the \u2018silent year\u2019, Gandhi \nread Havelock Ellis, Forel, Paul Bureau\u2019s Toward Moral Bank\u00ac \nruptcy and other European authorities on family and sex. His \ninterest in the sex life of Indians always remained high. He \nbelieved that early and frequent sexual intercourse had a debilitat\u00ac \ning effect on Indians; he understood the implications of the rapid \nincrease in his country\u2019s population. (In the s, the popula\u00ac \ntion of India was increasing five million each year.) He wrapped \nthis problem too in a spiritual cloak and, taking a leaf out of \nsacred Hindu books, advocated chastity for religious reasons. \nBut the biological and economic aspects of the situation did not \nescape him. \n\nIn many articles that came from his pen, or pencil, in \u2018silent\u2019 \n and often thereafter, Gandhi consistently opposed the use of \ncontraceptives; they were a Western vice. But he did not oppose \n\n \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT\u2019 YEAR \n\n\nbirth control. He always advocated birth control. The birth \ncontrol he favoured, however, was through self-control, through \nthe power of the mind over the body. \u2018Self-control\u2019, he wrote, \u2018is \nthe surest and only method of regulating the birth rate.\u2019 Without \nsuch discipline, he contended, man was no better than a brute. \nHe maintained that abstinence for ever or for long periods was \nneither physically nor psychologically harmful. Gandhi and his \nclosest ashram associates practised Brahmacharya, complete \ncontinence; people in general, he said, might indulge in sex for \npurposes of procreation, but not to gratify animal passion. He \ndenied \u2018that sexual indulgence for its own sake is a human \nnecessity\u2019. \n\nA correspondent wrote: \u2018In my case, three weeks seem to be the \nutmost period of beneficial abstention. At the end of that period I \nusually feel a heaviness of body, a restlessness both of body and \nmind, leading to bad temper. Relief is obtained either by normal \ncoitus or nature herself coming to the rescue by an involuntary \ndischarge. Far from feeling weak or nervous, I become the next \nmorning calm and light and am able to proceed to my work \nwith added gusto.\u2019 Many similar cases were brought to Gandhi\u2019s \nnotice. \n\nDipping into his personal experience, Gandhi said in reply, \n\u2018Ability to retain and assimilate the vital liquid is a matter of \nlong training.\u2019 Once achieved, it strengthens body and mind. \nThe vital liquid, \u2018capable of producing such a wonderful being as \nman, cannot but, when properly conserved, be transmuted into \nmatchless energy and strength\u2019. \n\nRealistically, in Harijan magazine of September th, , \nGandhi wrote, \u2018Assuming that birth control by artificial aids is \njustifiable under certain conditions, it seems to be utterly im\u00ac \npracticable of application among the millions.\u2019 India was poor \nand ignorant because she was too poor and ignorant to apply \nbirth control by contraceptives. Therefore, Gandhi urged other \nmeans of reducing the population. Contraceptives led to over- \nindulgence with the result that a \u2018society that has already become \nenervated through a variety of causes will become still further \nenervated by the adoption of artificial methods\u2019. \n\nGandhi endeavoured to delay the marriage of his own sons. \nTimes without number, he attacked the institution of child marri- \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nage: \u2018Early marriages are a fruitful source of life, adding to the \npopulation . . He conceded, of course, that the earth should \nproduce enough to support all who are born on it, but, as a reli\u00ac \ngious man with a strong practical sense, he saw the necessity of \npopulation limitation. \u2018If\u2019, he wrote to Charles Freer Andrews, \n\u2018I could find a way of stopping procreation in a civil and voluntary \nmanner whilst India remains in the present miserable state I \nwould do so today.\u2019 The only manner he countenanced was \nmental discipline. To the strong and saintly he proposed lifelong \nBramacharya; to the mass, he proposed late marriage, in the mid\u00ac \ntwenties if possible and self-control thereafter. In the ashram, the \nminimum marriage age for girls was twenty-one. He recognized \nhuman frailties but insisted that unspiced food, the right kind of \nclothes, the right kind of work, walking, gymnastics, unspiced \nliterature, prayer, pure films (Indian films to this day prohibit \nkissing on the screen) and devotion to God would relieve the \ntension in modern life and conduce to the sexual self-control \nwhich most persons unthinkingly consider unnatural. Gandhi\u2019s \nwritings on these matters, though they appeared in his small- \ncirculation Young India and Gujarat Navajivan , were, like almost \neverything he said, reprinted in the entire Indian press. \n\nA cognate question attracted Gandhi\u2019s special attention during \nthe \u2018silent\u2019 year: child widows. According to the official British \ncensus for , which he cited, there were in India , \nwidows less than five years old; , widows between the ages \nof five and ten; and , widows between ten and fifteen; \ntogether , widows under sixteen. \n\n\u2018The existence of girl widows\u2019, Gandhi exclaimed, \u2018is a blot \nupon Hinduism.\u2019 Parents would marry their baby daughters to \nbaby sons of other families, or even to old men and if the husband \ndied, either in infancy or of senility, the widow could not, under \nHindu law, remarry. Defiantly, Gandhi declared, \u2018I consider \nremarriage of virgin widows not only desirable but the bounden \nduty of all parents who happen to have such widowed daughters.\u2019 \nSome of these youthful widows were no longer virgins but pros\u00ac \ntitutes. \u2018The remedy in anticipation,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018is to prevent early \nmarriages.\u2019 To those bigoted Hindus who, loyal to every immoral \ncustom, defended the proscription against second marriage of \nchild widows, Gandhi retorted, \u2018They were never married at alt.\u2019 \n\n \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT\u2019 YEAR \n\n\nThe wedding of a child is a sacrilege, not a sacred rite. His deepest \nfeeling about child widows was expressed in one sweet sentence, \n\u2018They are strangers to love.\u2019 Chastity had to be the deliberate and \nvoluntary act of a mature person, not the imposition of cruel \nparents on children. Gandhi wanted all human beings to know \nlove. But a widow, or widower, who had married as an adult \nshould not remarry, he said; they had tasted love. This proscrip\u00ac \ntion constituted another birth-control technique. \n\nProtection of the cow, protection of Indians in South Africa \nwhere race hate was again rampant, prohibition and world peace \nalso excited Gandhi\u2019s reforming zeal during his Sabbatical year. \n\nOccasionally, some proverbs dropped from his pen: \u2018Any \nsecrecy hinders the real spirit of democracy\u2019; \u2018If we could erase \nthe \u201cFs\u201d and \u201cMine\u2019s\u201d from religion, politics, economics, etc., \nwe should be free and bring heaven on earth.\u2019 Occasionally, too, \nhe made brief excursions into religion, but there was remarkably \nlittle discussion in print about God, metaphysics and kindred \ntopics. One thought he did leave with his readers: \u2018Rationalists \nare admirable beings,\u2019 he wrote in an article on the efficacy of \nprayer; \u2018rationalism is a hideous monster when it claims for itself \nomnipotence. Attribution of omnipotence to reason is as bad a \npiece of idolatry as is worship of stick and stone believing it to \nbe God ... I do not know a single rationalist who has never done \nanything in simple faith . . . But we all know millions of human \nbeings living their more or less orderly lives because of their child\u00ac \nlike faith in the Maker of us all. That very faith is a prayer ... I \nplead not for the suppression of reason, but for due recognition \nof that in us which sanctions reason itself.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Mankind cannot live by logic alone, but also needs poetry,\u2019 he \nonce wrote. Gandhi frequently left the field of sensory perception \nand rational mental processes for that middle zone of faith, in\u00ac \nstinct, intuition and love, but he never wandered away from it \ninto the rarefied realm of mystic messages, miracles, hallucinations, \nprophecy and other unaccountable manifestations of mind and \nbody. \u2018Whilst he did not rule out the authenticity of supra- \nsensuous phenomena,\u2019 says one of his closest disciples, \u2018he very \nstrongly disapproved of pursuing them.\u2019 He judged men and \nevents by the criteria of cold facts and invited others to judge him \nrationally. He did not wish to influence people by mystic radia- \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\ntion. His estimate of himself was severely sober. His work was \npractical and its goal was practical success. He told Muriel Lester, \nan Englishwoman, that he \u2018never heard a voice, saw a vision, or \nhad some recognized experience of God\u2019. No mystic experience \nhad been vouchsafed to him. His guide was reason on the wing \nof faith. \n\nGandhi\u2019s reputation abroad was spreading. Romain Rolland, \nthe French author, wrote a book about him. Many invitations \nreached him, especially from America, to come on a visit. He \nrejected them. \u2018My reason is simple,\u2019 he explained, \u2018I have not \nenough self-confidence to warrant my going to America. I have \nno doubt that the movement for non-violence has come to stay. \nI have no doubt whatsoever about its final success. But I cannot \ngive an ocular demonstration of the efficacy of non-violence. \nTill then, I feel I must continue to preach from the narrower \nIndian platform.\u2019 \n\nTwo American women, Mrs. Kelly and Mrs. Langeloth, re\u00ac \npresenting the Fellowship of Faith, the League of Neighbours and \nthe Union of East and West, actually came to Sabarmati to \ninvite the Mahatma. First they cross-examined him: \u2018Is it true \nthat you object to railways, steamships and other means of speedy \nlocomotion?\u2019 \n\n\u2018It is and it is not,\u2019 Gandhi replied patiently, for the thousandth \ntime, and urged them to read his Indian Home-Rule. More conversa\u00ac \ntion of the same kind followed. He was afraid, in the end, that \nthey did not understand his attitude to the machine and speed, \nbecause they had to catch a train and left early. \n\nGandhi was in no hurry either personally or politically, and sat \nstill for a year. He seemed to enjoy his  moratorium from \npolitics. It gave his body time to rest and his spirit a chance to \nroam. He played more with the children. He participated in an \nashram spinning contest. He and Kasturbai, the oldest members \nof the community, were beaten by the youngest, their grand\u00ac \ndaughter. The announcement evoked great hilarity. \n\nHe cultivated his friends, Rajagopalachari, the lawyer with the \nrazor-edge brain; Mahadev Desai, who was a secretary and an \napostle; and \u2018Charlie\u2019 Andrews, two years Gandhi\u2019s junior, whom \nGandhi called \u2018The Good Samaritan\u2019. He \u2018is more than a blood \nbrother to me\u2019, Gandhi said. \u2018I do not think that I can claim a \n\n \n\n\nTHE \u2018SILENT\u2019 YEAR \n\ndeeper attachment to anyone than to Mr. Andrews.\u2019 The Hindu \nsaint had found no better saint than Andrews. The Christian \nmissionary had found no better Christian than Gandhi. Perhaps \nthe Indian and Englishman were brothers because they were truly \nreligious. Perhaps religion brought them together because \nnationality did not separate them. \u2018Each country\u2019, Andrews said, \nspeaking of England and India, \u2018has become equally dear to me.\u2019 \nGandhi declared, \u2018I would not hurt England or Germany to serve \nIndia.\u2019 In a letter to Andrews dated Calcutta, December th, \n, Gandhi wrote, \u2018The most forward nationalists in India have \nnot been haters of the West or of England or in any other way \nnarrow . . . but they have been internationalists under the guise \nof nationalism.\u2019 \n\nWhere nationalism does not divide, religion can make men \nbrothers. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER XIV \n\n\nCOLLAPSE \n\nG andhi emerged from the year of silence with views un\u00ac \nchanged. His programme was still Hindu-Moslem unity, \nthe removal of untouchability and the promotion of home- \nspun. Indeed, Gandhi\u2019s programme in its simplest terms remained \nthe same for decades. The vision of the future of India which he \noutlined in  in his booklet Indian Home-Rule guided him to the \nend of his days. In , at the height of the non-co-operation \nmovement, he had sent Andrews to tell the Viceroy that if the \nGovernment would help promote home spinning and weaving in \nthe villages and suppress alcohol and opium he would drop non- \nco-operation. The Government did not reply. He would have \nsettled for khadi and prohibition at any time in his career. But \nkhadi struck at British trade and prohibition at government \nrevenue. \n\nLeaving Sabarmati Ashram in December , Gandhi worked \nhis way from meeting to meeting till he reached Gauhati, in north\u00ac \neast India, in the province of Assam, to attend the annual session \nof Congress. En route, he received word of a tragedy which horri\u00ac \nfied India. A young Moslem named Abdul Rashid had called on \nSwami Shraddhanand, a well-known Hindu nationalist, and said \nhe wished to discuss religious problems with him. The Swami, or \npriest, was ill in bed; his doctor had ordered complete repose. \nWhen the Swami heard the altercation outside his room between his \nservant and the insistent visitor he ordered the man to be admitted. \nInside, the Swami told Abdul Rashid that he would be glad to \ntalk with him as soon as he felt stronger. The Moslem asked for \nwater. When the servant left to fetch him a drink, Abdul Rashid \npulled out a revolver and fired several bullets into the Swami\u2019s \nbreast, killing him. \n\nThe Moslem press had been attacking the Swami as a pro\u00ac \nponent of Hindu domination of India. In an address to Congress, \nGandhi assured the Moslems that the Swami had not been their \nenemy. He said Abdul Rashid was not guilty. The guilty ones \n\n \n\n\nCOLLAPSE \n\n\nwere \u2018those who excited feelings of hatred against one another\u2019. \nHe referred to the assassin repeatedly as his \u2018brother\u2019. \n\nThe British too were brothers. Extreme nationalists at the Con\u00ac \ngress session moved a resolution in favour of independence and \nthe severance of all ties with England. Gandhi opposed it. \u2018They \nbetray want of faith in human nature and therefore in themselves,\u2019 \nhe said. \u2018Why do they think there can never be a change of heart \nin those who are guiding the British Empire?\u2019 If India were \ndignified and strong, England would change. \n\nGandhi accordingly continued his efforts to strengthen the \nnation from within; otherwise, resolutions in favour of indepen\u00ac \ndence were empty words and vain gestures. \n\nAgain, therefore, Gandhi toured the country. At meetings \nwhere he saw a sector of the grounds set apart for untouchables \nhe squatted among them and challenged Brahmans and other \ncaste Hindus to come and do likewise. The Mahatma on active \nservice for India could not be disobeyed. \n\nDuring some speeches, he would lift his left hand and open up \nthe five fingers. Taking the first finger between two fingers of his \nright hand he would shake it and say, \u2018This is equality for un\u00ac \ntouchables,\u2019 and even those who could not hear him would ask \nfor and get an explanation later on from those who had. Then \nthe second finger: \u2018This is spinning.\u2019 The third finger was \nsobriety; no alcohol, no opium. The fourth was Hindu-Moslem \nfriendship. The fifth was equality for women. The hand was \nbound to the body by the wrist. The wrist was non-violence. \nThe five virtues, through non-violence, would free the body of \neach one of them and, hence, India. \n\nSometimes, if he was too tired or the crowd too noisy, he would \nsit on the platform in silence till the audience, which often num\u00ac \nbered two hundred thousand, became quiet. He then continued \nto sit in silence, and the men and women sat in silence, and he \ntouched his palms together to bless them, and smiled, and de\u00ac \nparted. This was communication without words, and the mass \nsilence was an exercise in self-control and self-searching, a step \ntherefore towards self-rule. \n\nThousands of townspeople came to meetings wearing khadi. \nIn one locality, the laundry men, the indispensable men of India, \nrefused to wash anything but homespun. A primitive tribe gave \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nup alcohol when they heard it was the Mahatma\u2019s wish. His \nattacks on child marriage met with wider acceptance. Women \nmixed with men at meetings. \n\nBut the Hindu-Moslem problem defied Gandhi\u2019s efforts. \u2018I \nam helpless,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018I have now washed my hands. But \nI am a believer in God . . . Something within tells me that Hindu- \nMoslem unity will come sooner than we might care to hope, that \nGod will one day force it on us, ih spite of ourselves. That is why \nI said that it has passed into the hands of God.\u2019 This formula \ncomforted him, but it did not relax the tension. Hindus and Mos\u00ac \nlems were kidnapping one another\u2019s womenfolk and children and \nforcibly converting them. \n\nFrom Calcutta, Gandhi moved down through Bihar to the \ncountry of the Marathas, Tilak\u2019s country. At Poona, the students \ndemanded that he should speak English; their language was \nMarathi which Gandhi did not command. He started in English \nand then switched to Hindustani, which he wanted to have \naccepted as the national language. Some students were friendly; \none sold his gold medal for khadi. Some students were hostile. \nIn Bombay, however, the people overwhelmed him with kindness \nand money. It was his own Gujarat region. Thence he returned \nto Poona to take the train for Bangalore and a tour of the Carnatic, \nin south-east India. \n\nAt the Poona station, Gandhi felt so weak he had to be carried \ninto the Bangalore train. His vision was blurred and he could \nscarcely scribble an urgent note. Sleep that night refreshed him, \nand the next day, at Kolhapur, in the Deccan princely states, he \naddressed seven meetings: the untouchables insisted on their own \nmeetings and dragged Gandhi to their school. The women had a \nspecial affair; the children too; the non-Brahmans; the Christians; \nthe khadi workers; the students. At the close of the final meeting, \nGandhi collapsed. \n\nYet he went on. The next day, he felt too ill to make speeches, \nbut he sat on the porch of his host\u2019s house while multitudes passed. \nThen he drove to a meeting to receive a purse of  rupees for \nkhadi. At Belgaum, over a hundred miles from Kolhapur, he also \nattended a meeting, but did not speak. Finally, a doctor per\u00ac \nsuaded him that his condition was serious and he had to rest. He \nwas taken to a hill town swept by sea breezes. \n\n \n\n\nCOLLAPSE \n\n\nUnder pressure from his friend and physician, Dr. Jivraj Mehta, \nand others, Gandhi agreed to rest for two months. But why \ncouldn\u2019t he go home to Sabarmati where his upkeep would cost \nless money? He was told that the altitude and salubrious climate \nwould help him recover more quickly. He said he did not wish \u2018to \nvegetate\u2019. Well, he could continue working on his autobiography \nand do light reading. \n\n\u2018What is light reading?\u2019 Gandhi asked. \n\n\u2018You must not spin,\u2019 the doctor continued. \u2018Your blood pressure \nis too high.\u2019 This raised a fierce protest. \n\n\u2018Take my blood pressure before and after spinning,\u2019 Gandhi \nurged. \u2018Besides, what a glorious death to die spinning.\u2019 fie did \nspin. But he agreed not to answer correspondence, not to work. \n\n\u2018Well, my cart has stuck in the mire,\u2019 he wrote the women of \nSabarmati Ashram. \u2018Tomorrow it might break down beyond \nhope of repair. What then? Gitaji [the Bhagavad Gita ] proclaims \nthat everyone that is born must die, and everyone that dies must \nbe born again. Everyone comes, repays part of his obligation, \nand goes his way.\u2019 \n\nThe sale of khadi was medicine to Gandhi. The chief of the \nnative state and his wife came for a visit and bought some home- \nspun. Devadas and Mahadev Desai went out to peddle khadi and \ncame back with purses full. \n\nSoon Ghandi commenced to write articles for his two maga\u00ac \nzines. His blood pressure was down, he reported, \u2018from  to \n, and from  to  which is normal for my age. I have \nbeen walking for the last three days over one mile per day in two \nperiods...\u2019 He suggested a fast; that would cure him. The doctors \ndissuaded him with difficulty. They suggested recreation instead. \n\n\u2018Like backgammon, or whist or bridge, or pingpong?\u2019 Gandhi \nlaughed. \n\nThey could propose nothing definite. \n\n\u2018So your proposal has ended in smoke,\u2019 he teased. \u2018It cannot be \notherwise. What can you suggest where all work is play . . .?\u2019 He \nhad a proposition. \u2018Get me a carpenter\u2019s box of tools and broken \nspinning wheels and I shall repair them, or crooked spindles and \nI shall make them straight.\u2019 \n\nDuring April , he remained in the native state of Mysore, \nrecuperating. The prime minister of the state appeared for a visit, \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nand in the course of the conversation he assured Gandhi that he \nhad no objection to the wearing of homespun by Mysore officials. \nGandhi went to inspect the Methodist Mission School for girls at \nBangalore, capital of Mysore. He told the teachers that E. Stanley \nJones, the American missionary, had promised him to introduce \nspinning in the Methodist mission schools. He joked with the \npupils and asked them to wear khadi. \n\nDr. B. G. Roy, Gandhi\u2019s physician in later years, and Dr. \nManchershah Gilder, an Indian who practised medicine in Bom\u00ac \nbay and London, have stated that Gandhi had a \u2018slight stroke\u2019 at \nKolhapur in March . Neither found any physical after-effects. \nDr. Gilder, who was Gandhi\u2019s heart specialist after , said that \nthe Mahatma\u2019s heart was stronger than in an average man his age. \nHe never knew Gandhi\u2019s blood pressure to rise except when an \nimportant decision was in the making. On one occasion, Gandhi \nwent to bed with high blood pressure; in the morning it was \nnormal, because, during the night, he had made up his mind on \na crucial question. The presence of irritating persons, or public \nattacks on him, or concern about his work, Dr. Gilder declared, \nnever affected Gandhi\u2019s blood pressure; only the self-wrangling \nthat preceded a decision brought on a rise. \n\nThe \u2018slight stroke\u2019 of , accompanied by high blood pressure, \nmay have been due to overwork at a time when the political situa\u00ac \ntion did not permit Gandhi to reach a decision in favour of a new \ncivil disobedience campaign. From the moment he came out of \njail in , Gandhi watched for an opportunity to renew non- \nco-operation. This was his goal. Everything else was preparation \nfor it. More than ever, co-operation with the British, or even \nobstruction to the British in the legislative assemblies, appeared \nto him a waste of time. \n\nMost co-operators were loyal to Gandhi. Vithalbhai Patel, \npresident of the national Legislative Assembly at New Delhi, \nbrother of Vallabhbhai Patel, Gandhi\u2019s close associate, had been \nsending more than half his handsome British salary to Gandhi \nby cheque every month for constructive work. Others did like\u00ac \nwise. Civil disobedience, Gandhi felt, would unite co-operators \nand non-co-operators. Only civil disobedience would impel the \nBritish to yield real power; under dyarchy they yielded the \nsemblance of power. \n\n\n \n\n\nCOLLAPSE \n\n\nBut \u2018the present look of things\u2019 between Hindus and Moslems, \nGandhi wrote in Young India of June th, , was \u2018ugly\u2019. He \nyearned to do something, perhaps to fast, in order to \u2018melt and \nchange the stony hearts of Hindus and Moslems. But I have no \nsign from God within to undertake the penance\u2019. \n\nHindu-Moslem dissension, Gandhi said, proved that Indians \ncould not regulate their own affairs. Then what claim had they \non the British for more power? It was not enough to reply that \nBritain made use of their division or even created it. Why did \nIndians give England this advantage? \n\nGandhi put his faith in God; when all seemed lost perhaps the \nBritish would help. They did. \n\nLord Irwin, the new Viceroy, had arrived in India in April \n, at the age of forty-five, to relieve Reading. From his grand\u00ac \nfather, the first Viscount Halifax, who had served in India and as \nSecretary of State for India in Whitehall, he inherited a bond \nwith India. From his father he acquired an attachment to the \nChurch of England and High Church views. In fact, on his arrival, \non Good Friday, in Bombay, he postponed the ceremonies that \naccompany the advent of a new Viceroy and went to church. \n\nThe choice of a religious man as Viceroy was regarded in some \nquarters as auspicious for his five-year reign over a religious \ncountry in which a Mahatma led the opposition. \n\nBut for nineteen months, Irwin sent no invitation to Gandhi nor \nindicated any desire to discuss the Indian situation with the most \ninfluential Indian. On October th, , while filling speaker \nengagements at Mangalore, on the west coast, a message reached \nGandhi that the Viceroy wished to see him on November th. \n\nThe Mahatma immediately broke off his tour and travelled the \n miles \u2014 a two-day train journey \u2014 to New Delhi. At the \nappointed hour he was ushered into the presence of Lord Irwin. \nHe did not enter alone. The Viceroy had also asked Vithalbai \nPatel, the president of the national Legislative Assembly, S. \nSrinivasa Iyengar, the president of the Congress party for , \nand Dr. M. A. Ansari, the president-elect of Congress for . \n\nWhen the Indians had been seated, Irwin handed them a paper \nannouncing the impending arrival of an official British commission, \nled by Sir John Simon, to report on Indian conditions and make \nrecommendations for political reforms. \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nHaving read the text, Gandhi looked up and waited. The \nViceroy said nothing. \n\nTs this the only business of our meeting?\u2019 Gandhi asked. \n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied the Viceroy. \n\nThat was the end of the interview. Silently, Gandhi returned to \nsouthern India and from there went on to Ceylon to collect \nmoney for khadi. \n\nIn the days following Irwin\u2019s confrontation with Gandhi, other \nIndian leaders were informed, in similar fashion, of the forth\u00ac \ncoming visit of the Simon Commission. In no case was there any \ndiscussion or elaboration. The Viceroy simply said that under \nSection a of the Government of India Act of , which pro\u00ac \nvided for ten-year surveys, a Statutory Commission consisting of \nSir John Simon and six other members of the British House of \nCommons and House of Lords would soon arrive in India to \ninvestigate and to suggest changes, if any were necessary, in the \nIndian political system. Irwin expected Indians to testify before \nthe commission and submit proposals to it. \n\nIrwin\u2019s biographer, Alan Campbell Johnson, describes this \nepisode as \u2018a deplorable lack of tact in the handling of the Indian \nleaders\u2019. The blame was shared by Irwin and Lord Birkenhead, \nthe Secretary of State for India in the British government. Birken\u00ac \nhead, a brilliant lawyer, made Indian policy in Whitehall. In \ndoing so he was guided by an attitude epitomized in his pro\u00ac \nnouncement in the House of Lords in . \u2018What man in this \nHouse\u2019, Birkenhead asked rhetorically, \u2018can say that he can see \nin a generation, in two generations, in a hundred years, any pro\u00ac \nspect that the people of India will be in a position to assume con\u00ac \ntrol of the Army, the Navy, the Civil Service, and to have a Gover\u00ac \nnor-General who will be responsible to the Indian government \nand not to any authority in this country?\u2019 The legal mind had no \neyes; yet he, with Irwin, ruled India. \n\nThe Simon Commission was the premature child of Birken\u00ac \nhead\u2019s brain. Under the Act of , the commission might have \nbeen created a year or two later, but a national election was \nimminent in Britain, and Birkenhead feared that his Tory party \nmight be defeated by Labour, as indeed it was, in . This \nbeing the case, the Indians were all the more disappointed that \nthe Labour party should have lent itself to Birkenhead\u2019s manoeuvre \n\n \n\n\nCOLLAPSE \n\nby allowing Major Clement R. Attlee, then a less-known M.P., to \nserve with Simon. \n\nThe news of the Simon Commission astounded India. The \nCommission would determine the fate of India, but it had no \nIndian member. The British explained that it was a commission \nof Parliament and must therefore consist of peers or M.P.s. But \nthere was an Indian peer, Lord Sinha. No, India did not accept \nthe explanation. Indians were being treated as \u2018natives\u2019; the \nwhites would come, look around, and decide the fate of the dumb, \nbrown Asiatics. Are these the fruits of co-operation, the Gandhian \nnon-co-operators scoffed. \n\nSpontaneously, a movement sprang up throughout India not \nto help the Simon Commission in its studies, nor to lay plans before \nit. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, a great Indian constitutional lawyer, \nformer member of the Viceroy\u2019s Advisory Council, persuaded the \nLiberal party of India to vote for boycott. The Hindu Mahasabha \nwavered for a moment and then followed the lead of Pandit \nMadan Malaviya into the boycott camp. Congress was of course \nunanimous for boycott, and needed no promptings from Gandhi. \nMr. Jinnah, of the revived Moslem League, also seemed inclined \nto join the boycott. Irwin, according to his biographer, \u2018did his \nutmost to bring Jinnah back into the fold and made a substantial \noffer to him\u2019. But a rude speech by Birkenhead challenging \nIndians to produce \u2018an agreed scheme\u2019 of future government con\u00ac \nvinced Jinnah that the British were playing on Indian religious \ndivisions and caused him to spurn the Viceroy\u2019s \u2018substantial \noffer\u2019. One touch of Birkenhead made all Indians non-co- \noperate. \n\nUpon its arrival in Bombay on February rd, , the Simon \nCommission was greeted with black flags and processions shouting, \n\u2018Go back, Simon.\u2019 This slogan, chanted by Indians who some\u00ac \ntimes knew no other English words, rang in the commissioners\u2019 \nears throughout their stay in India. The boycott was political \nand social. The commission was isolated. \n\nSimon tried his hand at compromise. Irwin tempted and \ncajoled. A few bitter or ambitious untouchables and a handful \nof very minor politicians were induced to come before the \nSimonites. But no representative Indian would see them. They \ntoiled honestly, and produced an intelligently edited compendium \n\ns m.g.  \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nof valuable facts and statistics. It was a learned epitaph on British \n\nrule. \n\nThe first Gandhi-Irwin interview of November th, , stood \nfor inequality; the composition of the Simon Commission stood \nfor exclusion. Both principles angered Gandhi and the Indian \npeople. \n\nBy , however, Gandhi had changed the relationship be\u00ac \ntween India and England to one of negotiation between hard \nbargainers. By , automatic Indian obedience to British fiat \nwas a thing of the past. Imperceptibly, in ,  and , \nunknown even to themselves, and scarcely noticed by outsiders, \nIndians became free men. The body still wore shackles; but the \nspirit had escaped from prison. Gandhi had turned the key. No \ngeneral directing armies against an enemy ever moved with more \nconsummate skill than the saint armed with righteousness as his \nshield and a moral cause as his spear. All of Gandhi\u2019s years in \nSouth Africa were preparation for the - struggle; all his \nwork in India since  prepared the Indian people for it. He \ndid not plan it that way. But in perspective his activities make a \ndelicate design. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n CHAPTER XIV \n\n\nCOLLAPSE \n\nG andhi emerged from the year of silence with views un\u00ac \nchanged. His programme was still Hindu-Moslem unity, \nthe removal of untouchability and the promotion of home- \nspun. Indeed, Gandhi\u2019s programme in its simplest terms remained \nthe same for decades. The vision of the future of India which he \noutlined in  in his booklet Indian Home-Rule guided him to the \nend of his days. In , at the height of the non-co-operation \nmovement, he had sent Andrews to tell the Viceroy that if the \nGovernment would help promote home spinning and weaving in \nthe villages and suppress alcohol and opium he would drop non- \nco-operation. The Government did not reply. He would have \nsettled for khadi and prohibition at any time in his career. But \nkhadi struck at British trade and prohibition at government \nrevenue. \n\nLeaving Sabarmati Ashram in December , Gandhi worked \nhis way from meeting to meeting till he reached Gauhati, in north\u00ac \neast India, in the province of Assam, to attend the annual session \nof Congress. En route, he received word of a tragedy which horri\u00ac \nfied India. A young Moslem named Abdul Rashid had called on \nSwami Shraddhanand, a well-known Hindu nationalist, and said \nhe wished to discuss religious problems with him. The Swami, or \npriest, was ill in bed; his doctor had ordered complete repose. \nWhen the Swami heard the altercation outside his room between his \nservant and the insistent visitor he ordered the man to be admitted. \nInside, the Swami told Abdul Rashid that he would be glad to \ntalk with him as soon as he felt stronger. The Moslem asked for \nwater. When the servant left to fetch him a drink, Abdul Rashid \npulled out a revolver and fired several bullets into the Swami\u2019s \nbreast, killing him. \n\nThe Moslem press had been attacking the Swami as a pro\u00ac \nponent of Hindu domination of India. In an address to Congress, \nGandhi assured the Moslems that the Swami had not been their \nenemy. He said Abdul Rashid was not guilty. The guilty ones \n\n \n\n\nCOLLAPSE \n\n\nwere \u2018those who excited feelings of hatred against one another\u2019. \nHe referred to the assassin repeatedly as his \u2018brother\u2019. \n\nThe British too were brothers. Extreme nationalists at the Con\u00ac \ngress session moved a resolution in favour of independence and \nthe severance of all ties with England. Gandhi opposed it. \u2018They \nbetray want of faith in human nature and therefore in themselves,\u2019 \nhe said. \u2018Why do they think there can never be a change of heart \nin those who are guiding the British Empire?\u2019 If India were \ndignified and strong, England would change. \n\nGandhi accordingly continued his efforts to strengthen the \nnation from within; otherwise, resolutions in favour of indepen\u00ac \ndence were empty words and vain gestures. \n\nAgain, therefore, Gandhi toured the country. At meetings \nwhere he saw a sector of the grounds set apart for untouchables \nhe squatted among them and challenged Brahmans and other \ncaste Hindus to come and do likewise. The Mahatma on active \nservice for India could not be disobeyed. \n\nDuring some speeches, he would lift his left hand and open up \nthe five fingers. Taking the first finger between two fingers of his \nright hand he would shake it and say, \u2018This is equality for un\u00ac \ntouchables,\u2019 and even those who could not hear him would ask \nfor and get an explanation later on from those who had. Then \nthe second finger: \u2018This is spinning.\u2019 The third finger was \nsobriety; no alcohol, no opium. The fourth was Hindu-Moslem \nfriendship. The fifth was equality for women. The hand was \nbound to the body by the wrist. The wrist was non-violence. \nThe five virtues, through non-violence, would free the body of \neach one of them and, hence, India. \n\nSometimes, if he was too tired or the crowd too noisy, he would \nsit on the platform in silence till the audience, which often num\u00ac \nbered two hundred thousand, became quiet. He then continued \nto sit in silence, and the men and women sat in silence, and he \ntouched his palms together to bless them, and smiled, and de\u00ac \nparted. This was communication without words, and the mass \nsilence was an exercise in self-control and self-searching, a step \ntherefore towards self-rule. \n\nThousands of townspeople came to meetings wearing khadi. \nIn one locality, the laundry men, the indispensable men of India, \nrefused to wash anything but homespun. A primitive tribe gave \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nup alcohol when they heard it was the Mahatma\u2019s wish. His \nattacks on child marriage met with wider acceptance. Women \nmixed with men at meetings. \n\nBut the Hindu-Moslem problem defied Gandhi\u2019s efforts. \u2018I \nam helpless,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018I have now washed my hands. But \nI am a believer in God . . . Something within tells me that Hindu- \nMoslem unity will come sooner than we might care to hope, that \nGod will one day force it on us, ih spite of ourselves. That is why \nI said that it has passed into the hands of God.\u2019 This formula \ncomforted him, but it did not relax the tension. Hindus and Mos\u00ac \nlems were kidnapping one another\u2019s womenfolk and children and \nforcibly converting them. \n\nFrom Calcutta, Gandhi moved down through Bihar to the \ncountry of the Marathas, Tilak\u2019s country. At Poona, the students \ndemanded that he should speak English; their language was \nMarathi which Gandhi did not command. He started in English \nand then switched to Hindustani, which he wanted to have \naccepted as the national language. Some students were friendly; \none sold his gold medal for khadi. Some students were hostile. \nIn Bombay, however, the people overwhelmed him with kindness \nand money. It was his own Gujarat region. Thence he returned \nto Poona to take the train for Bangalore and a tour of the Carnatic, \nin south-east India. \n\nAt the Poona station, Gandhi felt so weak he had to be carried \ninto the Bangalore train. His vision was blurred and he could \nscarcely scribble an urgent note. Sleep that night refreshed him, \nand the next day, at Kolhapur, in the Deccan princely states, he \naddressed seven meetings: the untouchables insisted on their own \nmeetings and dragged Gandhi to their school. The women had a \nspecial affair; the children too; the non-Brahmans; the Christians; \nthe khadi workers; the students. At the close of the final meeting, \nGandhi collapsed. \n\nYet he went on.

Vithalbhai Patel, \npresident of the national Legislative Assembly at New Delhi, \nbrother of Vallabhbhai Patel, Gandhi\u2019s close associate, had been \nsending more than half his handsome British salary to Gandhi \nby cheque every month for constructive work. Others did like\u00ac \nwise. Civil disobedience, Gandhi felt, would unite co-operators \nand non-co-operators. Only civil disobedience would impel the \nBritish to yield real power; under dyarchy they yielded the \nsemblance of power. \n\n\n \n\n\nCOLLAPSE \n\n\nBut \u2018the present look of things\u2019 between Hindus and Moslems, \nGandhi wrote in Young India of June th, , was \u2018ugly\u2019. He \nyearned to do something, perhaps to fast, in order to \u2018melt and \nchange the stony hearts of Hindus and Moslems. But I have no \nsign from God within to undertake the penance\u2019. \n\nHindu-Moslem dissension, Gandhi said, proved that Indians \ncould not regulate their own affairs. Then what claim had they \non the British for more power? It was not enough to reply that \nBritain made use of their division or even created it. Why did \nIndians give England this advantage? \n\nGandhi put his faith in God; when all seemed lost perhaps the \nBritish would help. They did. \n\nLord Irwin, the new Viceroy, had arrived in India in April \n, at the age of forty-five, to relieve Reading. From his grand\u00ac \nfather, the first Viscount Halifax, who had served in India and as \nSecretary of State for India in Whitehall, he inherited a bond \nwith India. From his father he acquired an attachment to the \nChurch of England and High Church views. In fact, on his arrival, \non Good Friday, in Bombay, he postponed the ceremonies that \naccompany the advent of a new Viceroy and went to church. \n\nThe choice of a religious man as Viceroy was regarded in some \nquarters as auspicious for his five-year reign over a religious \ncountry in which a Mahatma led the opposition. \n\nBut for nineteen months, Irwin sent no invitation to Gandhi nor \nindicated any desire to discuss the Indian situation with the most \ninfluential Indian. On October th, , while filling speaker \nengagements at Mangalore, on the west coast, a message reached \nGandhi that the Viceroy wished to see him on November th. \n\nThe Mahatma immediately broke off his tour and travelled the \n miles \u2014 a two-day train journey \u2014 to New Delhi. At the \nappointed hour he was ushered into the presence of Lord Irwin. \nHe did not enter alone. The Viceroy had also asked Vithalbai \nPatel, the president of the national Legislative Assembly, S. \nSrinivasa Iyengar, the president of the Congress party for , \nand Dr. M. A. Ansari, the president-elect of Congress for . \n\nWhen the Indians had been seated, Irwin handed them a paper \nannouncing the impending arrival of an official British commission, \nled by Sir John Simon, to report on Indian conditions and make \nrecommendations for political reforms. \n\n \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\n\nHaving read the text, Gandhi looked up and waited. The \nViceroy said nothing. \n\nTs this the only business of our meeting?\u2019 Gandhi asked. \n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied the Viceroy. \n\nThat was the end of the interview. Silently, Gandhi returned to \nsouthern India and from there went on to Ceylon to collect \nmoney for khadi. \n\nIn the days following Irwin\u2019s confrontation with Gandhi, other \nIndian leaders were informed, in similar fashion, of the forth\u00ac \ncoming visit of the Simon Commission. In no case was there any \ndiscussion or elaboration. The Viceroy simply said that under \nSection a of the Government of India Act of , which pro\u00ac \nvided for ten-year surveys, a Statutory Commission consisting of \nSir John Simon and six other members of the British House of \nCommons and House of Lords would soon arrive in India to \ninvestigate and to suggest changes, if any were necessary, in the \nIndian political system. Irwin expected Indians to testify before \nthe commission and submit proposals to it. \n\nIrwin\u2019s biographer, Alan Campbell Johnson, describes this \nepisode as \u2018a deplorable lack of tact in the handling of the Indian \nleaders\u2019. The blame was shared by Irwin and Lord Birkenhead, \nthe Secretary of State for India in the British government. Birken\u00ac \nhead, a brilliant lawyer, made Indian policy in Whitehall. In \ndoing so he was guided by an attitude epitomized in his pro\u00ac \nnouncement in the House of Lords in . \u2018What man in this \nHouse\u2019, Birkenhead asked rhetorically, \u2018can say that he can see \nin a generation, in two generations, in a hundred years, any pro\u00ac \nspect that the people of India will be in a position to assume con\u00ac \ntrol of the Army, the Navy, the Civil Service, and to have a Gover\u00ac \nnor-General who will be responsible to the Indian government \nand not to any authority in this country?\u2019 The legal mind had no \neyes; yet he, with Irwin, ruled India. \n\nThe Simon Commission was the premature child of Birken\u00ac \nhead\u2019s brain. Under the Act of , the commission might have \nbeen created a year or two later, but a national election was \nimminent in Britain, and Birkenhead feared that his Tory party \nmight be defeated by Labour, as indeed it was, in . This \nbeing the case, the Indians were all the more disappointed that \nthe Labour party should have lent itself to Birkenhead\u2019s manoeuvre \n\n \n\n\nCOLLAPSE \n\nby allowing Major Clement R. Attlee, then a less-known M.P., to \nserve with Simon. \n\nThe news of the Simon Commission astounded India. The \nCommission would determine the fate of India, but it had no \nIndian member. The British explained that it was a commission \nof Parliament and must therefore consist of peers or M.P.s. But \nthere was an Indian peer, Lord Sinha. No, India did not accept \nthe explanation. Indians were being treated as \u2018natives\u2019; the \nwhites would come, look around, and decide the fate of the dumb, \nbrown Asiatics. Are these the fruits of co-operation, the Gandhian \nnon-co-operators scoffed. \n\nSpontaneously, a movement sprang up throughout India not \nto help the Simon Commission in its studies, nor to lay plans before \nit. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, a great Indian constitutional lawyer, \nformer member of the Viceroy\u2019s Advisory Council, persuaded the \nLiberal party of India to vote for boycott. The Hindu Mahasabha \nwavered for a moment and then followed the lead of Pandit \nMadan Malaviya into the boycott camp. Congress was of course \nunanimous for boycott, and needed no promptings from Gandhi. \nMr. Jinnah, of the revived Moslem League, also seemed inclined \nto join the boycott. Irwin, according to his biographer, \u2018did his \nutmost to bring Jinnah back into the fold and made a substantial \noffer to him\u2019. But a rude speech by Birkenhead challenging \nIndians to produce \u2018an agreed scheme\u2019 of future government con\u00ac \nvinced Jinnah that the British were playing on Indian religious \ndivisions and caused him to spurn the Viceroy\u2019s \u2018substantial \noffer\u2019. One touch of Birkenhead made all Indians non-co- \noperate. \n\nUpon its arrival in Bombay on February rd, , the Simon \nCommission was greeted with black flags and processions shouting, \n\u2018Go back, Simon.\u2019 This slogan, chanted by Indians who some\u00ac \ntimes knew no other English words, rang in the commissioners\u2019 \nears throughout their stay in India. The boycott was political \nand social. The commission was isolated. \n\nSimon tried his hand at compromise. Irwin tempted and \ncajoled. A few bitter or ambitious untouchables and a handful \nof very minor politicians were induced to come before the \nSimonites. But no representative Indian would see them. They \ntoiled honestly, and produced an intelligently edited compendium \n\ns m.g.  \n\n\nGANDHI IN INDIA \n\nof valuable facts and statistics. It was a learned epitaph on British \n\nrule. \n\nThe first Gandhi-Irwin interview of November th, , stood \nfor inequality; the composition of the Simon Commission stood \nfor exclusion. Both principles angered Gandhi and the Indian \npeople. \n\nBy , however, Gandhi had changed the relationship be\u00ac \ntween India and England to one of negotiation between hard \nbargainers. By , automatic Indian obedience to British fiat \nwas a thing of the past. Imperceptibly, in ,  and , \nunknown even to themselves, and scarcely noticed by outsiders, \nIndians became free men. The body still wore shackles; but the \nspirit had escaped from prison. Gandhi had turned the key. No \ngeneral directing armies against an enemy ever moved with more \nconsummate skill than the saint armed with righteousness as his \nshield and a moral cause as his spear. All of Gandhi\u2019s years in \nSouth Africa were preparation for the - struggle; all his \nwork in India since  prepared the Indian people for it. He \ndid not plan it that way. But in perspective his activities make a \ndelicate design. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n"
