    "1888-1892": " Though I had acquired a nodding acquaintance with Hinduism and other  religions of the world, I should have known that it would not be  enough to save me in my trails. Of the thing that sustains him  through trials man has no inkling, much less knowledge, at the time.  If an unbeliever, he will attribute his safety to chance. If a  believer, he will say God saved him. He will conclude, as well he  may, that his religious study or spiritual discipline was at the  back of the state of grace within him. But in the hour of his  deliverance he does not know whether his spiritual discipline or  something else saves. Who that has prided himself on his  spiritual strength has not seen it humbled to the dust? A knowledge  of religion, as distinguished from experience, seems but chaff in  such moments of trial.  It was in England that I first discovered the  futility of mere religious knowledge. How I was saved on previous  occasions is more than I can say, for I was very young then; but now  I was twenty and had gained some experience as husband and father. During the last year, as far as I can remember, of my stay in England, that  is in , there was a Vegetarian Conference at Portsmouth to which  an Indian friend and I were invited. Portsmouth is a sea-port with a  large naval population. It has many houses with women of ill fame,  women not actually prostitutes, but at the same time, not very  scrupulous about their morals. We were put up in one of these  houses. Needles to say, the Reception Committee did not know  anything about it. It would have been difficult in a town like  Portsmouth to find out which were good lodgings and which were bad  for occasional travelers like us. We returned from the Conference in the evening. After dinner we sat  down to play a rubber of bridge, in which our landlady joined, as is  customary in England even in respectable households. Every player  indulges in innocent jokes as a matter of course, but here my  companion and our hostess began to make indecent ones as well. I did  not know that my friend was an adept in the art. It captured me and  I also joined in. Just when I was about to go beyond the limit,  leaving the cards and the game to themselves, God through the good  companion uttered the blessed warning: 'Whence this devil in you, my  boy? Be off, quick!' I was ashamed. I took the warning and expressed within myself gratefulness  to my friend. Remembering the vow I had taken before my mother, I  fled from the scene. To my room I went quaking, trembling, and with  beating heart, like a quarry escaped from its pursuer. I recall this as the first occasion on which a woman, other than my wife,  moved me to lust. I passed that night sleeplessly, all kinds of  thoughts assailing me. Should I leave this house? Should I run away  from the place? Where was I? What would happen to me if I had not my  wits about me? I decided to act thenceforth with great caution; not  to leave the house, but somehow leave Portsmouth. The Conference was  not to go on for more than two days, and I remember I left  Portsmouth the next evening, my companion staying there some time  longer. I did not then know the essence of religion or of God, and how He works in us.  Only vaguely I understood that God had saved me on that occasion. On  all occasions of trial He has saved me. I know that the phrase 'God  saved me' has a deeper meaning for me today, and still I feel that I  have not yet grasped its entire meaning. Only richer experience can  help me to a fuller understanding. But in all my trials \u2013 of a  spiritual nature, as a lawyer, in conducting institutions, and in  politics \u2013 I can say that God saved me. When every hope is gone. 'when  helpers fail and comforts flee,' I find that help arrives somehow,  from I know not where. Supplication, worship, prayer are no  superstition; they are acts more real than the acts of eating,  drinking, sitting or walking. It is no exaggeration to say that they  alone are real, all else is unreal. Such worship or prayer is no flight of eloquence; it is no lip-homage. It  springs from the heart. If, therefore, we achieve that purity of the  heart when it is 'emptied of all but love', if we keep all the  chords in proper tune, they 'trembling pass in music out of sight'.  Prayer needs no speech. It is in itself independent of any sensuous  effort. I have not the slightest doubt that prayer is an unfailing  means of cleansing the heart of passions. But it must be combined  with the utmost humility. Just about this time Narayan Hemchandra came to England. I had heard of  him as a writer. We met at the house of Miss Manning of the National  Indian Association. Miss Manning knew that I could not make myself  sociable. When I went to her place I used to sit tongue-tied, never  speaking except when spoken to. She introduced me to Narayan  Hemchandra. He did not know English. His dress was queer \u2013 a clumsy  pair of trousers, a wrinkled, dirty, brown coat after the Parsi  fashion, no necktie or collar, and a tasseled woolen cap. He grew a  long beard. He was lightly built and short of stature. His round face was scarred with  small-pox, and had a nose which was neither pointed nor blunt. With  his hand he was constantly turning over his beard. Such a queer-looking and queerly dressed person was bound to be singled out  in fashionable society. 'I have heard a good deal about you,' I said to him. 'I have also read some  of your writings. I should be very pleased if you were kind enough  to come to my place.' Narayan Hemchandra had a rather hoarse voice. With a smile on his face he  replied: 'Yes, where do you stay?' 'In Store Street.' 'Then we are neighbours. I want to learn English. Will you teach me?' 'I shall be happy to teach you anything I can, and will try my best. If you  like, I will go to your place.' 'Oh, no. I shall come to you. I shall also bring with me a Translation  Exercise Book.' So we made an appointment. Soon we were close  friends. Narayan Hemchandra was innocent of grammar. 'Horse' was a verb with him and  'run' a noun. I remember many such funny instances. But he was not  to be baffled by his ignorance. My little knowledge of grammar could  make no impression on him. Certainly he never regarded his ignorance  of grammar as a matter for shame. With perfect nonchalance he said: 'I have never been to school like you.  I have never felt the need of grammar in expressing my thoughts.  Well, do you know Bengali? I know it. I have travelled in Bengal. It  is I who have given Maharshi Devendranath Tagore's works to the  Gujarati-speaking world. And I wish to translate into Gujarati the  treasures of many other languages. I always content myself with  bringing out the spirit. Others, with their better knowledge, may be  able to do more in future. But I am quite satisfied with what I have  achieved without the help of grammar. I know Marathi, Hindi,  Bengali, and now I have begun to know English. What I want is a  copious vocabulary. And do you think my ambition ends here? No fear.  I want to go to France and learn French. I am told that language has  an extensive literature. I shall go to Germany also, if possible,  and there learn German.' And thus he would talk on unceasingly. He  had a boundless ambition for learning languages and for foreign  travel. 'Then you will go to America also?' 'Certainly. How can I return to India without having seen the New World?' 'But where will you find the money?' 'What do I need money for? I am not a fashionable fellow like you. The  minimum amount of food and the minimum amount of clothing suffice  for me. And for this what little I get out of my books and from my  friends is enough. I always travel third class. While going to  America also I shall travel on deck.' Narayan Hemchandra's simplicity was all his own, and his frankness was on a  par with it. Of pride he had not the slightest trace, excepting, of  course, a rather undue regard for his own capacity as a writer. We met daily. There was a considerable amount of similarity between our  thoughts and actions. Both of us were vegetarians. We would often  have our lunch together. This was the time when I lived on s a  week and cooked for myself. Sometimes when I would go to his room,  and sometimes he would come to mine. I cooked in the English style.  Nothing but Indian style would satisfy him. He would not do without dal. I would make soup of carrots etc., and he would pity me for my  taste. Once he somehow hunted out mung cooked it  and brought it to my place. I ate it with delight. This led on to a  regular system of exchange between us. I would take my delicacies to  him and he would bring his to me. Cardinal Manning's name was then on every lip. The dock labourers' strike had  come to an early termination owing to the efforts of John Burns and  Cardinal Manning. I told Narayan Hemchandra of Disraeli's tribute to  the Cardinal's simplicity. 'Then I must see the sage', said he. 'He is a big man. How do you expect to meet him?' 'Why? I know how. I must get you to write to him in my name. Tell him I am  an author and that I want to congratulate him personally on his  humanitarian work, and also say that I shall have to take you as  interpreter as I do not know English.' I wrote a letter to that effect. In two or three days came Cardinal Manning's  card in reply giving us an appointment. So we both called on the  Cardinal. I put on the usual visiting suit. Narayan Hemchandra was  the same as ever, in the same coat and the same trousers. I tried to  make fun of this, but he laughed me out and said: 'You civilized fellows are all cowards. Great men never look at a  person's exterior. They think of his heart.' We entered the Cardinal's mansion. As soon as we were seated, a thin,  tall, old gentleman made his appearance, and shook hands with us.  Narayan Hemchandra thus gave his greetings: 'I do not want to take up your time. I had heard a lot about you and I felt I  should come and thank you for the good work you have done for the  strikers. It has been my custom to visit the sages of the world and  that is why I have put you to this trouble.' This was of course my translation of that he spoke in Gujarati. 'I am glad you have come. I hope your stay in London will agree with you  and that you will get in touch with people here. God bless you.' With these words the Cardinal stood up and said good-bye. Once Narayan Hemchandra came to my place in a shirt and dhoti.  The good landlady opened the door, came running to me in a fright \u2013 this was a new landlady who did not know Narayan Hemchandra \u2013 and  said: 'A sort of a madcap wants to see you.' I went to the door and  to my surprise found Narayan Hemchandra. I was shocked. His face,  however, showed nothing but his usual smile. 'But did not the children in the street rag you?' 'Well, they ran after me, but I did not mind them and they were quiet.' Narayan Hemchandra went to Paris after a few months' stay in London. He  began studying French and also translating French books. I knew  enough French to revise his translation, so he gave it to me to  read. It was not a translation, it was the substance. Finally he carried out his determination to visit America. It was with great  difficulty that he succeeded in securing a deck ticket. While in the  United States he was prosecuted for 'being indecently dressed', as  he once went out in a shirt and dhoti.  I have a recollection that he was discharged. There was a great Exhibition at Paris in . I had read about its  elaborate preparations, and I also had a keen desire to see Paris.  So I thought I had better combine two things in one and go there at  this juncture. A particular attraction of the Exhibition was the  Eiffel Tower, constructed entirely of iron, and nearly , feet  high. There were of course many other things of interest, but the  Tower was the chief one, inasmuch as it had been supposed till then  that a structure of that height could not safely stand. I had heard of a vegetarian restaurant in Paris. I engaged a room there  and stayed seven days. I managed everything very economically, both  the journey to Paris and the sight-seeing there. This I did mostly  on foot and with the help of a map of Paris, as also a map of and  guide to the Exhibition. These were enough to direct one to the main  streets and chief places of interest. I remember nothing of the Exhibition excepting its magnitude and  variety. I have fair recollection of the Eiffel Tower as I ascended  it twice or thrice. There was a restaurant on the first platform,  and just for the satisfaction of being able to say that I had had my  lunch at a great height, I threw away seven shillings on it. The ancient churches of Paris are still in my memory. Their grandeur and  their peacefulness are unforgettable. The wonderful construction of  Notre Dame and the elaborate decoration of the interior with its  beautiful sculptures cannot be forgotten. I felt then that those who  expended millions on such divine cathedrals could not but have the  love of God in their hearts. I had read a lot about the fashions and frivolity of Paris. These were in  evidence in every street, but the churches stood noticeably apart  from these scenes. A man would forget the outside noise and bustle  as soon as he entered one of these churches. His manner would  change, he would behave with dignity and reverence as he passed  someone kneeling before the image of the Virgin. The feeling I had  then has since been growing on me, that all this kneeling and prayer  could not be mere superstition; the devout souls kneeling before the  Virgin could not be worshipping mere marble. They were fired with  genuine devotion and they worshipped not stone, but the divinity of  which it was symbolic. I have an impression that I felt then that by  this worship they were not detracting from, but increasing, the  glory of God. I must say a word about the Eiffel Tower. I do not know what purpose it  serves today. But I then heard it greatly disparaged as well as  praised. I remember that Tolstoy was the chief among those who  disparaged it. He said that the Eiffel Tower was a monument of man's  folly, not of his wisdom. Tobacco, he argued, was the worst of all  intoxicants, inasmuch as a man addicted to it was tempted to commit  crimes which a drunkard never dared to do; liquor made a man mad,  but tobacco clouded his intellect and made him build castles in the  air. The Eiffel Tower was one of the creations of a man under such  influence. There is no art about the Eiffel Tower. In no way can it  be said to have contributed to the real beauty of the Exhibition.  Men flocked to see it and ascended it as it was a novelty and of  unique dimensions. It was the toy of the Exhibition. So long as we  are children we are attracted by toys, and the Tower was a good  demonstration of the fact that we are all children attracted by  trinkets. That may be claimed to be the purpose served by the Eiffel  Tower. I was elected to the Executive Committee of the Vegetarian Society, and made it a  point to attend every one of its meetings, but I always felt  tongue-tied. Dr. Oldfield once said to me, 'You talk to me quite all  right, but why is it that you never open your lips at a committee  meeting? You are a drone.' I appreciated the banter. The bees are ever  busy, the drone is a thorough idler. And it was not a little curious  that whilst others expressed their opinions at these meetings, I sat  quite silent. Not that I never felt tempted to speak. But I was at a  loss to know how to express myself. All the rest of the members appeared  to me to be better informed than I. Then it often happened that just  when I had mustered up courage to speak, a fresh subject would be  started. This went on for a long time. Meantime a serious question came up for discussion. I thought it wrong to be  absent, and felt it cowardice to register a silent vote. The discussion  arose somewhat in this wise. The President of the Society was Mr. Hills,  proprietor of the Thames Iron Works. He was a puritan. It may be said  that the existence of the Society depended practically on his financial  assistance. Many members of the Committee were more or less his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.  Dr. Allinson of vegetarian fame was also a member of the Committee. He  was an advocate of the then new birth control movement, and preached its  methods among the working classes. Mr. Hills regarded these methods as  cutting at the root of morals. He thought that the Vegetarian Society  had for its object not only dietetic but also moral reform, and that a  man of Dr. Allinson's anti-puritanic views should not be allowed to  remain in the Society. A motion was therefore brought for his removal.  The question deeply interested me. I considered Dr. Allinson's views  regarding artificial methods of birth control as dangerous, and I  believed that Mr. Hills was entitled, as a puritan, to oppose him. I had  a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I thought it was  quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because  he refused to regard puritan morals as one of the objects of the  society. Mr. Hills' view regarding the exclusion of anti-puritans from  the Society was personal to himself, and it had nothing to do with the  declared object of the Society, which was simply the promotion of  vegetarianism and not of any system of morality. I therefore held that  any vegetarian could be a member of the Society irrespective of his  views on other morals. There were in the Committee others also who shared my view, but I felt myself  personally called upon to express my own. How to do it was the question.  I had not the courage to speak and I therefore decided to set down my  thoughts in writing. I went to the meeting with the document in my  pocket. So far as I recollect, I did not find myself equal even to  reading it, and the President had it read by someone else. Dr. Allinson  lost the day. Thus in the very first battle of the kind I found myself  siding with the losing party. But I had comfort in the thought that the  cause was right. I have a faint recollection that, after this incident,  I resigned from the Committee. This shyness I retained throughout my stay in England. Even when I paid a social call  the presence of half a dozen or more people would strike me dumb. I once went to Ventnor with Sjt. Mazmudar. We stayed there with a vegetarian family.  Mr. Howard, the author of The Ethics of Diet,  was also staying at the same watering-place. We met him, and he invited  us to speak at a meeting for the promotion of vegetarianism. I had  ascertained that it was not considered incorrect to read one's speech. I  knew that many did so to express themselves coherently and briefly. To  speak ex tempore would have  been out of the question for me. I had therefore written down my speech.  I stood up to read it, but could not. My vision became blurred and I  trembled, though the speech hardly covered a sheet of foolscap. Sjt.  Mazmudar had to read it for me. His own speech was of course excellent  and was received with applause. I was ashamed of myself and sad at heart  for my incapacity. My last effort to make a public speech in England was on the eve of my departure  for home. But this time too I only succeeded in making myself  ridiculous. I invited my vegetarian friends to dinner in the Holborn  Restaurant referred to in these chapters. 'A vegetarian dinner could be  had,' I said to myself, 'in vegetarian restaurants as a matter of  course. But why should it not be possible in a non-vegetarian restaurant  too?' And I arranged with the manager of the Holborn Restaurant to  provide a strictly vegetarian meal. The vegetarians hailed the new  experiment with delight. All dinners are meant for enjoyment, but the  West has developed the thing into an art. They are celebrated with great \u00e9clat, music and speeches. And the little dinner party that I gave was also not  unaccompanied by some such display. Speeches, therefore, there had to  be. When my turn for speaking came, I stood up to make a speech. I had  with great care thought out one which would consist of a very few  sentences. But I could not proceed beyond the first sentence. I had read  of Addison that he began his maiden speech in the House of Commons,  repeating 'I conceive' three times, and when he could proceed no  further, a wag stood up and said, 'The gentleman conceived thrice but  brought forth nothing.' I had thought of making a humorous speech taking  this anecdote as the text. I therefore began with it and stuck there. My  memory entirely failed me and in attempting a humorous speech I made  myself ridiculous. I thank you, gentlemen, for having kindly responded  to my invitation,' I said abruptly, and sat down. It was only in South Africa that I got over this shyness, though I never completely  overcame it. It was impossible for me to speak impromptu.  I hesitated whenever I had to face strange audiences and avoided making  a speech whenever I could. Even today I do not think I could or would  even be inclined to keep a meeting of friends engaged in idle talk. I must say that, beyond occasionally exposing me to laughter, my  constitutional shyness has been no disadvantage whatever. In fact I can  see that, on the contrary, it has been all to my advantage. My hesitancy  in speech, which was once an annoyance, is now a pleasure. Its greatest  benefit has been that it has taught me the economy of words. I have  naturally formed the habit of restraining my thoughts. And I can now  give myself the certificate that a thoughtless word hardly ever escapes  my tongue or pen. I do not recollect ever having had to regret anything  in my speech or writing. I have thus been spared many a mishap and waste  of time. Experience has taught me that silence is part of the spiritual  discipline of a votary of truth. Proneness to exaggerate, to suppress or  modify the truth, wittingly or unwittingly, is a natural weakness of  man, and silence is necessary in order to surmount it. A man of few  words will rarely be thoughtless in his speech; he will measure every  word. We find so many people impatient to talk. There is no chairman of  a meeting who is not pestered with notes for permission to speak. And  whenever the permission is given the speaker generally exceeds the  time-limit, asks for more time, and keeps on talking without permission.  All this talking can hardly be said to be of any benefit to the world.  It is so much waste of time. My shyness has been in reality my shield  and buckler. It has allowed me to grow. It has helped me in my  discernment of truth. As I searched myself deeper, the necessity for changes both internal and  external began to grow on me. As soon as, or even before, I made  alterations in my expenses and my way of living, I began to make changes  in my diet. I saw that the writers on vegetarianism had examined the  question very minutely, attacking it in its religious, scientific,  practical and medical aspects. Ethically they had arrived at the  conclusion that man's supremacy over the lower animals meant not that  the former should prey upon the latter, but that the higher should  protect the lower, and that there should be mutual aid between the two  as between man and man. They had also brought out the truth that man  eats not for enjoyment but to live. And some of them accordingly  suggested and effected in their lives abstention not only from  flesh-meat but from eggs and milk. Scientifically some had concluded  that man's physical structure showed that he was not meant to be a  cooking but a frugivorous animal, that he could take only his mother's  milk and, as soon as he had teeth, should begin to take solid foods.  Medically they had suggested the rejection of all spices and condiments.  According to the practical and economic argument they had demonstrated  that a vegetarian diet was the least expensive. All these considerations  had their effect on me, and I came across vegetarians of all these types  in vegetarian restaurants. There was a Vegetarian Society in England  with a weekly journal of its own. I subscribed to the weekly, joined the  society and very shortly found myself on the Executive Committee. Here I  came in contact with those who were regarded as pillars of  vegetarianism, and began my own experiments in dietetics. I stopped taking the sweets and condiments I had got from home. The mind having  taken a different turn, the fondness for condiments wore away, and I now  relished the boiled spinach which in Richmond tasted insipid, cooked  without condiments. Many such experiments taught me that the real seat  of taste was not the tongue but the mind. The economic consideration was of course constantly before me. There was in those  days a body of opinion which regarded tea and coffee as harmful and  favoured cocoa. And as I was convinced that one should eat only articles  that sustained the body, I gave up tea and coffee as a rule, and  substituted cocoa. There were two divisions in the restaurants I used to visit. One division, which  was patronized by fairly well-to-do people, provided any number of  courses from which one chose and paid for a la carte,  each dinner thus costing from one to two shillings. The other division  provided six-penny dinners of three courses with a slice of bread. In my  days of strict frugality I usually dined in the second division. There were many minor experiments going on along with the main one; as for example,  giving up starchy foods at one time, living on bread and fruit alone at  another, and once living on cheese, milk and eggs. This last experiments  is worth noting. It lasted not even a fortnight. The reformer who  advocated starchless food had spoken highly of eggs and held that eggs  were not meat. It was apparent that there was no injury done to living  creatures in taking eggs. I was taken in by this plea and took eggs in  spite of my vow. But the lapse was momentary. I had no business to put a  new interpretation on the vow. The interpretation of my mother who  administered the vow was there for me. I knew that her definition of  meat included eggs. And as soon as I saw the true import of the vow I  gave up eggs and the experiment alike. There is a nice point underlying the argument, and worth noting. I came across  three definitions of meat in England. According to the first, meat  denoted only the flesh of birds and beasts. Vegetarians who accepted  that definition abjured the flesh of birds and beasts, but ate fish, not  to mention eggs. According to the second definition, meat meant flesh of  all living creatures. So fish was here out of the question, but eggs  were allowed. The third definition included under meat the flesh of  living beings, as well as all their products, thus covering eggs and  milk alike. If I accepted the first definition, I could take not only  eggs, but fish also. But I was convinced that my mother's definition was  the definition binding on me. If, therefore, I would observe the vow I  had taken, I must abjure eggs. I therefore did so. This was a hardship  inasmuch as inquiry showed that even in vegetarian restaurants many  courses used to contain eggs. This meant that unless I knew what was  what, I had to go through the awkward process of ascertaining whether a  particular course contained eggs or no, for many puddings and cakes were  not free from them. But though the revelation of my duty caused this  difficulty, it simplified my food. The simplification in its turn  brought me annoyance in that I had to give up several dishes I had come  to relish. These difficulties were only passing, for the strict  observance of the vow produced an inward relish distinctly more healthy,  delicate and permanent. The real ordeal, however, was still to come, and that was in respect of the other  vow. But who dare harm whom God protects? A few observations about the interpretation of vows or pledges may not be out  of place here. Interpretation of pledges has been a fruitful source of  strife all the world over. No matter how explicit the pledge, people  will turn and twist the text to suit their own purposes. They are to be  met with among all classes of society, from the rich down to the poor,  from the prince down to the peasant. Selfishness turns them blind, and  by a use of the ambiguous middle they deceive themselves and seek to  deceive the world and God. One golden rule is to accept the  interpretation honestly put on the pledge by the party administering it.  Another is to accept the interpretation of the weaker party, where there  are two interpretations possible. Rejection of these two rules gives  rise to strife and iniquity, which are rooted in untruthfulness. He who  seeks truth alone easily follows the golden rule. He need not seek  learned advice for interpretation. My mother's interpretation of meat  was, according to the golden rule, the only true one for me, and not the  one my wider experience or my pride of better knowledge might have  taught me. My experiments in England were conducted from the point of view of economy  and hygiene. The religious aspect of the question was not considered  until I went to South Africa where I undertook strenuous experiments  which will be narrated later. The seed, however, for all of them was  sown in England. A convert's enthusiasm for his new religion is greater than that of a  person who is born in it. Vegetarianism was then a new cult in England,  and likewise for me, because, as we have seen, I had gone there a  convinced meat-eater, and was intellectually converted to vegetarianism  later. Full of the neophyte's zeal for vegetarianism, I decided to start  a vegetarian club in my locality, Bayswater. I invited Sir Edwin Arnold,  who lived there, to be Vice-President. Dr. Oldfield who was Editor of  the The Vegetarian became President. I myself became the Secretary. The club went well for  a while, but came to an end in the course of a few months. For I left  the locality, according to my custom of moving from place to place  periodically. But this brief and modest experience gave me some little  training in organizing and conducting institutions. Towards the end of my second year in England I came across two Theosophists,  brothers, and both unmarried. They talked to me about the Gita  They were reading Sir Edwin Arnold's translation \u2013 The Song Celestial \u2013 and  they invited me to read the original with them. I felt ashamed, as I  had read the divine poem neither in Samskrit nor in Gujarati. I was  constrained to tell them that I had not read the Gita,  but that I would gladly read it with them, and that though my  knowledge of Samskrit was meagre, still I hoped to be able to  understand the original to the extent of telling where the  translation failed to bring out the meaning. I began reading the Gita with them. The verses in the second chapter. There were comparatively few Indian students in England forty years ago.  It was a practice with them to affect the bachelor even though they  might be married. School or college students in England are all  bachelors, studies being regarded as incompatible with married life.  We had that tradition in the good old days, a student then being  invariably known as a brahmachari.  But in these days we have child- marriages, a thing practically  unknown in England. Indian youths in England, therefore, felt  ashamed to confess that they were married. There was also another  reason for dissembling, namely that in the event of the fact being  known it would be impossible for the young men to go about or flirt  with the young girls of the family in which they lived. The flirting  was more or less innocent. Parents even encouraged it; and that sort  of association between young men and young women may even be a  necessity there, in view of the fact that every young man has to  choose his mate. If, however, Indian youths on arrival in England  indulge in these relations, quite natural to English youths, the  result is likely to be disastrous, as has often been found. I saw  that our youths had succumbed to the temptation and chosen a life of  untruth for the sake of companionships which, however innocent in  the case of English youths, were for them undesirable. I too caught  the contagion. I did not hesitate to pass myself off as a bachelor  though I was married and the father of a son. But I was none the  happier for being a dissembler. Only my reserve and my reticence  saved me from going into deeper waters. If I did not talk, no girl  would think it worth her while to enter into conversation with me or  to go out with me. My cowardice was on a par with my reserve. It was customary in families  like the one in which I was staying at Ventnor for the daughter of  the landlady to take out guests for a walk. My landlady's daughter  took me one day to the lovely hills round Ventnor. I was no slow  walker, but my companion walked even faster, dragging me after her  and chattering away all the while. I responded to her chatter  sometimes with a whispered 'yes' or 'no', or at the most 'yes, how  beautiful!' She was flying like a bird whilst I was wondering when I  should get back home. We thus reached the top of a hill. How to get  down again was the question. In spite of her high-heeled boots this  sprightly young lady of twenty-five darted down the hill like an  arrow. I was shamefacedly struggling to get down. She stood at the  foot smiling and cheering me and offering to come and drag me. How  could I be so chicken hearted? With the greatest difficulty, and  crawling at intervals, I somehow managed to scramble to the bottom.  She loudly laughed 'bravo' and shamed me all the more, as well she  might. But I could not escape scatheless everywhere. For God wanted to rid me of  the canker of untruth. I once went to Brighton, another  watering-place like Ventnor. This was before the Ventnor visit. I  met there at a hotel an old widow of moderate means. This was my  first year in England. The courses on the menu were all  described in French, which I did not understand. I sat at the same  table as the old lady. She saw that I was a stranger and puzzled,  and immediately came to my aid. 'You seem to be a stranger,' she  said, 'and look perplexed. Why have you not ordered anything?' I was  spelling through the menu and  preparing to ascertain the ingredients of the courses from the  waiter, when the good lady thus intervened. I thanked her, and  explaining my difficulty told her that I was at a loss to know which  of the courses were vegetarian as I did not understand French. 'Let me help you,' she said. 'I shall explain the card to you and show you  what you may eat.' I gratefully availed myself of her help. This was  the beginning of an acquaintance that ripened into friendship and  was kept up all through my stay in England and long after. She gave  me her London address and invited me to dine at her house every  Sunday. On special occasions also she would invite me, help me to  conquer my bashfulness and introduce me to young ladies and draw me  into conversation with them. Particularly marked out for these  conversations was a young lady who stayed with her, and often we  would be left entirely alone together. I found all this very trying at first. I could not start a conversation nor  could I indulge in any jokes. But she put me in the way. I began to  learn; and in course of time looked forward to every Sunday and came  to like the conversations with the young friend. The old lady went on spreading her net wider every day. She felt interested  in our meetings. Possibly she had her own plans about us. I was in a quandary. 'How I wished I had told the good lady that I was  married!' I said to myself. 'She would then have not thought of an  engagement between us. It is, however, never too late to mend. If I  declare the truth, I might yet be saved more misery.' With these  thoughts in my mind, I wrote a letter to her somewhat to this  effect: Ever since we met at Brighton you have been kind to me. You have taken  care of me even as a mother of her son. You also think that I should  get married and with that view you have been introducing me to young  ladies. Rather than allow matters to go further, I must confess to  you that I have been unworthy of your affection. I should have told  you when I began my visits to you that I was married. I knew that  Indian students in England dissembled the fact of their marriage and  I followed suit. I now see that I should not have done so. I must  also add that I was married while yet a boy, and am the father of a  son. I am pained that I should have kept this knowledge from you so  long. But I am glad God has now given me the courage to speak out  the truth. Will you forgive me? I assure you I have taken no  improper liberties with the young lady you were good enough to  introduce to me. I knew my limits. You, not knowing that I was  married, naturally desired that we should be engaged. In order that  things should not go beyond the present stage, I must tell you the  truth. 'If on receipt of this, you feel that I have been unworthy of your  hospitality, I assure you I shall not take it amiss. You have laid  me under an everlasting debt of gratitude by your kindness and  solicitude. If, after this, you do not reject me but continue to  regard me as worthy of your hospitality , which I will spare no  pains to deserve, I shall naturally be happy and count it a further  token of your kindness.' Let the reader know that I could not have written such a letter in a moment.  I must have drafted and redrafted it many times over. But it lifted  a burden that was weighing me down. Almost by return post came her  reply somewhat as follows: 'I have your frank letter. We were both very glad and had a hearty laugh  over it. The untruth you say you have been guilty of is pardonable.  But it is well that you have acquainted us with the real state of  things. My invitation still stands and we shall certainly expect you  next Sunday and look forward to hearing all about your  child-marriage and to the pleasure of laughing at your expense. Need  I assure you that our friendship is not in the least affected by  this incident?' I thus purged myself of the canker of untruth, and I never thenceforward  hesitated to talk of my married state wherever necessary. Distinction between the legal practice in Natal and that in the  Transvaal was that in Natal there was a joint bar; a barrister,  whilst he was admitted to the rank of advocate, could also practise  as an attorney; whereas in the Transvaal, as in Bombay, the spheres  of attorneys and advocates were distinct. A barrister had the right  of election whether he would practise as an advocate or as an  attorney. So whilst in Natal I was admitted as an advocate, in the  Transvaal I sought admission as an attorney. For as an advocate I  could not have come in direct contact with the Indians and the white  attorneys in South Africa would not have briefed me.  But even in the Transvaal it was open to attorneys to appear before  magistrates. On one occasion, whilst I was conducting a case before  a magistrate in Johannesburg, I discovered that my client had  deceived me. I saw him completely break down in the witness box. So  without any argument I asked the magistrate to dismiss the case. The  opposing counsel was astonished, and the magistrate was pleased. I  rebuked my client for bringing a false case to me. He knew that I  never accepted false cases, and when I brought the thing home to  him, he admitted his mistake, and I have an impression that he was  not angry with me for having asked the magistrate to decide against  him. At any rate my conduct in this case did not affect my practice  for the worse, indeed it made my work easier. I also saw that my  devotion to truth enhanced my reputation amongst the members of the  profession, and in spite of the handicap of colour I was able in  some cases to win even their affection.  During my professional work it was also my habit never to conceal my  ignorance from my clients or my colleagues. Wherever I felt myself  at sea, I would advise my client to consult some other counsel, or  if he preferred to stick to me, I would ask him to let me seek the  assistance of senior counsel. This frankness earned me the unbounded  affection and trust of my clients. They were always willing to pay  the fee whenever consultation with senior counsel was necessary.  This affection and trust served me in good stead in my public work.  I have indicated in the foregoing chapters that my object in  practising in South Africa was service of the community. Even for  this purpose, winning the confidence of the people was an  indispensable condition. The large-hearted Indians magnified into  service professional work done for money, and when I advised them to  suffer the hardships of imprisonment for the sake of their rights,  many of them cheerfully accepted the advice, not so much because  they had reasoned out the correctness of the course, as because of  their confidence in, and affection for, me.  As I write this, many a sweet reminiscence comes to my mind.  Hundreds of clients became friends and real co-workers in public  service, and their association sweetened a life that was otherwise  full of difficulties and dangers.  The reader, by now, will be quite familiar with Parsi Rustomji's name.  He was one who became at once my client and co-worker, or perhaps it  would be truer to say that he first became co-worker and then  client. I won his confidence to such an extent that he sought and  followed my advice also in private domestic matters. Even when he  was ill, he would seek my aid, and though there was much difference  between our ways of living, he did not hesitate to accept my quack  treatment.  This friend once got into a very bad scrape. Though he kept me  informed of most of his affairs, he had studiously kept back one  thing. He was a large importer of goods from Bombay and Calcutta,  and not infrequently he resorted to smuggling. But as he was on the  best terms with customs officials, no one was inclined to suspect  him. In charging duty, they used to take his invoices on trust. Some  might even have connived at the smuggling.  But to use the telling simile of the Gujarati poet Akho, theft like  quicksilver won't be suppressed, and Parsi Rustomji's proved no  exception. The good friend ran post haste to me, the tears rolling  down his cheeks as he said: 'Bhai, I have deceived you. My guilt has  been discovered today. I have smuggled and I am doomed. I must go to  jail and be ruined. You alone may be able to save me from this  predicament. I have kept back nothing else from you, but I thought I  ought not to bother you with such tricks of the trade, and so I  never told you about this smuggling. But now, how much I repent it!' I calmed him and said: 'To save or not to save you is in His hands.  As to me you know my way. I can but try to save you by means of  confession.'  The good Parsi felt deeply mortified.  'But is not my confession before you enough?' he asked. 'You have wronged not me but Government. How will the confession  made before me avail you?' I replied gently.  'Of course I will do just as you advise, but will you not consult  with my old counsel Mr. _____? He is a friend too,' said Parsi  Rustomji.  Inquiry revealed that the smuggling had been going on for a long  time, but the actual offence detected involved a trifling sum. We  went to his counsel. He perused the papers, and said: 'The case will  be tried by a jury, and a Natal jury will be the last to acquit an  Indian. But I will not give up hope.'  I did not know this counsel intimately. Parsi Rustomji intercepted:  'I thank you, but I should like to be guided by Mr. Gandhi's advice  in this case. He knows me intimately. Of course you will advise him  whenever necessary.'  Having thus shelved the counsel's question, we went to Parsi  Rustomji's shop.  And now explaining my view I said to him: 'I don't think this case  should be taken to court at all. It rests with the Customs Officer  to prosecute you or to let you go, and he in turn will have to be  guided by the Attorney General. I am prepared to meet both. I  propose that you should offer to pay the penalty they fix, and the  odds are that they will be agreeable. But if they are not, you must  be prepared to go to jail. I am of opinion that the shame lies not  so much in going to jail as in committing the offence. The deed of  shame has already been done. Imprisonment you should regard as a  penance. The real penance lies in resolving never to smuggle again.' I cannot say that Parsi Rustomji took all this quite well. He was a  brave man, but his courage failed him for the moment. His name and  fame were at stake, and where would he be if the edifice he had  reared with such care and labour should go to pieces?  'Well, I have told you,' he said, 'that I am entirely in your hands.  You may do just as you like.'  I brought to bear on this case all my powers of persuasion. I met  the Customs Officer and fearlessly apprised him of the whole affair.  I also promised to place all the books at his disposal and told him  how penitent Parsi Rustomji was feeling. The Customs Officer said: 'I  like the old Parsi. I am sorry he has made a fool of himself. You  know where my duty lies. I must be guided by the Attorney General  and so I would advise you to use all your persuasion with him.' 'I shall be thankful,' said I, 'if you do not insist on dragging him  into court.'  Having got him to promise this, I entered into correspondence with  the Attorney General and also met him. I am glad to say that he  appreciated my complete frankness and was convinced that I had kept  back nothing.  I now forget whether it was in connection with this or with some  other case that my persistence and frankness extorted from him the  remark: 'I see you will never take a no for an answer.' The case against Parsi Rustomji was compromised. He was to pay a  penalty equal to twice the amount he had confessed to having  smuggled. Rustomji reduced to writing the facts of the whole case,  got the paper framed and hung it up in his office to serve as a  perpetual reminder to his heirs and fellow merchants.  These friends of Rustomji warned me not to be taken in by this  transitory contrition. When I told Rustomji about this warning he  said: 'What would be my fate if I deceived you?' Before coming to a narrative of the course my life took in India, it seems  necessary to recall a few of the South African experiences which I  have deliberately left out.  Some lawyer friends have asked me to give my reminiscences of the  bar. The number of these is so large that, if I were to describe  them all, they would occupy a volume by themselves and take me out  of my scope. But it may not perhaps be improper to recall some of  those which bear upon the practice of truth.  So far as I can recollect, I have already said that I never resorted  to untruth in my profession, and that a large part of my legal  practice was in the interest of public work, for which I charged  nothing beyond out-of-pocket expenses, and these too I sometimes met  myself. I had thought that in saying this I had said all that was  necessary as regards my legal practice. But friends want me to do  more. They seem to think that, if I described however slightly, some  of the occasions when I refused to swerve from the truth, the legal  profession might profit by it.  As a student I had heard that the lawyer's profession was a liar's  profession. But this did not influence me, as I had no intention of  earning either position or money by lying.  My principle was put to the test many a time in South Africa. Often  I knew that my opponents had tutored their witnesses, and if I only  encouraged my client or his witness to lie, we could win the case.  But I always resisted the temptation. I remember only one occasion  when, after having won a case, I suspected that my client had  deceived me. In my heart of hearts I always wished that I should win  only if my client's case was right. In fixing my fees I do not  recall ever having made them conditional on my winning the case.  Whether my client won or lost, I expected nothing more nor less than  my fees.  I warned every new client at the outset that he should not expect me  to take up a false case or to coach the witnesses, with the result  that I built up such a reputation that no false cases used to come  to me. Indeed some of my clients would keep their clean cases for  me, and take the doubtful ones elsewhere.  There was one case which proved a severe trial. It was brought to me  by one of my best clients. It was a case of highly complicated  accounts and had been a prolonged one. It had been heard in parts  before several courts. Ultimately the book-keeping portion of it was  entrusted by the court to the arbitration of some qualified  accountants. The award was entirely in favour of my client, but the  arbitrators had inadvertently committed an error in calculation  which, however small, was serious, inasmuch as an entry which ought  to have been on the debit side was made on the credit side. The  opponents had opposed the award on other grounds. I was junior  counsel for my client. When the senior counsel became aware of the  error, he was of opinion that our client was not bound to admit it.  He was clearly of opinion that no counsel was bound to admit  anything that went against his client's interest. I said we ought to  admit the error.  But the senior counsel contended: 'In that case  there is every likelihood of the court canceling the whole award,  and no sane counsel would imperil his client's case to that extent.  At any rate I would be the last man to take any such risk. If the  case were to be sent up for a fresh hearing, one could never tell  what expenses our client might have to incur, and what the ultimate  result might be!'  The client was present when this conversation took place. I said: 'I feel that both our client and we ought to run the risk.  Where is the certainty of the court upholding a wrong award simply  because we do not admit the error? And supposing the admission were  to bring the client to grief, what harm is there?'  'But why should we make the admission at all?' said the senior  counsel.  'Where is the surety of the court not detecting the error or our  opponent not discovering it?' said I.  'Well then, will you argue the case? I am not prepared to argue it  on your terms,' replied the senior counsel with decision. I humbly answered: 'If you will not argue, then I am prepared to do  so, if our client so desires. I shall have nothing to do with the  case if the error is not admitted.'  With this I looked at my client. He was a little embarrassed. I had  been in the case from the very first. The client fully trusted me,  and knew me through and through. He said: 'Well, then, you will  argue the case and admit the error. Let us lose, if that is to be  our lot. God defend the right.'  I was delighted. I had expected nothing less from him. The senior  counsel again warned me, pitied me for my obduracy, but  congratulated me all the same.  What happened in the court we shall see in the next chapter.  I had no doubt about the soundness of my advice, but I doubted very  much my fitness for doing full justice to the case. I felt it would  be a most hazardous undertaking to argue such a difficult case  before the Supreme Court, and I appeared before the Bench in fear  and trembling.  As soon as I referred to the error in the accounts, one of the  judges said:  'Is not this sharp practice, Mr. Gandhi?'  I boiled within to hear this charge. It was intolerable to be accused of sharp practice when  there was not the slightest warrant for it.  'With a judge prejudiced from the start like this, there is little  chance of success in this difficult case,' I said to myself. But I  composed my thoughts and answered:  'I am surprised that your Lordship should suspect sharp practice without hearing me out.' 'No question of a charge,' said the judge. 'It is a mere suggestion.'  'The suggestion here seems to me to amount to a charge. I would ask  your Lordship to hear me out and then arraign me if there is any occasion for it.'  'I am sorry to have interrupted you,' replied the judge. 'Pray do go  on with your explanation of the discrepancy.'  I had enough material in support of my explanation. Thanks to the  judge having raised this question, I was able to rivet the Court's  attention on my argument from the very start. I felt much encouraged  and took the opportunity of entering into a detailed explanation.  The Court gave me a patient hearing, and I was able to convince the  judges that the discrepancy was due entirely to inadvertence. They  therefore did not feel disposed to cancel the whole award, which had  involved considerable labour.  The opposing counsel seemed to feel secure in the belief that not  much argument would be needed after the error had been admitted. But  the judges continued to interrupt him, as they were convinced that  the error was a slip which could easily be rectified. The counsel  laboured hard to attack the award, but the judge who had originally  started with the suspicion had now come round definitely to my side. 'Supposing Mr. Gandhi had not admitted the error, what would you  have done?' he asked.  'It was impossible for us to secure the services of a more competent  and honest expert accountant than the one appointed by us.' 'The Court must presume that you know your case best. If you cannot  point out anything beyond the slip which any expert accountant is  liable to commit, the Court will be loath to compel the parties to  go in for fresh litigation and fresh expenses because of a patent  mistake. We may not order a fresh hearing when such an error can be  easily corrected,' continued the judge.  And so the counsel's objection was overruled. The Court either  confirmed the award, with the error rectified, or ordered the  arbitrator to rectify the error, I forget which.  I was delighted. So were my client and senior counsel; and I was  confirmed in my conviction that it was not impossible to practise  law without compromising truth.  Let the reader, however, remember that even truthfulness in the  practice of the profession cannot cure it of the fundamental defect  that vitiates it.  The persistence of the pleurisy caused some anxiety,  but I knew that the cure lay not in taking medicine internally but in dietetic  changes assisted by external remedies.  I called in Dr. Allinson of vegetarian fame, who treated diseases by  dietetic modifications and whom I had met in . He thoroughly  overhauled me. I explained to him how I had pledged myself not to  take milk. He cheered me up and said: 'You need not take milk. In  fact I want you to do without any fat for some days.' He then  advised me to live on plain brown bread, raw vegetables such as  beet, radish, onion and other tubers and greens, and also fresh  fruit, mainly oranges. The vegetables were not to be cooked but  merely grated fine, if I could not masticate them.  I adopted this for about three days, but raw vegetables did not  quite suit me. My body was not in a condition to enable me to do  full justice to the experiment. I was nervous about taking raw  vegetables.  Dr. Allinson also advised me to keep all the windows of my room open  for the whole twenty-four hours, bathe in tepid water, have an oil  massage on the affected parts and a walk in the open for fifteen to  thirty minutes. I liked all these suggestions.  My room had French windows which, if kept wide open, would let in  the rain. The fanlight could not be opened. I therefore got the  glass broken, so as to let in fresh air, and I partially opened the  windows in a manner not to let in rain.  All these measures somewhat improved my health, but did not  completely cure me.  Lady Cecilia Roberts occasionally called on me. We became friends.  She wanted very much to persuade me to take milk. But as I was  unyielding, she hunted about for a substitute for milk. Some friend  suggested to her malted milk, assuring her quite unknowingly that it  was absolutely free from milk, and that it was a chemical  preparation with all the properties of milk. Lady Cecilia, I knew,  had a great regard for my religious scruples, and so I implicitly  trusted her. I dissolved the powder in water and took it only to  find that it tasted just like milk. I read the label on the bottle,  to find, only too late, that it was a preparation of milk. So I gave  it up.  I informed Lady Cecilia about the discovery, asking her not to worry  over it. She came post haste to me to say how sorry she was. Her  friend had not read the label at all. I begged her not to be anxious  and expressed my regret that I could not avail myself of the thing  she had procured with so much trouble. I also assured her that I did  not at all feel upset or guilty over having taken milk under a  misapprehension.  I must skip over many other sweet reminiscences of my contact with  Lady Cecilia. I could think of many friends who have been a source  of great comfort to me in the midst of trials and disappointments.  One who has faith reads in them the merciful providence of God, who  thus sweetens sorrow itself.  Dr. Allinson, when he next called, relaxed his restrictions and permitted me to have groundnut butter  or olive oil for the sake of fat, and to take the vegetables cooked,  if I chose, with rice. These changes were quite welcome, but they  were far from giving me a complete cure. Very careful nursing was  still necessary, and I was obliged to keep mostly in bed.  Dr. Mehta occasionally looked in to examine me and held out a  standing offer to cure me if only I would listen to his advice. Whilst things were going on in this way, Mr. Roberts one day came to  see me and urged me very strongly to go home. 'You cannot possibly  go to Netley in this condition. There is still severer cold ahead of  us. I would strongly advise you to get back to India, for it is only  there that you can be completely cured. If, after your recovery, you  should find the war still going on, you will have many opportunities  there of rendering help. As it is, I do not regard what you have  already done as by any means a mean contribution.'  I accepted his advice and began to make preparations for returning to India.  Mr. Kallenbach had accompanied me to England with a view to going to  India. We were staying together and of course wanted to sail by the  same boat. Germans, however, were under such strict surveillance  that we had our doubts about Mr. Kallenbach getting a passport. I  did my best to get it, and Mr. Roberts, who was in favour of his  getting his passport, sent a cable to the Viceroy in this behalf.  But straight came Lord Hardinge's reply: 'Regret Government of India  not prepared to take any such risk.' All of us understood the force  of the reply.  It was a great wrench for me to part from Mr. Kallenbach, but I  could see that his pang was greater. Could he have come to India, he  would have been leading today the simple happy life of a farmer and  weaver. Now he is in South Africa, leading his old life and doing  brisk business as an architect.  We wanted a third class passage, but as there was none available on  P. & O. boats, we had to go second.  We took with us the dried fruit we had carried from South Africa, as  most of it would not be procurable on the boat, where fresh fruit  was easily available.  Dr. Jivraj Mehta had bandaged my ribs with 'Mede's Plaster' and had  asked me not to remove it till we reached the Red Sea. For two days  I put up with the discomfort, but finally it became too much for me.  It was with considerable difficulty that I managed to undo the  plaster and regain the liberty of having a proper wash and bath.  My diet consisted mostly of nuts and fruits. I found that I was  improving every day and felt very much better by the time we entered  the Suez Canal. I was weak, but felt entirely out of danger, and I  gradually went on increasing my exercise. The improvement I  attributed largely to the pure air of the temperate zone. Whether it was due to past experience or to any other reason, I do  not know, but the kind of distance I noticed between the English and  Indian passengers on the boat was something I had not observed even  on my voyage from South Africa. I did talk to a few Englishmen, but  the talk was mostly formal. There were hardly any cordial  conversations such as had certainly taken place on the South African  boats. The reason for this was, I think, to be found in the  conscious or unconscious feeling at the back of the Englishman's  mind that he belonged to the ruling race, and the feeling at the  back of the Indian's mind that he belonged to the subject race. I was eager to reach home and get free from this atmosphere. On arriving at Aden we already began to feel somewhat at home. We  knew the Adenwallas very well, having met Mr. Kekobad Kavasji  Dinshaw in Durban and come in close contact with him and his wife. A few days more and we reached Bombay. It was such a joy to get back  to the homeland after an exile of ten years.  Gokhale had inspired a reception for me in Bombay, where he had come in spite of his  delicate health. I had approached India in the ardent hope of  merging myself in him, and thereby feeling free. But fate had willed  it otherwise.  Though I thus took part in the war as a matter of duty, it chanced that I  was not only unable directly to participate in it, but actually  compelled to offer what may be called miniature Satyagraha even at  that critical juncture.  I have already said that an officer was appointed in charge of our  training, as soon as our names were approved and enlisted. We were  all under the impression that this Commanding Officer was to be our  chief only so far as technical matters were concerned, and that in  all other matters I was the head of our Corps, which was directly  responsible to me in matters of internal discipline; that is to say,  the Commanding Officer had to deal with the Corps through me. But  from the first the Officer left us under no such delusion. Mr. Sorabji Adajania was a shrewd man. He warned me. 'Beware of this  man,' he said. 'He seems inclined to lord it over us. We will have  none of his orders. We are prepared to look upon him as our  instructor. But the youngsters he has appointed to instruct us also  feel as though they had come as our masters.'  These youngsters were Oxford students who had come to instruct us  and whom the Commanding Officer had appointed to be our section  leaders.  I also had not failed to notice the high-handedness of the  Commanding Officer, but I asked Sorabji not to be anxious and tried  to pacify him. But he was not the man to be easily convinced. 'You are too trusting. Those people will deceive you with wretched  words, and when at last you see through them, you will ask us to  resort to Satyagraha, and so come to grief, and bring us all to  grief along with you,' said he with a smile.  'What else but grief can you hope to come to after having cast in  your lot with me?' said I. 'A Satyagrahi is born to be deceived. Let  the Commanding Officer deceive us. Have I not told you times without  number that ultimately a deceiver only deceives himself?' Sorabji gave a loud laugh. 'Well, then,' said he, 'continue to be  deceived. You will some day meet your death in Satyagraha and drag  poor mortals like me behind you.'  These words put me in mind of what  the late Miss Emily Hobhouse wrote to me with regard to  non-co-operation: 'I should not be surprised if one of these days  you have to go to the gallows for the sake of truth. May God show  you the right path and protect you.'  The talk with Sorabji took place just after the appointment of the  Commanding Officer. In a very few days our relations with him  reached the breaking-point. I had hardly regained my strength after  the fourteen days' fast, when I began to take part in the drill,  often walking to the appointed place about two miles from home. This  gave me pleurisy and laid me low. In this condition I had to go  week-end camping. Whilst the others stayed there, I returned home.  It was here that an occasion arose for Satyagraha. The Commanding Officer began to exercise his authority somewhat  freely. He gave us clearly to understand that he was our head in all  matters, military and non-military, giving us at the same time a  taste of his authority. Sorabji hurried to me. He was not at all  prepared to put up with this high-handedness. He said: 'We must have  all orders through you. We are still in the training camp and all  sorts of absurd orders are being issued. Invidious distinctions are  made between ourselves and those youths who have been appointed to  instruct us. We must have it out with the Commanding Officer,  otherwise we shall not be able to go on any longer. The Indian  students and others who have joined our Corps are not going to abide  by any absurd orders. In a cause which has been taken up for the  sake of self-respect, it is unthinkable to put up with loss of it.' I approached the Commanding Officer and drew his attention to the  complaints I had received. He wrote asking me to set out the  complaints in writing, at the same time asking me 'to impress upon  those who complain that the proper direction in which to make  complaints is to me through their section commanders, now appointed,  who will inform me through the instructors.'  To this I replied saying that I claimed no authority, that in the  military sense I was no more than any other private, but that I had  believed that as Chairman of the Volunteer Corps, I should be  allowed unofficially to act as their representative. I also set out  the grievances and requests that had been brought to my notice,  namely, that grievous dissatisfaction had been caused by the  appointment of section leaders without reference to the feeling of  the members of the Corps; that they be recalled, and the Corps be  invited to elect section leaders, subject to the Commander's  approval.  This did not appeal to the Commanding Officer, who said it  was repugnant to all military discipline that the section leaders  should be elected by the Corps, and that the recall of appointments  already made would be subversive of all discipline.  So we held a meeting and decided upon withdrawal. I brought home to  the members the serious consequences of Satyagraha. But a very large  majority voted for the resolution, which was to the effect that,  unless the appointments of Corporals already made were recalled and  the members of the Corps given an opportunity of electing their own  Corporals, the members would be obliged to abstain from further  drilling and week-end camping.  I then addressed a letter to the Commanding Officer telling him what  a severe disappointment his letter rejecting my suggestion had been.  I assured him that I was not fond of any exercise of authority and  that I was most anxious to serve. I also drew his  attention to a precedent. I pointed out that, although I occupied no  official rank in the South African Indian Ambulance Corps at the  time of the Boer War, there was never a hitch between Colonel Gallwey  and the Corps, and the Colonel never took a step without  reference to me with a view to ascertain the wishes of the Corps. I  also enclosed a copy of the resolution we had passed the previous  evening.  This had no good effect on the Officer, who felt that the meeting  and the resolution were a grave breach of discipline.  Hereupon I addressed a letter to the Secretary of State for India, acquainting  him with all the facts and enclosing a copy of the resolution. He  replied explaining that conditions in South Africa were different,  and drawing my attentions to the fact that under the rules the  section commanders were appointed by the Commanding Officer, but  assuring me that in future, when appointing section commanders, the  Commanding Officer would consider my recommendations.  A good deal of correspondence passed between us after this, but I do  not want to prolong the bitter tale. Suffice it to say that my  experience was of a piece with the experiences we daily have in  India. What with threats and what with adroitness the Commanding  Officer succeeded in creating a division in our Corps. Some of those  who had voted for the resolution yielded to the Commander's threats  or persuasions and went back on their promise.  About this time an unexpectedly large contingent of wounded soldiers  arrived at the Netley Hospital, and the services of our Corps were  requisitioned. Those whom the Commanding Officer could persuade went  to Netley. The others refused to go. I was on my back, but was in  communication with the members of the Corps. Mr. Roberts, the  Under-Secretary of State, honoured me with many calls during those days.  He insisted on my persuading the others to serve. He suggested that  they should form a separate Corps and that at the Netley Hospital  they could be responsible only to the Commanding Officer there, so  that there would be no question of loss of self-respect, Government  would be placated, and at same time helpful service would be  rendered to the large number of wounded received at the hospital.  This suggestion appealed both to my companions and to me, with the  result that those who had stayed away also went to Netley. Only I remained away, lying on my back and making the best of a bad  job.  I have already referred to the attack of pleurisy I had in England.  Gokhale returned to London soon after. Kallenbach and I used  regularly to go to him. Our talks were mostly about the war, and as  Kallenbach had the geography of Germany at his finger tips, and had  travelled much in Europe, he used to show him on the map the various  places in connection with the war.  When I got pleurisy this also became a topic of daily discussion. My  dietetic experiments were going on even then. My diet consisted,  among other things, of groundnuts, ripe and unripe bananas, lemon,  olive oil, tomatoes and grapes. I completely eschewed milk, cereals,  pulses and other things.  Dr. Jivraj Mehta treated me. He pressed me hard to resume milk and  cereals, but I was obdurate. The matter reached Gokhale's ears. He  had not much regard for my reasoning in favour of a fruitarian diet,  and he wanted me to take whatever the doctor prescribed for my  health.  It was no easy thing for me not a yield to Gokhale's pressure. When  he would not take a refusal, I begged him to give me twenty-four  hours for thinking over the question. As Kallenbach and I returned  home that evening, we discussed where my duty lay. He had been with  me in my experiment. He liked it, but I saw that he was agreeable to  my giving it up if my health demanded it. So I had to decide for  myself according to the dictates of the inner voice.  I spent the  whole night thinking over the matter. To give up the experiment  would mean renouncing all my ideas in that direction, and yet I  found no flaw in them. The question was how far I should yield to  Gokhale's loving pressure, and how far I might modify my experiment  in the so-called interests of health. I finally decided to adhere to  the experiment in so far as the motive behind was chiefly religious,  and to yield to the doctor's advice where the motive was mixed.  Religious considerations had been predominant in the giving up of  milk. I had before me a picture of the wicked processes the govals  in Calcutta adopted to extract the last drop of milk from their cows  and buffaloes. I also had the feeling that, just as meat was not  man's food, even so animal's milk could not be man's food. So I got  up in the morning with the determination to adhere to my resolve to  abstain from milk. This greatly relieved me. I dreaded to approach  Gokhale, but I trusted him to respect my decision.  In the evening Kallenbach and I called on Gokhale at the National  Liberal Club. The first question he asked me was: 'Well, have you  decided to accept the doctor's advice?'  I gently but firmly replied: 'I am willing to yield on all points  except one about which I beg you not to press me. I will not take  milk, milk-products or meat. If not to take these things should mean  my death, I feel I had better face it.'  'Is this your final decision?' asked Gokhale.  'I am afraid I cannot decide otherwise,' said I. 'I know that my  decision will pain you, but I beg your forgiveness.'  With a certain amount of pain but with deep affection, Gokhale said:  'I do not approve of your decision. I do not see any religion in it.  But I won't press you any more.' With these words he turned to Dr.  Jivraj Mehta and said: 'Please don't worry him any more. Prescribe  anything you like within the limit he has set for himself.'  The doctor expressed dissent, but was helpless. He advised me to  take mung soup., with a dash of asafoetida in it. To this I agreed.  I took it for a day or two, but it increased my pain. As I did not  find it suitable, I went back to fruits and nuts. The doctor of  course went on with his external treatment. The latter somewhat  relieved my pain, but my restrictions were to him a sore handicap. Meanwhile Gokhale left for home, as he could not stand the October  fogs of London.  I have deferred saying anything up to now about the purpose for which I  went to England, viz., being called to the bar. It is time to advert to it briefly. There were two conditions which had to be fulfilled before a student was  formally called to the bar: 'keeping terms,' twelve terms equivalent  to about three years; and passing examinations. 'Keeping terms'  meant eating one's terms, i.e., attending at least six out of  about twenty-four dinners in a term. Eating did not mean actually  partaking of the dinner, it meant reporting oneself at the fixed  hours and remaining present throughout the dinner. Usually, of  course, every one ate and drank the good commons and choice wines  provided. A dinner cost from two and six to three and six, that is  from two to three rupees. This was considered moderate, inasmuch as  one had to pay that same amount for wines alone if one dined at a  hotel. To us in India it is a matter for surprise, if we are not  'civilized', that the cost of drink should exceed the cost of food.  The first revelation gave me a great shock, and I wondered how  people had the heart to throw away so much money on drink. Later I  came to understand. I often ate nothing at these dinners, for the  things that I might eat were only bread, boiled potato and cabbage.  In the beginning I did not eat these, as I did not like them; and  later, when I began to relish them, I also gained the courage to ask  for other dishes. The dinner provided for the benchers used to be better than that for the  students. A Parsi student, who was also a vegetarian, and I applied,  in the interests of vegetarianism, for the vegetarian courses which  were served to the benchers. The application was granted, and we  began to get fruits and other vegetables from the benchers' table. Two bottles of wine were allowed to each group of four, and as I did not  touch them, I was ever in demand to form a quarter, so that three  might empty two bottles. And there was a 'grand night' in each term  when extra wines, like champagne, in addition to port and sherry  were served. I was therefore specially requested to attend and was  in great demand on that grand night.I could  not see then, nor have I seen since, how these dinners qualified the  students better for the bar. There was once a time when only a few  students used to attend these dinners and thus there were  opportunities for talks between them and the benchers, and speeches  were also made. These occasions helped to give them knowledge of the  world with a sort of polish and refinement, and also improved their  power of speaking. No such thing was possible in my time, as the  benchers had a table all to themselves. The institution had  gradually lost all its meaning, but conservative England retained it  nevertheless. The curriculum of study was easy, barristers being humorously known as  'dinner barristers'. Everyone knew that the examinations had  practically no value. In my time there were two, one in Roman Law  and the other in Common Law. There were regular text-books  prescribed for these examinations which could be taken in  compartments, but scarcely any one read them. I have known many to  pass the Roman Law examination by scrambling through notes on Roman  Law in a couple of weeks, and the Common Law examination by reading  notes on the subject in two or three months. Question papers were  easy and examiners were generous. The percentage of passes in the  Roman Law examination used to be  to  and of those in the final  examination  or even more. There was thus little fear of being  plucked, and examinations were held not once but four times in the  year. They could not be felt as a difficulty. But I succeeded in turning them into one. I felt that I should read all  the text-books. It was a fraud, I thought, not to read these books.  I invested much money in them. I decided to read Roman Law in Latin.  The Latin which I had acquired in the London Matriculation stood me  in good stead. And all this reading was not without its value later  on in South Africa, where Roman Dutch is the common law. The reading  of Justinian, therefore, helped me a great deal in understanding the  South African law. It took me nine months of fairly hard labour to read through the Common Law  of England. For Broom's Common Law,  a big but interesting volume, took up a good deal of time. Snell's Equity was full of interest, but a bit hard to understand. White and Tudor's  Leading Cases, from which certain cases were prescribed, was full of interest and  instruction. I read also with interest Williams' and Edward's  Real Property, and Goodeve's Personal Property.  Williams' book read like a novel. The one book I remember to have  read, on my return to India, with the same unflagging interest, was  Mayne's Hindu Law But it is out of place to talk here of Indian law books. I passed my examinations, was called to the bar on the th of June , and  enrolled in the High Court on the th. On the th I sailed for  home. But notwithstanding my study there was no end to my helplessness and  fear. I did not feel myself qualified to practise law. But a separate chapter is needed to describe this helplessness of mine. ",
    "1893-1897": " The heart's earnest and pure desire is always fulfilled. In my own  experience I have often seen this rule verified. Service of the poor  has been my heart's desire, and it has always thrown me amongst the  poor and enabled me to identify myself with them.  Although the members of the Natal Indian Congress included the  colonial-born Indians and the clerical class, the unskilled wage-earners, the indentured labourers were still outside its pale. The Congress was not yet theirs. They could not afford to belong to it  by paying the subscription and becoming its members. The Congress  could win their attachment only by serving them. An opportunity  offered itself when neither the Congress nor I was really ready for  it. I had put in scarcely three or four month's practice, and the  Congress also was still in its infancy, when a Tamil man in tattered  clothes, head-gear in hand, two front teeth broken and his mouth  bleeding, stood before me trembling and weeping. He had been heavily belaboured by his master. I learnt all about him from my clerk, who was a Tamilian. Balasundaram - as that was the visitor's name - was  serving his indenture under a well-known European resident of  Durban. The master, getting angry with him, had lost self-control,  and had beaten Balasundaram severely, breaking two of his teeth.  I sent him to a doctor. In those days only white doctors were  available. I wanted a certificate from the doctor about the nature  of the injury Balasundaram had sustained. I secured the certificate,  and straightway took the injured man to the magistrate, to whom I  submitted his affidavit. The magistrate was indignant when he read  it and issued a summons against the employer.  It was far from my desire to get the employer punished. I simply  wanted Balasundaram to be released from him. I read the law about  indentured labour. If an ordinary servant left service without  giving notice, he was liable to be sued by his master in a civil  court. With the indentured labourer the case was entirely different.  He was liable, in similar circumstances, to be proceeded against in  a criminal court and to be imprisoned on conviction. That is why Sir  William Hunter called the indenture system almost as bad as slavery.  Like the slave the indentured labourer was the property of his  master.  There were only two ways of releasing Balasundaram: either by  getting the Protector of Indentured Labourers to cancel his  indenture or transfer him to someone else, or by getting  Balasundaram's employer to release him. I called on the latter and  said to him: 'I do not want to proceed against you and get you  punished. I think you realize that you have severely beaten the man.  I shall be satisfied if you will transfer the indenture to someone  else.' To this he readily agreed. I next saw the Protector. He also  agreed, on condition that I found a new employer.  So I went off in search of an employer. He had to be a European, as  no Indians could employ indentured labour. At that time I knew very  few Europeans. I met one of them. He very kindly agreed to take on  Balasundaram. I gratefully acknowledged his kindness. The magistrate  convicted Balasundaram's employer, and recorded that he had  undertaken to transfer the indenture to someone else.  Balasundaram's case reached the ears of every indentured labourer,  and I came to be regarded as their friend. I hailed this connection  with delight. A regular stream of indentured labourers began to pour  into my office, and I got the best opportunity of learning their  joys and sorrows.  The echoes of Balasundaram's case were heard in far off Madras.  Labourers from different parts of the province, who went to Natal on  indenture, came to know of this case through their indentured  brethren.  There was nothing extraordinary in the case itself, but the fact  that there was someone in Natal to espouse their cause and publicly  work for them gave the indentured labourer a joyful surprise and  inspired him with hope.  I have said that Balasundaram entered my office, head-gear in hand.  There was a peculiar pathos about the circumstance which also showed  our humiliation. I have already narrated the incident when I was  asked to take off my turban. A practice had been forced upon every  indentured labourer and every Indian stranger to take off his head-gear, when visiting a European, whether the head-gear were a cap, turban or a scarf wrapped round the head. A salute even with both  hands was not sufficient. Balasundaram thought that he should follow  the practice even with me. This was the first case in my experience.  I felt humiliated and asked him to tie up his scarf. He did so, not  without a certain hesitation, but I could perceive the pleasure on  his face.  It has always been a mystery to me how men can feel themselves  honoured by the humiliation of their fellow beings.  Balasundaram's case brought me into touch with the indentured Indians. What  impelled me, however, to make a deep study of their condition was  the campaign for bringing them under special heavy taxation. In the same year, , the Natal Government sought to impose an annual tax  of \u00a3 on the indentured Indians. The proposal astonished me. I put  the matter before the Congress for discussion, and it was  immediately resolved to organize the necessary opposition. At the outset I must explain briefly the genesis of the tax.  About the year  the Europeans in Natal, finding that there was  considerable scope for sugar-cane cultivation, felt themselves in  need of labour. Without outside labour the cultivation of cane and  the manufacture of sugar were impossible, as the Natal Zulus were  not suited to this form of work. The Natal Government therefore  corresponded with the Indian Government, and secured their  permission to recruit Indian labour. These recruits were to sign an  indenture to work in Natal for five years, and at the end of the  term they were to be at liberty to settle there and to have full  rights of ownership of land. Those were the inducements held out to  them for the whites then had looked forward to improving their  agriculture by the industry of the Indian labourers after the term  of their indentures had expired. But the Indians gave more than had been expected of them. They grew  large quantities of vegetables. They introduced a number of Indian  varieties and made it possible to grow the local varieties cheaper.  They also introduced the mango. Nor did their enterprise stop at  agriculture. They entered trade. They purchased land for building,  and many raised themselves from the status of labourers to that of  owners of land and houses. Merchants from India followed them and  settled there for trade. The late Sheth Abubakar Amod was first  among them. He soon built up an extensive business. The white traders were alarmed. When they first welcomed the Indian  labourers, they had not reckoned with their business skill. They  might be tolerated as independent agriculturists, but their  competition in trade could not be brooked.  This sowed the seed of the antagonism to Indians. Many other factors  contributed to its growth. Our different ways of living, our  simplicity, our contentment with small gains, our indifference to  the laws of hygiene and sanitation, our slowness in keeping our  surroundings clean and tidy, and our stinginess in keeping our  houses in good repair \u2013 all these combined with the difference in  religion, contributed to fan the flame of antagonism. Through  legislation this antagonism found its expression in the  disfranchising bill and the bill to impose a tax on the indentured  Indians. Independent of legislation a number of pinpricks had  already been started.  The first suggestion was that the Indian labourers should be  forcibly repatriated, so that the term of their indentures might  expire in India. The Government of India was not likely to accept  the suggestion. Another proposal was therefore made to the effect  that:  . the indentured labourer should return to India on the expiry of his indenture; or that  . he should sign a fresh indenture every two years, an increment being given at each renewal; and that  . in the case of his refusal to return to India or renew the indenture he should pay an annual tax of \u00a3.  A deputation composed of Sir Henry Binns and Mr. Mason was sent to  India to get the proposal approved by the Government there. The  Viceroy at that time was Lord Elgin. He disapproved of the \u00a3 tax,  but agreed to a poll tax of \u00a3. I thought then, as I do even now,  that this was a serious blunder on the part of the Viceroy. In  giving his approval he had in no way thought of the interests of  India. It was no part of his duty thus to accommodate the Natal  Europeans. In the course of three or four years an indentured labourer with his wife and each male child over  and female child  over  came under the impost. To levy a yearly tax of \u00a3 from a  family of four \u2013 husband, wife and two children \u2013 when the average  income of the husband was never more than s. a month, was  atrocious and unknown anywhere else in the world.  We organized a fierce campaign against this tax. If the Natal Indian  Congress had remained silent on the subject, the Viceroy might have  approved of even the \u00a3 tax. The reduction from \u00a3 to \u00a3 was  probably due solely to the Congress agitation. But I may be mistaken  in thinking so. It may be possible that the Indian Government had  disapproved of the \u00a3 tax from the beginning and reduced it to \u00a3,  irrespective of the opposition from the Congress. In any case it was  a breach of trust on the part of the Indian Government. As trustee  of the welfare of India, the Viceroy ought never to have approved of  this inhuman tax.  The Congress could not regard it as any great achievement to have  succeeded in getting the tax reduced from \u00a3 to \u00a3. The regret was  still there that it had not completely safeguarded the interests of  the indentured Indians. It ever remained its determination to get  the tax remitted, but it was twenty years before the determination was  realized. And when it was realized, it came as a result of the labours of not only the Natal Indians but of all the Indians in  South Africa. The breach of faith with the late Mr. Gokhale became  the occasion of the final campaign, in which the indentured Indians  took their full share, some of them losing their lives as a result  of the firing that was resorted to, and over ten thousand suffering  imprisonment.  But truth triumphed in the end. The sufferings of the Indians were  the expression of that truth. Yet it would not have triumphed except  for unflinching faith, great patience, and incessant effort. Had the  community given up the struggle, had the Congress abandoned the  campaign and submitted to the tax as inevitable, the hated impost  would have continued to be levied from the indentured Indians until  this day, to the eternal shame of the Indians in South Africa and of  the whole of India.  I found myself entirely absorbed in the service of the community,  the reason behind it was my desire for self-realization. I had made  the religion of service my own, as I felt that God could be realized  only through service. And service for me was the service of India,  because it came to me without my seeking, because I had an aptitude  for it. I had gone to South Africa for travel, for finding an escape  from Kathiawad intrigues and for gaining my own livelihood. But as I  have said, I found myself in search of God and striving for self-realization. Christian friends had whetted my appetite for knowledge, which had  become almost insatiable, and they would not leave me in peace, even  if I desired to be indifferent. In Durban Mr. Spencer Walton, the  head of the South Africa General Mission, found me out. I became  almost a member of his family. At the back of this acquaintance was  of course my contact with Christians in Pretoria. Mr. Walton had a  manner all his own. I do not recollect his ever having invited me to  embrace Christianity. But he placed his life as an open book before  me, and let me watch all his movements. Mrs. Walton was a very  gentle and talented woman. I liked the attitude of this couple. We  knew the fundamental differences between us. Any amount of  discussion could not efface them. Yet even differences prove  helpful, where there is tolerance, charity and truth. I liked Mr.  and Mrs. Walton's humility, perseverance and devotion to work, and  we met very frequently.  This friendship kept alive my interest in religion. It was  impossible now to get the leisure that I used to have in Pretoria  for my religious studies. But what little time I could spare I  turned to good account. My religious correspondence continued.  Raychandbhai was guiding me. Some friend sent me Narmadashanker's  book Dharma Vichar. Its preface proved very helpful. I had heard about the Bohemian way  in which the poet had lived, and a description in the preface of the  revolution effected in his life by his religious studies captivated  me. I came to like the book, and read it from cover to cover with  attention. I read with interest Max Muller's book, India \u2013 What Can It Teach Us?  and the translation of the Upanishads  published by the Theosophical Society. All this enhanced my regard  for Hinduism, and its beauties began to grow upon me. It did not,  however, prejudice me against other religions. I read  Washington Irving's Life of Mahomet and His Successors  and Carlyle's panegyric on the Prophet. These books raised Muhammad  in my estimation. I also read a book called The Sayings of Zarathustra. Thus I gained more knowledge of the different religions. The study  stimulated my self-introspection and fostered in me the habit of  putting into practice whatever appealed to me in my studies. Thus I  began some of the Yogic practices, as well as I could understand  them from a reading of the Hindu books. But I could not get on very  far, and decided to follow them with the help of some expert when I  returned to India. The desire has never been fulfilled. I made too an intensive study of Tolstoy's books.  The Gospels in Brief, What to Do?  and other books made a deep impression on me. I began to realize  more and more the infinite possibilities of universal love. About the same time I came in contact with another Christian family.  At their suggestion I attended the Wesleyan church every Sunday. For  these days I also had their standing invitation to dinner. The  church did not make a favourable impression on me. The sermons  seemed to be uninspiring. The congregation did not strike me as  being particularly religious. They were not an assembly of devout  souls; they appeared rather to be worldly-minded people, going to  church for recreation and in conformity to custom. Here, at times, I  would involuntarily doze. I was ashamed, but some of my neighbours,  who were in no better case, lightened the shame. I could not go on  long like this, and soon gave up attending the service. My connection with the family I used to visit every Sunday was  abruptly broken. In fact it may be said that I was warned to visit  it no more. It happened thus. My hostess was a good and simple  woman, but somewhat narrow-minded. We always discussed religious  subjects. I was then re-reading Arnold's Light of Asia.  Once we began to compare the life of Jesus with that of Buddha.  'Look at Gautama's compassion!' said I. 'It was not confined to  mankind, it was extended to all living beings. Does not one's heart  overflow with love to think of the lamb joyously perched on his  shoulders? One fails to notice this love for all living beings in  the life of Jesus.' The comparison pained the good lady. I could  understand her feelings. I cut the matter short, and we went to the  dining room. Her son, a cherub aged scarcely five, was also with us.  I am happiest when in the midst of children, and this youngster and  I had long been friends. I spoke derisively of the piece of meat on  his plate and in high praise of the apple on mine. The innocent boy  was carried away and joined in my praise of the fruit.  But the mother? she was dismayed.  I was warned. I checked myself and changed the subject. The  following week I visited the family as usual, but not without  trepidation. I did not see that I should stop going there, I did not  think it proper either. But the good lady made my way easy.  'Mr. Gandhi,' she said, 'please don't take it ill if I feel obliged to  tell you that my boy is none the better for your company. Every day  he hesitates to eat meat and asks for fruit, reminding me of your  argument. This is too much. If he gives up meat, he is bound to get  weak, if not ill. How could I bear it? Your discussion should  henceforth be only with us elders. They are sure to react badly on  children.'  'Mrs---,' I replied, 'I am sorry. I can understand your feelings as  a parent, for I too have children. We can very easily end this  unpleasant state of things. What I eat and omit to eat is bound to  have a greater effect on the child than what I say. The best way,  therefore, is for me to stop these visits. That certainly need not  affect our friendship.'  'I thank you,' she said with evident relief.  Practice as a lawyer was and remained for me a subordinate occupation. It was  necessary that I should concentrate on public work to justify my  stay in Natal. The despatch of the petition regarding the  disfranchising bill was not sufficient in itself. Sustained  agitation was essential for making an impression on the Secretary of  State for the Colonies. For this purpose it was thought necessary to  bring into being a permanent organization. So I consulted Sheth  Abdulla and other friends, and we all decided to have a public  organization of a permanent character.  To find out a name to be given to the new organization perplexed me  sorely. It was not to identify itself with any particular party. The  name 'Congress', I knew, was in bad odour with the Conservatives in  England, and yet the Congress was the very life of India. I wanted  to popularize it in Natal. It savoured of cowardice to hesitate to  adopt the name. Therefore, with full explanation of my reasons, I  recommended that the organization should be called the Natal Indian  Congress, and on the nd May the Natal Indian Congress came into  being.  Dada Abdulla's spacious room was packed to the full on that day. The  Congress received the enthusiastic approval of all present. Its  constitution was simple, the subscription was heavy. Only he who  paid five shillings monthly could be a member. The well-to-do  classes were persuaded to subscribe as much as they could. Abdulla  Sheth headed the list with \u00a3 per month. Two other friends also  put down the same. I thought I should not stint my subscription, and  put down a pound per month. This was for me no small amount. But I  thought that I would not be beyond my means, if I was to pay my way  at all. And God helped me. We thus got a  considerable number of members who subscribed \u00a3 per month. The  number of those who put down s. was even larger. Besides this,  there were donations which were gratefully accepted.  Experience showed that no one paid his subscription for the mere  asking. It was impossible to call frequently on members outside  Durban. The enthusiasm of one moment seemed to wear away the next.  Even the members in Durban had to be considerably dunned before they  would pay in their subscriptions.  The task of collecting subscriptions lay with me, I being the  secretary. And we came to a stage when I had to keep my clerk  engaged all day long in the work of collection. The man got tired of  the job, and I felt that, if the situation was to be improved, the  subscriptions should be made payable annually and not monthly and  that too strictly in advance. So I called a meeting of the Congress.  Everyone welcomed the proposal for making the subscription annual  instead of monthly and for fixing the minimum at \u00a3. Thus the work  of collection was considerably facilitated.  I had learnt at the outset not to carry on public work with borrowed  money. One could rely on people's promises in most matters except in  respect of money. I had never found people quick to pay the amounts  they had undertaken to subscribe, and the Natal Indians were no  exception to the rule. As, therefore, no work was done unless there  were funds on hand, the Natal Indian Congress has never been in  debt.  My co-workers evinced extraordinary enthusiasm in canvassing  members. It was work which interested them and was at the same time  an invaluable experience. Large numbers of people gladly came  forward with cash subscriptions. Work in the distant villages of the  interior was rather difficult. People did not know the nature of  public work. And yet we had invitations to visit far away places,  leading merchants of every place extending their hospitality.  On one occasion during this tour the situation was rather difficult.  We expected our host to contribute \u00a3, but he refused to give  anything more than \u00a3. If we had accepted that amount from him,  others would have followed suit, and our collections would have been  spoiled. It was a late hour of the night, and we were all hungry.  But how could we dine without having first obtained the amount we  were bent on getting? All persuasion was useless. The host seemed to  be adamant. Other merchants in the town reasoned with him, and we  all sat up throughout the night, he as well as we determined not to  budge one inch. Most of my co-workers were burning with rage, but  they contained themselves. At last, when day was already breaking,  the host yielded, paid down \u00a3 and feasted us. This happened at Tongaat,  but the repercussion of the incident was felt as far as  Stanger on the North Coast and Charlestown in the interior. It also  hastened our work of collection.  But collecting funds was not the only thing to do. In fact I had  long learnt the principle of never having more money at one's  disposal than necessary.  Meetings used to be held once a month or even once a week if  required. Minutes of the proceedings of the preceding meeting would  be read, and all sorts of questions would be discussed. People had  no experience of taking part in public discussion or of speaking  briefly and to the point. Everyone hesitated to stand up to speak. I  explained to them the rules of procedure at meetings and they  respected them. They realized that it was an education for them,  and many who had never been accustomed to speaking before an  audience soon acquired the habit of thinking and speaking publicly  about matters of public interest.  Knowing that in public work minor expenses at times absorbed large  accounts, I had decided not to have even the receipt books printed in  the beginning. I had a cyclostyle machine in my office, on which I  took copies of receipts and reports. Such things I began to get  printed only when the Congress coffers were full, and when the  number of members and work had increased. Such economy is essential  for every organization, and yet I know that it is not always  exercised. That is why I have thought it proper to enter into these  little details of the beginnings of a small but growing  organization.  People never cared to have receipts for the amounts  they paid, but we always insisted on the receipts being given. Every  pie was thus clearly accounted for, and I dare say the account books  for the year  can be found intact even today in the records of  Natal Indian Congress. Carefully kept accounts are a  sine qua non for any organization. Without them it falls into disrepute. Without  properly kept accounts it is impossible to maintain truth in its  pristine purity.  Another feature of the Congress was service of colonial-born  educated Indians. The Colonial-born Indian Educational Association  was founded under the auspices of the Congress. The members  consisted mostly of these educated youths. They had to pay a nominal  subscription. The Association served to ventilate their needs and  grievances, to stimulate thought amongst them, to bring them into  touch with Indian merchants and also to afford them scope for  service of the community. It was a sort of debating society. The  members met regularly and spoke or read papers on different  subjects. A small library was also opened in connection with the  Association.  The third feature of the Congress was propaganda. This consisted in  acquainting the English in South Africa and England and people in  India with the real state of things in Natal. With that end in view  I wrote two pamphlets. The first was An Appeal to Every Briton in South Africa.  It contained a statement, supported by evidence, of the general  condition of Natal Indians. The other was entitled The Indian Franchise \u2013 An Appeal.  It contained a brief history of the Indian franchise in Natal with  facts and figures. I had devoted considerable labour and study to  the preparation of these pamphlets, and the result was quite  commensurate with the trouble taken. They were widely  circulated.  All this activity resulted in winning the Indians numerous friends  in South Africa and in obtaining the active sympathy of all parties  in India. It also opened out and placed before the South African  Indians a definite line of action.  We shall, for a moment, take leave of the Ashram, which in the very  beginning had to weather internal and external storms, and briefly  advert to a matter that engaged my attention.  Indentured labourers were those who had emigrated from India to  labour under an indenture for five years or less. Under the  Smuts-Gandhi settlement of , the \u00a3 tax in respect of the  indentured emigrants to Natal had been abolished, but the general  emigration from India still needed treatment.  In March  Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji moved a resolution in  the Imperial Legislative Council for the abolition of the indenture  system. In accepting the motion Lord Hardinge announced that he had  'obtained from His Majesty's Government the promise of the abolition  in due course' of the system. I felt, however, that India could not  be satisfied with so very vague an assurance, but ought to agitate  for immediate abolition. India had tolerated the system through   sheer negligence, and I believed the time had come when people could  successfully agitate for this redress. I met some of the leaders,  wrote in the press, and saw that public opinion was solidly in favour of  immediate abolition. Might this be a fit subject for  Satyagraha? I had no doubt that it was, but I did not know the  modus operandi. In the meantime the Viceroy had made no secret of the meaning of  'the eventual abolition', which, as he said, was abolition 'within  such reasonable time as will allow of alternative arrangements  introduced.'  So in February , Pandit Malaviyaji asked for leave to introduce  a bill for the immediate abolition of the system. Lord Chelmsford  refused permission. It was time for me to tour the country for an  all-India agitation.  Before I started the agitation I thought it proper to wait upon the  Viceroy. So I applied for an interview. He immediately granted it.  Mr. Maffey, now Sir John Maffey, was his private secretary. I came  in close contact with him. I had a satisfactory talk with Lord  Chelmsford who, without being definite, promised to be a helpful. I began my tour from Bombay. Mr. Jehangir Petit undertook to convene  the meeting under the auspices of the Imperial Citizenship  Association. The Executive Committee of the Association met first  for framing the resolutions to be moved at the meeting. Dr. Stanley  Reed, Sjt. (now Sir) Lallubhai Samaldas, Sjt. Natarajan and Mr.  Petit were present at the Committee meeting. The discussion centred  round the fixing of the period within which the Government was to be  asked to abolish the system. There were three proposals, viz, for  abolition 'as soon as possible', abolition 'by the st July', and  'immediate abolition'. I was for a definite date, as we could then  decide what to do if the Government failed to accede to our request  within the time limit. Sjt. Lallubhai was for 'immediate' abolition.  He said 'immediate' indicated a shorter period than the st July. I  explained that the people would not understand the word 'immediate'.  If we wanted to get them to do something, they must have a more  definite word. Everyone would interpret 'immediate' in his own way -  Government one way, the people another way. There was no question of  misunderstanding 'the st of July', and if nothing was done by that  date, we could proceed further. Dr. Reed saw the force of the  argument, and ultimately Sjt. Lallubhai also agreed. We adopted the  st July as the latest date by which the abolition should be  announced, a resolution to that effect was passed at the public  meeting, and meetings throughout India resolved accordingly.  Mrs. Jaiji Petit put all her energies into the organization of a  ladies' deputation to the Viceroy. Amongst the ladies from Bombay  who formed the deputation, I remember the names of Lady Tata and the  late Dilshad Begam. The deputation had a great effect. The Viceroy  gave an encouraging reply.  I visited Karachi, Calcutta and various other places. There were  fine meetings everywhere, and there was unbounded enthusiasm. I had  not expected anything like it when the agitation was launched. In those days I used to travel alone, and had therefore wonderful  experiences. The C.I.D. men were always after me. But as I had nothing  to conceal, they did not molest me, nor did I cause them any  trouble. Fortunately I had not then received the stamp of Mahatmaship,  though the shout of that name was quite common where people knew me.  On one occasion the detectives disturbed me at several stations,  asked for my ticket and took down the number. I, of course, readily  replied to all questions they asked. My fellow passengers had taken  me to be a sadhu or a fakir. When they saw that I was being  molested at every station, they were exasperated and swore at the  detectives. 'Why are you worrying the poor sadhu for nothing?' they  protested. 'Don't you show these scoundrels your ticket,' they said,  addressing me.  I said to them gently: 'It is no trouble to show them my ticket.  They are doing their duty.' The passengers were not satisfied, they  evinced more and more sympathy, and strongly objected to this sort  of ill- treatment of innocent men.  But the detectives were nothing. The real hardship was the third  class travelling. My bitterest experience was from Lahore to Delhi.  I was going to Calcutta from Karachi via  Lahore where I had to change trains. It was impossible to find a  place in the train. It was full, and those who  could get in did so by sheer force, often sneaking through windows  if the doors were locked. I had to reach Calcutta on the date fixed  for the meeting, and if I missed this train I could not arrive in  time. I had almost given up hope of getting in. No one was willing  to accept me, when a porter discovering my plight came to me and said,  'Give me twelve annas and I'll get you a seat.' 'Yes,' said I, 'you  shall have twelve annas if you do procure me a seat.' The young man  went from carriage to carriage entreating passengers but no one  heeded him. As the train was about to start, some passengers said,  'There is no room here, but you can shove him in if you like. He  will have to stand.' 'Well?' asked the young porter. I readily  agreed, and he shoved me in bodily through the window. Thus I got  in and the porter earned his twelve annas.  The night was a trial. The other passengers were sitting somehow. I  stood two hours, holding the chain of the upper bunk. Meanwhile some  of the passengers kept worrying me incessantly. 'Why will you not  sit down?' they asked. I tried to reason with them saying there was  no room, but they could not tolerate my standing, though they were  lying full length on the upper bunks. They did not tire of worrying  me, neither did I tire of gently replying to them. This at last  mollified them. Some of them asked me my name, and made room for me.  Patience was thus rewarded. I was dead tired, and my head was  reeling. God sent help when it was most needed.  In that way I somehow reached Delhi and thence Calcutta. The  Maharaja of Cassimbazar, the president of the Calcutta meeting, was  my host. Just as in Karachi, here also there was unbounded  enthusiasm. The meeting was attended by several Englishmen. Before the st July the Government announced that indentured  emigration from India was stopped.  It was in  that I drafted the first petition protesting against  the system, and I had then hoped that this 'semi-slavery,' as Sir W.  W. Hunter used to call the system, would some day be brought to an  end.  There were many who aided in the agitation which was started in  , but I cannot help saying that potential Satyagraha hastened  the end.  For further details of that agitation and of those who took part in  it, I refer the reader to my Satyagraha in South Africa.  It has always been impossible for me to reconcile myself to any one  member of the body politic remaining out of use. I have always been  loath to hide or connive at the weak points of the community or to  press for its rights without having purged it of its blemishes.  Therefore, ever since my settlement in Natal, I had been endeavouring to clear the community of a charge that had been  leveled against it, not without a certain amount of truth. The  charge had often been made that the Indian was slovenly in his  habits and did not keep his house and surroundings clean. The  principal men of the community had, therefore, already begun to put  their houses in order, but house-to-house inspection was undertaken  only when plague was reported to be imminent in Durban. This was  done after consulting, and gaining the approval of, the city  fathers, who had desired our co-operation. Our co-operation made  work easier for them and at the same time lessened our hardships.  For whenever there is an outbreak of epidemics, the executive, as a  general rule, get impatient, take excessive measures and behave to  such as may have incurred their displeasure with a heavy hand. The  community saved itself from this oppression by voluntarily taking  sanitary measures.  But I had some bitter experiences. I saw that I could not so easily  count on the help of the community in getting it to do its own duty,  as I could in claiming for it rights. At some places I met with  insults, at others with polite indifference. It was too much for  people to bestir themselves to keep their surroundings clean. To  expect them to find money for the work was out of the question.  These experiences taught me, better than ever before, that without  infinite patience it was impossible to get the people to do any  work. It is the reformer who is anxious for the reform, and not  society, from which he should expect nothing better than opposition,  abhorrence and even mortal persecution. Why may not society regard  as retrogression what the reformer holds dear as life itself?  Nevertheless the result of this agitation was that the Indian  community learnt to recognize more or less the necessity for keeping  their houses and environments clean. I gained the esteem of the  authorities. They saw that, though I had made it my business to  ventilate grievances and press for rights, I was no less keen and  insistent upon self-purification.  There was one thing, however, which still remained to be done,  namely, the awakening in the Indian settler of a sense of duty to  the motherland. India was poor, the Indian settler went to South  Africa in search of wealth, and he was bound to contribute part of  his earnings for the benefit of his countrymen in the hour of their  adversity. This the settler did during the terrible famines of   and . They contributed handsomely for famine relief, and more so  in  than in . We had appealed to Englishmen also for funds,  and they had responded well. Even the indentured Indians gave their  share to the contribution, and the system inaugurated at the time of  these famines has been continued ever since, and we know that  Indians in South Africa never fail to send handsome contributions to  India in times of national calamity.  Thus service of the Indians in South Africa ever revealed to me new  implications of Truth at every stage. Truth is like a vast tree,  which yields more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. The  deeper the search in the mine of Truth, the richer the discovery of  the gems buried there, in the shape of openings for an ever greater  variety of service.  I must skip many other experiences of the period between  and   and come straight to the Boer War.  When the war was declared, my personal sympathies were all with the  Boers, but I believed then that I had yet no right, in such cases,  to enforce my individual convictions. I have minutely dealt with the  inner struggle regarding this in my history of the Satyagraha in  South Africa, and I must not repeat the argument here. I invite the  curious to turn to those pages. Suffice it to say that my loyalty to  the British rule drove me to participation with the British in that  war. I felt that, if I demanded rights as a British citizen, it was  also my duty, as such, to participate in the defence of the British  Empire. I held then that India could achieve her complete  emancipation only within and through the British Empire. So I  collected together as many comrades as possible, and with very  great difficulty got their services accepted as an ambulance corps.  The average Englishman believed that the Indian was a coward,  incapable of taking risks or looking beyond his immediate  self-interest. Many English friends, therefore, threw cold water on  my plan. But Dr. Booth supported it whole-heartedly. He trained us  in ambulance work. We secured medical certificates of fitness for  service. Mr. Laughton and the late Mr. Escombe enthusiastically  supported the plan, and we applied at last for service at the front.  The Government thankfully acknowledged our application, but said  that our services were not then needed.  I would not rest satisfied, however, with this refusal. Through the  introduction of Dr. Booth, I called on the Bishop of Natal. There  were many Christian Indians in our corps. The Bishop was delighted  with my proposal and promised to help us in getting our services  accepted.  Time too was working with us. The Boer had shown more  pluck, determination and bravery than had been expected; and our  services were ultimately needed.  Our corps was , strong, with  nearly  leaders, About three hundred were free Indians, and the  rest indentured. Dr. Booth was also with us. The corps acquitted  itself well. Though our work was to be outside the firing line, and  though we had the protection of the Red Cross, we were asked at a  critical moment to serve within the firing line. The reservation had  not been of our seeking. The authorities did not want us to be  within the range of fire. The situation, however, was changed after  the repulse at Spion Kop, and General Buller sent the message that,  though we were not bound to take the risk, Government would be  thankful if we would do so and fetch the wounded from the field. We  had no hesitation, and so the action at Spion Kop found us working  within the firing line. During these days we had to march from  twenty to twenty-five miles a day, bearing the wounded on  stretchers. Amongst the wounded we had the honour of carrying  soldiers like General Woodgate.  The corps was disbanded after six weeks' service. After the reverses  at Spion Kop and Vaalkranz, the British Commander-in-Chief abandoned  the attempt to relieve Ladysmith and other places by summary  procedure, and decided to proceed slowly, awaiting reinforcements  from England and India.  Our humble work was at the moment much applauded, and the Indians'  prestige was enhanced. The newspapers published laudatory rhymes  with the refrain, 'We are sons of Empire after all.'  General Buller mentioned with appreciation the work of the corps in  his despatch, and the leaders were awarded the War Medal.  The Indian community became better organized. I got into closer  touch with the indentured Indians. There came a greater awakening  amongst them, and the feeling that Hindus, Musalmans, Christians,  Tamilians, Gujaratis and Sindhis were all Indians and children of  the same motherland took deep root amongst them. Everyone believed  that the Indians' grievances were now sure to be redressed. At the  moment the white man's attitude seemed to be distinctly changed. The  relations formed with the whites during the war were of the  sweetest. We had come in contact with thousands of tommies. They  were friendly with us and thankful for being there to serve them. I cannot forbear from recording a sweet reminiscence of how human  nature shows itself at its best in moments of trial. We were  marching towards Chievely Camp where Lieutenant Roberts, the son of  Lord Roberts, had received a mortal wound. Our corps had the honour  of carrying the body from the field. It was a sultry day - the day  of our march. Everyone was thirsting for water. There was a tiny  brook on the way where we could slake our thirst. But who was to  drink first? We had proposed to come in after the tommies had  finished. But they would not begin first and urged us to do so, and  for a while a pleasant competition went on for giving precedence to  one another.  On my relief from war-duty I felt that my work was no longer in South  Africa but in India. Not that there was nothing to be done in South  Africa, but I was afraid that my main business might become merely  money-making.  Friends at home were also pressing me to return, and I  felt that I should be of more service in India. And for the work  in South Africa, there were, of course, Messrs Khan and Mansukhlal  Naazar. So I requested my co-workers to relieve me. After very great  difficulty my request was conditionally accepted, the condition  being that I should be ready to go back to South Africa if, within a  year, the community should need me. I thought it was a difficult  condition but the love that bound me to the community made me accept  it.  I said in the last chapter that the sea was rough in Bombay harbour, not an  unusual thing in the Arabian Sea in June and July. It had been  choppy all the way from Aden. Almost every passenger was sick; I  alone was in perfect form, staying on deck to see the stormy surge,  and enjoying the splash of the waves. At breakfast there would be  just one or two people besides myself, eating their oatmeal porridge  from plates carefully held in their laps, lest the porridge itself  find its place there.The outer  storm was to me a symbol of the inner. But even as the former left  me unperturbed, I think I can say the same thing about the latter.  There was the trouble with the caste that was to confront me. I have  already adverted to my helplessness in starting on my profession.  And then, as I was a reformer, I was taxing myself as to how best to  begin certain reforms. But there was even more in store for me than  I knew.My elder  brother had come to meet me at the dock. He had already made the  acquaintance of Dr. Mehta and his elder brother, and as Dr. Mehta  insisted on putting me up at his house, we went there. Thus the  acquaintance begun in England continued in India and ripened into a  permanent friendship between the two families.I was  pining to see my mother. I did not know that she was no more in the  flesh to receive me back into her bosom. The sad news was now given  me, and I underwent the usual ablution. My brother had kept me  ignorant of her death, which took place whilst I was still in  England. He wanted to spare me the blow in a foreign land. The news,  however, was none the less a severe shock to me. But I must not  dwell upon it. My grief was even greater than over my father's  death. Most of my cherished hopes were shattered. But I remember  that I did not give myself up to any wild expression of grief. I  could even check the tears, and took to life just as though nothing  had happened.Dr. Mehta  introduced me to several friends, one of them being his brother Shri  Revashankar Jagjivan, with whom there grew up a lifelong friendship.  But the introduction that I need particularly take note of was the  one to the poet Raychand or Rajchandra, the son-in-law of an elder  brother of Dr. Mehta, and partner of the firm of jewellers conducted  in the name of Revashankar Jagjivan. He was not above twenty-five  then, but my first meeting with him convinced me that he was a man  of great character and learning. He was also known as  Shatavadhani (one having the faculty of remembering or attending to a hundred things  simultaneously), and Dr. Mehta recommended me to see some of his  memory feats. I exhausted my vocabulary of all the European tongues  I knew, and asked the poet to repeat the words. He did so in the  precise order in which I had given them. I envied his gift without,  however, coming under its spell. The thing that did cast its spell  over me I came to know afterwards. This was his wide knowledge of  the scriptures, his spotless character, and his burning passion for  self-realization. I saw later that this last was the only thing for  which he lived. The following lines of Muktanand were always on his  lips and engraved on the tablets of his heart: 'I shall think myself blessed only when I see Him in every one of my daily acts;  Verily He is the thread, Which supports Muktanand's life.' Raychandbhai's commercial transactions covered hundreds of  thousands. He was a connoisseur of pearls and diamonds. No knotty  business problem was too difficult for him. But all these things  were not the centre round which his life revolved. That centre was  the passion to see God face to face. Amongst the things on his  business table there were invariably to be found some religious book  and his diary. The moment he finished his business he opened the  religious book or the diary. Much of his published writings is a  reproduction from this diary. The man who, immediately on finishing  his talk about weighty business transaction, began to write about  the hidden things of the spirit could evidently not be a businessman  at all, but a real seeker after Truth. And I saw him thus absorbed  in godly pursuits in the midst of business, not once or twice, but  very often. I never saw him lose his state of equipoise. There was  no business or other selfish tie that bound him to me, and yet I  enjoyed the closest association with him. I was but a briefless  barrister then, and yet whenever I saw him he would engage me in  conversation of a seriously religious nature. Though I was then  groping and could not be said to have any serious interest in  religious discussion, still I found his talk of absorbing interest.  I have since met many a religious leader or teacher. I have tried to  meet the heads of various faiths, and I must say that no one else  has ever made on me the impression that Raychandbhai did. His words  went straight home to me. His intellect compelled as great a regard  from me as his moral earnestness, and deep down in me was the  conviction that he would never willingly lead me astray and would  always confide to me his innermost thoughts. In my moments of  spiritual crisis, therefore, he was my refuge. And yet, in spite of this regard for him I could not enthrone him in my heart  as my Guru. The throne has remained vacant and my search still  continues. I believe in the Hindu theory of Guru and his importance in spiritual  realization. I think there is a great deal of truth in the doctrine  that true knowledge is impossible without a Guru. An imperfect  teacher may be tolerable in mundane matters, but not in spiritual  matters. Only a perfect gnani deserves  to be enthroned as Guru. There must, therefore, be ceaseless  striving after perfection. For one gets the Guru that one deserves.  Infinite striving after perfection is one's right. It is its own  reward. The rest is in the hands of God. Thus, though I could not place Raychandbhai on the throne of my heart as  Guru, we shall see he was, on many occasions, my guide and helper.  Three moderns have left a deep impress on my life, and captivated  me: Raychandbhai by his living contact; Tolstoy by his book, The  Kingdom of God is Within You; and Ruskin by his Unto this Last. But of these more in their proper place.  While in Bombay, I began, on the one hand, my study of Indian law and, on  the other, my experiments in dietetics in which Virchand Gandhi, a friend, joined me. My brother, for his part, was trying his best to get me briefs.The study of Indian law was a tedious business. The Civil Procedure Code I  could in no way get on with. Not so however, with the Evidence Act.  Virchand Gandhi was reading for the solicitor's examination and  would tell me all sorts of stories about barristers and vakils. 'Sir  Pherozeshah's ability,' he would say, 'lies in his profound  knowledge of law. He has the Evidence Act by heart and knows all the  cases on the thirty-second section. Badruddin Tyabji's wonderful  power of argument inspires the judges with awe.'The stories of stalwarts such as these would unnerve me. 'It is not unusual', he would add, 'for a barrister to vegetate for five or  seven years. That's why I have signed the articles for solicitorship.  You should count yourself lucky if you can paddle your own canoe in  three years' time.'Expenses were mounting up every month. To have a barrister's board outside  the house, whilst still preparing for the barrister's profession  inside, was a thing to which I could not reconcile myself. Hence I  could not give undivided attention to my studies. I developed some  liking for the Evidence Act and read Mayne's Hindu Law with deep  interest, but I had not the courage to conduct a case. I was  helpless beyond words, even as the bride come fresh to her  father-in- law's house!About  this time, I took up the case of one Mamibai. It was a 'small  cause.' 'You will have to pay some commission to the tout,' I was  told. I emphatically declined.'But even  that great criminal lawyer Mr. So-and-So, who makes three to four  thousand a month, pays commission!''I do not  need to emulate him,' I rejoined. 'I should be content with Rs.   a month. Father did not get more.''But  those days are gone. Expenses in Bombay have gone up frightfully.  You must be business-like.'I was  adamant. I gave no commission, but got Mamibai's case all the same.  It was an easy case. I charged Rs.  for my fees. The case was not  likely to last longer than a day.......This was  my d\u00e9but in the Small Causes Court. I appeared for the defendant and had thus to  cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses. I stood up, but my heart  sank into my boots. My head was reeling and I felt as though the  whole court was doing likewise. I could think of no question to ask.  The judge must have laughed, and the vakils no doubt enjoyed the  spectacle. But I was past seeing anything. I sat down and told the  agent that I could not conduct the case, that he had better engage  Patel and have the fee back from me. Mr. Patel was duly engaged for  Rs. . To him, of course, the case was child's play. I hastened from the Court, not knowing whether my client won or lost  her case, but I was ashamed of myself, and decided not to take up  any more cases until I had courage enough to conduct them. Indeed I  did not go to Court again until I went to South Africa. There was no  virtue in my decision. I had simply made a virtue of necessity.  There would be no one so foolish as to entrust his case to me, only  to lose it!But there was another case in store for me at Bombay. It was a memorial  to be drafted. A poor Mussalman's land was confiscated in Porbandar.  He approached me as the worthy son of a worthy father. His case  appeared to be weak, but I consented to draft a memorial for him,  the cost of printing to be borne by him. I drafted it and read it  out to friends. They approved of it, and that to some extent made me  feel confident that I was qualified enough to draft a memorial, as  indeed I really was. My business could flourish if I drafted memorials without any fees. But  that would being no grist to the mill. So I thought I might take up  a teacher's job. My knowledge of English was good enough, and I  should have loved to teach English to Matriculation boys in some  school. In this way I could have met part at least of the expenses.  I came across an advertisement in the papers: 'Wanted, an English  teacher to teach one hour daily. Salary Rs .' The advertisement  was from a famous high school. I applied for the post and was called  for an interview. I went there in high spirits, but when the  principal found that I was not a graduate, he regretfully refused  me.'But I have passed the London Matriculation with Latin as my second  language.''True but we want a graduate.'There was  no help for it. I wrung my hands in despair. My brother also felt  much worried. We both came to the conclusion that it was no use  spending more time in Bombay. I should settle in Rajkot where my  brother, himself a petty pleader, could give me some work in the  shape of drafting applications and memorials. And then as there was  already a household at Rajkot, the breaking up of the one at Bombay  meant a considerable saving. I liked the suggestion. My little  establishment was thus closed after a stay of six months in Bombay. I used to attend High Court daily whilst in Bombay, but I cannot say that I  learnt anything there. I had not sufficient knowledge to learn much.  Often I could not follow the cases and dozed off. There were others  also who kept me company in this, and thus lightened my load of  shame. After a time, I even lost the sense of shame, as I learnt to  think that it was fashionable to doze in the High Court. If the present generation has also its briefless barristers like me in  Bombay, I would commend them a little practical precept about  living. Although I lived in Girgaum I hardly ever took a carriage or  a tram-car. I had made it a rule to walk to the High Court. It took  me quite forty-five minutes, and of course I invariably returned  home on foot. I had inured myself to the heat of the sun. This walk  to and from the Court saved a fair amount of money, and when many of  my friends in Bombay used to fall ill, I do not remember having once  had an illness. Even when I began to earn money, I kept up the  practice of walking to and from the office, and I am still reaping  the benefits of that practice.  My elder brother had built high hopes on me. The desire for wealth and  name and fame was great in him. He had a big heart, generous to a  fault. This, combined with his simple nature, had attracted to him  many friends, and through them he expected to get me briefs. He had  also assumed that I should have a swinging practice and had, in that  expectation, allowed the household expenses to become top-heavy. He  had also left no stone unturned in preparing the field for my  practice. The storm in my caste over my foreign voyage was still brewing. It had divided  the caste into two camps, one of which immediately re-admitted me,  while the other was bent on keeping me out. To please the former my  brother took me to Nasik before going to Rajkot, gave me a bath in  the sacred river and, on reaching Rajkot, gave a caste dinner. I did  not like all this. But my brother's love for me was boundless, and  my devotion to him was in proportion to it, and so I mechanically  acted as he wished, taking his will to be law. The trouble about  re-admission to the caste was thus practically over. I never tried to seek admission to the section that had refused it. Nor did  I feel even mental resentment against any of the headmen of that  section. Some of these regarded me with dislike, but I scrupulously  avoided hurting their feelings. I fully respected the caste  regulations about ex-communication. According to these, none of my  relations, including my father-in-law and mother-in-law, and even my  sister and brother-in-law, could entertain me; and I would not so  much as drink water at their houses. They were prepared secretly to  evade the prohibition, but it went against the grain with me to do a  thing in secret that I would not do in public. The result of my scrupulous conduct was that I never had occasion to be  troubled by the caste; nay, I have experienced nothing but affection  and generosity from the general body of the section that still  regards me as ex-communicated. They have even helped me in my work,  without ever expecting me to do anything for the caste. It is my  conviction that all these good things are due to my non-resistance.  Had I agitated for being admitted to the caste, had I attempted to  divide it into more camps, had I provoked the castemen, they would  surely have retaliated, and instead of steering clear of the storm,  I should on arrival from England, have found myself in a whirlpool  of agitation, and perhaps a party to dissimulation. My relations with my wife were still not as I desired. Even my stay in  England had not cured me of jealousy. I continued my squeamishness  and suspiciousness in respect of every little thing, and hence all  my cherished desires remained unfulfilled. I had decided that my  wife should learn reading and writing and that I should help her in  her studies, but my lust came in the way and she had to suffer for  my own shortcoming. Once I went the length of sending her away to  her father's house, and consented to receive her back only after I  had made her thoroughly miserable. I saw later that all this was  pure folly on my part. I had planned reform in the education of children. My brother had  children, and my own child which I had left at home when I went to  England was now a boy of nearly four. It was my desire to teach  these little ones physical exercise and make them hardy, and also to  give them the benefit of my personal guidance. In this I had my  brother's support and I succeeded in my efforts more or less. I very  much liked the company of children, and the habit of playing and  joking with them has stayed with me till today. I have ever since  thought that I should make a good teacher of children. The necessity for food 'reform' was obvious. Tea and coffee had already  found their place in the house. My brother had thought it fit to  keep some sort of English atmosphere ready for me on my return, and  to that end, crockery and such other things, which used to be kept  in the house only for special occasions, were now in general use. My  'reform' put the finishing touch. I introduced oatmeal porridge, and  cocoa was to replace tea and coffee. But in truth it became an  addition to tea and coffee. Boots and shoes were already there. I  completed the Europeanization by adding the European dress. Expenses thus went up. New things were added every day. We had succeeded in  tying a white elephant at our door. But how was the wherewithal to  be found? To start practice in Rajkot would have meant sure  ridicule. I had hardly the knowledge of a qualified vakil and yet I  expected to be paid ten times his fees! No client would be fool  enough to engage me. And even if such a one was to be found, should  I add arrogance and fraud to my ignorance, and increase the burden  of debt I owed to the world? Friends advised me to go to Bombay for some time in order to gain experience  of the High Court, to study Indian law and to try to get what briefs  I could. I took up the suggestion and went. In Bombay I started a household with a cook as incompetent as myself. He was a  Brahman. I did not treat him as a servant but as a member of the  household. He would pour water over himself but never wash. His dhoti was dirty, as also his sacred thread, and he was completely innocent of  the scriptures. But how was I to get a better cook? 'Well, Ravishankar,' (for that was his name), I would ask him, 'you may not  know cooking, but surely you must know your sandhya (daily worship), etc. 'Sandhya, sir! the plough is our sandhya and the  spade our daily ritual. That is the type of Brahman I am. I must  live on your mercy. Otherwise agriculture is of course there for  me.' So I had to be Ravishankar's teacher. Time I had enough. I began to do half  the cooking myself and introduced the English experiments in  vegetarian cookery. I invested in a stove, and with Ravishankar  began to run the kitchen. I had no scruples about inter-dining,  Ravishankar too came to have none, and so we went on merrily  together. There was only one obstacle. Ravishankar had sworn to  remain dirty and to keep the food unclean! But it was impossible for me to get along in Bombay for more than four or  five months, there being no income to square with the  ever-increasing expenditure. This was how I began life. I found the barrister's profession a bad job \u2013 much  show and little knowledge. I felt a crushing sense of my responsibility.  I was no doubt at fault in having gone to that officer. But his impatience  and overbearing anger were out of all proportion to my mistake. It  did not warrant expulsion. I can scarcely have taken up more than  five minutes of his time. But he simply could not endure my talking.  He could have politely asked me to go, but power had intoxicated him  to an inordinate extent. Later I came to know that patience was not  one of the virtues of this officer. It was usual for him to insult  his visitors. The slightest unpleasantness was sure to put the sahib out. Now most of my work would naturally be in his court. It was beyond me to  conciliate him. I had no desire to curry favour with him. Indeed,  having once threatened to proceed against him, I did not like to  remain silent.  Meanwhile I began to learn something of the petty politics of the country.  Kathiawad, being a conglomeration of small states, naturally had its  rich crop of politicals. Petty intrigues between states, and  intrigues of officers for power were the order of the day. Princes  were always at the mercy of others and ready to lend their ears to  sycophants. Even the sahib's peon had  to be cajoled, and the sahib's shirastedar was more  than his master, as he was his eyes, his ears and his interpreter.  The shirastedar's will was law, and his income was always reputed to be more than the sahib's.  This may have been an exaggeration, but he certainly lived beyond his salary.  This atmosphere appeared to me to be poisonous, and how to remain  unscathed was a perpetual problem for me.  I was thoroughly depressed and my brother clearly saw it. We both felt  that, if I could secure some job, I should be free from this  atmosphere of intrigue. But without intrigue a ministership or  judgeship was out of the question. And the quarrel with the  sahib stood in the way of my practice.  Probandar was then under administration, and I had some work there in the  shape of securing more powers for the prince. Also I had to see the  Administrator in respect of the heavy vighoti (land  rent) exacted from the Mers. This officer, though an Indian, was, I  found, one better than the sahib in  arrogance. He was able, but the ryots appeared to me to be none the  better off for his ability. I succeeded in securing a few more  powers for the Rana, but hardly any relief for the Mers. It struck  me that their cause was not even carefully gone into. So even in this mission I was comparatively disappointed. I thought justice  was not done to my clients, but I had not the means to secure it. At  the most I could have appealed to the Political Agent or to the  Governor who would have dismissed the appeal saying, 'We decline to  interfere.' If there had been any rule or regulation governing such  decisions, it would have been something, but here the sahib's will was  law.  I was exasperated.  In the meantime a Meman firm from Porbandar wrote to my brother making the  following offer: 'We have business in South Africa. Ours is a big  firm, and we have a big case there in the Court, our claim being \u00a3  ,. It has been going on for a long time. We have engaged the  services of the best vakils and barristers. If you sent your brother  there, he would be useful to us and also to himself. He would be  able to instruct our counsel better than ourselves. And he would  have the advantage of seeing a new part of the world, and of making  new acquaintances.'  My brother discussed the proposition with me. I could not clearly make  out whether I had simply to instruct the counsel or to appear in  court. But I was tempted.  My brother introduced me to the late Sheth Abdul Karim Jhaveri a  partner of Dada Abdulla & Co., the firm in question. 'It won't be a  difficult job,' the Sheth assured me. 'We have big Europeans as our  friends, whose acquaintance you will make. You can be useful to us  in our shop. Much of our correspondence is in English and you can  help us with that too. You will, of course, be our guest and hence  will have no expense whatever.'  'How long do you require my services?' I asked. 'And what will be the  payment?'  'Not more than a year. We will pay you a first class return fare and a sum of  \u00a3, all found.'  This was hardly going there as a barrister. It was going as a servant of the  firm. But I wanted somehow to leave India. There was also the  tempting opportunity of seeing a new country, and of having new  experience. Also I could send \u00a3 to my brother and help in the  expenses of the household. I closed with the offer without any  haggling, and got ready to go to South Africa.  Disappointed, I left Bombay and went to Rajkot where I set up my own office. Here  I got along moderately well. Drafting applications and memorials  brought me in, on an average, Rs  a month. For this work I had to  thank influence rather than my own ability, for my brother's partner  had a settled practice. All applications etc. which were, really or  to his mind, of an important character, he sent to big barristers.  To my lot fell the applications to be drafted on behalf of his poor  clients. I must confess that here I had to compromise the principle of giving no  commission, which in Bombay I had so scrupulously observed. I was  told that conditions in the two cases were different; that whilst in  Bombay commissions had to be paid to touts, here they had to be paid  to vakils who briefed you; and that here as in Bombay all  barristers, without exception, paid a percentage of their fees as  commission. The argument of my brother was, for me, unanswerable.  'You see,' said he, 'that I am in partnership with another vakil. I  shall always be inclined to make over to you all our cases with  which you can possibly deal, and if you refuse to pay a commission  to my partner, you are sure to embarrass me. As you and I have a  joint establishment, your fee comes to our common purse, and I  automatically get a share. But what about my partner? Supposing he  gave the same case to some other barrister he would certainly get  his commission from him.' I was taken in by this plea, and felt  that, if I was to practise as a barrister, I could not press my  principle regarding commissions in such cases. That is how I argued  with myself, or to put it bluntly, how I deceived myself. Let me  add, however, that I do not remember ever to have given commission  in respect of any other case. Though I thus began to make both ends meet, I got the first shock of my life  about this time. I had heard what a British officer was like, but up  to now had never been face to face with one. My brother had been secretary and adviser to the late Ranasaheb of  Porbandar before he was installed on his gadi,  and hanging over his head at this time was the charge of having  given wrong advice when in that office. The matter had gone to the  Political Agent who was prejudiced against my brother. Now I had  known this officer when in England, and he may be said to have been  fairly friendly to me. My brother thought that I should avail myself  of the friendship and, putting in a good word on his behalf, try to  disabuse the Political Agent of his prejudice. I did not at all like  this idea. I should not, I thought, try to take advantage of a  trifling acquaintance in England. If my brother was really at fault,  what use was my recommendation? If he was innocent, he should submit  a petition in the proper course and, confident of his innocence,  face the result. My brother did not relish this advice. 'You do not  know Kathiawad', he said, 'and you have yet to know the world. Only  influence counts here. It is not proper for you, a brother, to shirk  your duty, when you can clearly put in a good word about me to an  officer you know.' I could not refuse him, so I went to the officer much against my will. I  knew I had no right to approach him and was fully conscious that I  was compromising my self-respect. But I sought an appointment and  got it. I reminded him of the old acquaintance, but I immediately  saw that Kathiawad was different from England; that an officer on  leave was not the same as an officer on duty. The political Agent  owned the acquaintance, but the reminder seemed to stiffen him.  'Surely you have not come here to abuse that acquaintance, have  you?' appeared to be the meaning of that stiffness, and seemed to be  written on his brow. Nevertheless I opened my case. The sahib was  impatient. 'Your brother is an intriguer. I want to hear nothing  more from you. I have no time. If your brother has anything to say,  let him apply through the proper channel.' The answer was enough,  was perhaps deserved. But selfishness is blind. I went on with my  story. The sahib got up and said: 'You must go now.' 'But please hear me out,' said I. That made him more angry. He called his  peon and ordered him to show me the door. I was still hesitating  when the peon came in, placed his hands on my shoulders and put me  out of the room. The sahib went away as also the peon, and I departed, fretting and fuming. I at once  wrote out and sent over a note to this effect: 'You have insulted  me. You have assaulted me through your peon. If you make no amends,  I shall have to proceed against you.' Quick came the answer through his sowar: 'You were rude to me. I asked you to go and you would not. I had no option but  to order my peon to show you the door. Even after he asked you to  leave the office, you did not do so. He therefore had to use just  enough force to send you out. You are at liberty to proceed as you  wish.' With this answer in my pocket, I came home crest-fallen, and told my brother  all that had happened. He was grieved, but was at a loss as to how  to console me. He spoke to his vakil friends. For I did not know how  to proceed against the sahib.  Sir Pherozeshah Mehta happened to be in Rajkot at this time, having  come down from Bombay for some case. But how could a junior  barrister like me dare to see him? So I sent him the papers of my  case, through the vakil who had engaged him, and begged for his  advice. 'Tell Gandhi,' he said, 'such things are the common  experience of many vakils and barristers. He is still fresh from  England, and hot-blooded. He does not know British officers. If he  would earn something and have an easy time here, let him tear up the  note and pocket the insult. He will gain nothing by proceeding  against the sahib, and on the contrary will very likely ruin himself. Tell him he has  yet to know life.' The advice was as bitter as poison to me, but I had to swallow it. I  pocketed the insult, but also profited by it. 'Never again shall I  place myself in such a false position, never again shall I try to  exploit friendship in this way,' said I to myself, and since then I  have never been guilty of a breach of that determination. This shock  changed the course of my life. The port of Natal is Durban also known as Port Natal. Abdulla Sheth was  there to receive me. As the ship arrived at the quay and I watched  the people coming on board to meet their friends, I observed that  the Indians were not held in much respect. I could not fail to  notice a sort of snobbishness about the manner in which those who  knew Abdulla Sheth behaved towards him, and it stung me. Abdulla  Sheth had got used to it. Those who looked at me did so with a  certain amount of curiosity. My dress marked me out from other  Indians. I had a frock-coat and a turban, an imitation of the  Bengal pugree. I was taken to the firm's quarters and shown into the room set apart  for me, next to Abdulla Sheth's. He did not understand me, I could  not understand him. He read the papers his brother had sent through  me, and felt more puzzled. He thought his brother had sent him a  white elephant. My style of dress and living struck him as being  expensive like that of the Europeans. There was no particular work  then which could be given me. Their case was going on in the  Transvaal. There was no meaning in sending me there immediately. And  how far could he trust my ability and honesty? He would not be in  Pretoria to watch me. The defendants were in Pretoria, and for aught  he knew they might bring undue influence to bear on me. And if work  in connection with the case in question was not to be entrusted to  me, what work could I be given to do, as all other work could be  done much better by his clerks? The clerks could be brought to book,  if they did wrong. Could I be, if I also happened to err? So if no  work in connection with the case could be given me, I should have to  be kept for nothing.  Abdulla Sheth was practically unlettered, but he had a rich fund of  experience. He had an acute intellect and was conscious of it. By  practice he had picked up just sufficient English for conversational  purposes, but that served him for carrying on all his business,  whether it was dealing with Bank Managers and European merchants or  explaining his case to his counsel. The Indians held him in very  high esteem. His firm was then the biggest, or at any rate one of  the biggest, of the Indian firms. With all these advantages he had  one disadvantage \u2013 he was by nature suspicious. He was proud of Islam and loved to discourse on Islamic philosophy.  Though he did not know Arabic, his acquaintance with the Holy Koran  and Islamic literature in general was fairly good. Illustrations he  had in plenty, always ready at hand. Contact with him gave me a fair  amount of practical knowledge of Islam. When we came closer to each  other, we had long discussions on religious topics. On the second or third day of my arrival, he took me to see the Durban court. There  he introduced me to several people and seated me next to his  attorney. The Magistrate kept staring at me and finally asked me to  take off my turban. This I refused to do and left the court. So here too there was fighting in store for me.  Abdulla Sheth explained to me why some Indians were required to take  off their turbans. Those wearing the Musalman costume might, he  said, keep their turbans on, but the other Indians on entering a  court had to take theirs off as a rule.  I must enter into some details to make this nice distinction  intelligible. In the course of these two or three days I could see  that the Indians were divided into different groups. One was that of  Musalman merchants, who would call themselves 'Arabs'. Another was  that of Hindu, and yet another of Parsi, clerks. The Hindu clerks  were neither here nor there, unless they cast in their lot with the  'Arabs'. The Parsi clerks would call themselves Persians. These three  classes had some social relations with one another. But by far the  largest class was that composed of Tamil, Telugu and North Indian  indentured and freed labourers. The indentured labourers were those  who went to natal on an agreement to serve for five years, and came  to be known there as girmitiyas from girmit, which was the corrupt form of the English word  'agreement'. The other three classes had none but business relations  with this class. Englishmen called them' coolies' and as the  majority of Indians belonged to the labouring class, all Indians  were called 'coolies,' or 'samis'. Sami  is a Tamil suffix occurring after many Tamil names, and it is  nothing else than the Samskrit Swami,  meaning a master. Whenever, therefore, an Indian resented being  addressed as a sami and had enough wit in him, he would try to return the compliment in  this wise: 'You may call me sami,  but you forget that sami means a master. I am not your master!' Some Englishmen would wince  at this, while others would get angry, swear at the Indian and, if  there was a chance, would even belabour him; for sami  to him was nothing better than a term of contempt. To interpret it  to mean a master amounted to an insult!  I was hence known as a 'coolie barrister'. The merchants were known as 'coolie merchants'.  The original meaning of the word 'coolie' was thus forgotten, and it  became a common appellation for all Indians. The Musalman merchant  would resent this and say: 'I am not a coolie, I am an Arab,' or 'I  am a merchant', and the Englishman, if courteous, would apologize to  him.  The question of wearing the turban had a great importance in this  state of things. Being obliged to take off one's Indian turban would  be pocketing an insult. So I thought I had better bid good-bye to  the Indian turban and begin wearing an English hat, which would save  me from the insult and the unpleasant controversy.  But Abdulla Sheth disapproved of the idea. He said, 'If you do  anything of the kind, it will have a very bad effect. You will  compromise those insisting on wearing Indian turbans. And an Indian  turban sits well on your head. If you wear an English hat, you will  pass for a waiter.'  There was practical wisdom, patriotism and a little bit of  narrowness in this advice. The wisdom was apparent, and he would not  have insisted on the Indian turban except out of patriotism; the  slighting reference to the waiter betrayed a kind of narrowness.  Amongst the indentured Indians there were three classes \u2013 Hindus, Musalmans and Christians. The last were the children of indentured  Indians who became converts to Christanity. Even in  their  number was large. They wore the English costume, and the majority  of them earned their living by service as waiters in hotels. Abdulla  Sheth's criticism of the English hat was with reference to this  class. It was considered degrading to serve as a waiter in a hotel.  The belief persists even today among many.  On the whole I liked Abdulla Sheth's advice. I wrote to the press about the incident and  defended the wearing of my turban in the court. The question was  very much discussed in the papers, which described me as an  'unwelcome visitor'. Thus the incident gave me an unexpected  advertisement in South Africa within a few days of my arrival there.  Some supported me while others severely criticized my temerity. My turban stayed with me practically until the end of my stay in  South Africa. When and why I left off wearing any head-dress at all  in South Africa, we shall see later.  When starting for South Africa I did not feel the wrench of separation  which I had experienced when leaving for England. My mother was now  no more. I had gained some knowledge of the world and of travel  abroad, and going from Rajkot to Bombay was no unusual affair. This time I only felt the pang of parting with my wife. Another baby  had been born to us since my return from England. Our love could not  yet be called free from lust, but it was getting gradually purer.  Since my return from Europe, we had lived very little together; and  as I had now become her teacher, however indifferent, and helped her  to make certain reforms, we both felt the necessity of being more  together, if only to continue the reforms. But the attraction of  South Africa rendered the separation bearable. 'We are bound to meet  again in a year,' I said to her, by way of consolation, and left Rajkot for Bombay. Here I was to get my passage through the agent of Dada Abdulla and  Co. But no berth was available on the boat, and if I did not  sail then, I should be stranded in Bombay. 'We have tried our best,'  said the agent, 'to secure a first-class passage, but in vain \u2013 unless  you are prepared to go on deck. Your meals can be arranged for in  the saloon.' Those were the days of my first class traveling, and  how could a barrister travel as a deck passenger? So I refused the  offer. I suspected the agent's veracity, for I could not believe  that a first class passage was not available. With the agent's  consent I set about securing it myself. I went on board the boat and  met the chief officer. He said to me quite frankly, 'We do not  usually have such a rush. But as the Governor-General of Mozambique  is going by this boat, all the berths are engaged.'  'Could you not possibly squeeze me in?' I asked.  He surveyed me from top to toe and smiled. 'There is just one way', he said. 'There is an  extra berth in my cabin, which is usually not available for  passengers. But I am prepared to give it to you.' I thanked him and  got the agent to purchase the passage. In April  I set forth  full of zest to try my luck in South Africa.  The first port of call was Lamu which we reached in about thirteen  days. The Captain and I had become great friends by this time. He  was fond of playing chess, but as he was quite a novice, he wanted  one still more of a beginner for his partner, and so he invited me.  I had heard a lot about the game but had never tried my hand at it.  Players used to say that this was a game in which there was plenty  of scope for the exercise of one's intelligence. The Captain offered  to give me lessons, and he found me a good pupil as I had unlimited  patience. Every time I was the loser, and that made him all the more  eager to teach me. I liked the game, but never carried my liking  beyond the boat or my knowledge beyond the moves of the pieces. At Lamu the ship remained at anchor for some three to four hours,  and I landed to see the port. The Captain had also gone ashore, but  he had warned me that the harbour was treacherous and that I should  return in good time.  It was a very small place. I went to the Post Office and was  delighted to see the Indian clerks there, and had a talk with them.  I also saw the Africans and tried to acquaint myself with their ways  of life which interested me very much. This took up some time. There were some deck passengers with whom I had made acquaintance,  and who had landed with a view to cooking their food on shore and  having a quiet meal. I now found them preparing to return to the  steamer, so we all got into the same boat. The tide was high in the  harbour and our boat had more than its proper load. The high current was  so strong that it was impossible to hold the boat to the ladder of  the steamer. It would just touch the ladder and be drawn away again  by the current. The first whistle to start had already gone. I was  worried. The Captain was witnessing our plight from the bridge. He  ordered the steamer to wait an extra five minutes. There was another  boat near the ship which a friend hired for me for ten rupees. This  boat picked me up from the overloaded one. The ladder had already  been raised. I had therefore to be drawn up by means of a rope and  the steamer started immediately. The other passengers were left  behind. I now appreciated the Captain's warning.  After Lamu the next port was Mombassa and then Zanzibar. The halt  here was a long one \u2013 eight or ten days \u2013 and we then changed to another  boat.  The Captain liked me much, but the liking took an undesirable turn.  He invited an English friend and me to accompany him on an outing,  and we all went ashore in his boat.\u00a0 I had not the least notion  of what the outing meant. And little did the Captain know  what an ignoramus I was in such matters. We were taken to some Negro  women's quarters by a tout. We were each shown into a room. I simply  stood there dumb with shame. Heaven only knows what the poor woman  must have thought of me. When the Captain called me I came out just  as I had gone in. He saw my innocence. At first I felt very  much ashamed, but as I could not think of the thing except with  horror, the sense of shame wore away, and I thanked God that the  sight of the woman had not moved me in the least. I was disgusted at  my weakness and pitied myself for not having had the courage to  refuse to go into the room.  This in my life was the third trial of  its kind. Many a youth, innocent at first, must have been drawn into  sin by a false sense of shame. I could claim no credit for having  come out unscathed.\u00a0 I could have credit if I had refused  to enter that room. I must entirely thank the All-merciful for  having saved me. The incident increased my faith in God and taught  me, to a certain extent, to cast off false shame.  As we had to remain in this port for a week, I took rooms in the  town and saw good deal by wandering about the neighbourhood. Only  Malabar can give any idea of the luxuriant vegetation of Zanzibar. I  was amazed at the gigantic trees and the size of the fruits. The next call was at Mozambique and thence we reached Natal towards  the close of May.  The next day at one o'clock I went to Mr. Baker's prayer-meeting. There  I was introduced to Miss Harris, Miss Gabb, Mr. Coates and others.  Everyone kneeled down to pray, and I followed suit. The prayers were  supplications to God for various things, according to each person's  desire. Thus the usual forms were for the day to be passed  peacefully, or for God to open the doors of the heart. A prayer was now added for my welfare: 'Lord, show the path to the  new brother who has come amongst us. Give him, Lord, the peace that  Thou hast given us. May the Lord Jesus who has saved us save him  too. We ask all this in the name of Jesus.' There was no singing of  hymns or other music at these meetings. After the supplication for  something special every day, we dispersed, each going to his lunch,  that being the hour for it. The prayer did not take more than five  minutes. The Misses Harris and Gabb were both elderly maiden ladies. Mr.  Coates was a Quaker. The two ladies lived together, and they gave me  a standing invitation to four o'clock tea at their house every  Sunday. When we met on Sundays, I used to give Mr. Coates my religious diary  for the week, and discuss with him the books I had read and the  impression they had left on me. The ladies used to narrate their  sweet experiences and talk about the peace they had found. Mr. Coates was a frank-hearted staunch young man. We went out for  walks together, and he also took me to other Christian friends. As we came closer to each other, he began to give me books of his own  choice, until my shelf was filled with them. He loaded me with  books, as it were. In pure faith I consented to read all those  books, and as I went on reading them we discussed them. I read a number of such books in . I do not remember the names  of them all, but they included the Commentary  of Dr. Parker of the City Temple, Pearson's  Many Infallible Proofs and Butler's Analogy.  Parts of these were unintelligible to me. I liked some things in  them, while I did not like others. Many Infallible Proofs were proofs in support of the religion of the Bible, as the author  understood it. The book had no effect on me. Parker's  Commentary was morally stimulating, but it could not be of any help to one who  had no faith in the prevalent Christian beliefs. Butler's  Analogy struck me to be a very profound and difficult book, which should be  read four or five times to be understood properly. It seemed to me  to be written with a view to converting atheists to theism. The  arguments advanced in it regarding the existence of God were  unnecessary for me, as I had then passed the stage of unbelief; but  the arguments in proof of Jesus being the only incarnation of God  and the Mediator between God and man left me unmoved. But Mr. Coates was not the man easily to accept defeat. He had great  affection for me. He saw, round my neck, the Vaishnava  necklace of Tulasi-beads. He thought it to be superstition and was  pained by it. 'This superstition does not become you. Come, let me  break the necklace.' 'No, you will not. It is a sacred gift from my mother.' 'But do you believe in it?' 'I do not know its mysterious significance. I do not think I should  come to harm if I did not wear it. But I cannot, without sufficient  reason, give up a necklace that she put round my neck out of love  and in the conviction that it would be conducive to my welfare.  When, with the passage of time, it wears away and breaks of its own  accord, I shall have no desire to get a new one. But this necklace  cannot be broken.' Mr. Coates could not appreciate my argument, as he had no regard for  my religion. He was looking forward to delivering me from the abyss  of ignorance. He wanted to convince me that, no matter whether there  was some truth in other religions, salvation was impossible for me  unless I accepted Christianity which represented the truth, and that  my sins would not be washed away except by the intercession of  Jesus, and that all good works were useless. Just as he introduced me to several books, he introduced me to  several friends whom he regarded as staunch Christians. One of these  introductions was to a family which belonged to the Plymouth  Brethren, a Christian sect. Many of the contacts for which Mr. Coates was responsible were good.  Most struck me as being God- fearing. But during my contact with this  family, one of the Plymouth Brethren confronted me with an argument  for which I was not prepared: 'You cannot understand the beauty of our religion. From what you say  it appears that you must be brooding over your transgressions every  moment of your life, always mending them and atoning for them. How  can this ceaseless cycle of action bring you redemption? You can  never have peace. You admit that we are all sinners. Now look at the  perfection of our belief. Our attempts at improvement and atonement  are futile. And yet redemption we must have. How can we bear the  burden of sin? We can but throw it on Jesus. He is the only sinless  Son of God. It is His word that those who believe in Him shall have  everlasting life. Therein lies God's infinite mercy. And as we  believe in the atonement of Jesus, our own sins do not bind us. Sin  we must. It is impossible to live in this world sinless. And  therefore Jesus suffered and atoned for all the sins of mankind.  Only he who accepts His great redemption can have eternal peace.  Think what a life of restlessness is yours, and what a promise of  peace we have.' The argument utterly failed to convince me. I humbly replied:  'If this be the Christianity acknowledged by all Christians, I  cannot accept it. I do not seek redemption from the consequences of  my sin. I seek to be redeemed from sin itself, or rather from the  very thought of sin. Until I have attained that end, I shall be  content to be restless.' To which the Plymouth Brother rejoined: I assure you, your attempt  is fruitless. Think again over what I have said.' And the Brother proved as good as his word. he knowingly committed  transgressions, and showed me that he was undisturbed by the thought  of them. But I already knew before meeting with these friends that all  Christians did not believe in such a theory of atonement. Mr. Coates  himself walked in the fear of God. His heart was pure, and he  believed in the possibility of self-purification. The two ladies  also shared this belief. Some of the books that came into my hands  were full of devotion. So, although Mr. Coates was very much  disturbed by this latest experience of mine, I was able to reassure  him and tell him that the distorted belief of a Plymouth Brother  could not prejudice me against Christianity. My difficulties lay elsewhere. They were with regard to the Bible  and its accepted interpretation.  Before writing further about Christian contacts, I must record other  experiences of the same period. Sheth Tyeb Haji Khan Muhammad had in Pretoria the same position as  was enjoyed by Dada Abdulla in Natal. There was no public movement  that could be conducted without him. I made his acquaintance the  very first week and told him of my intention to get in touch with  every Indian in Pretoria. I expressed a desire to study the  conditions of Indians there, and asked for his help in my work,  which he gladly agreed to give. My first step was to call a meeting of all the Indians in Pretoria  and to present to them a picture of their condition in the  Transvaal. The meeting was held at the house of Sheth Haji Muhammad  Haji Joosab, to whom I had a letter of introduction. It was  principally attended by Meman merchants, though there was a  sprinkling of Hindus as well. The Hindu population in Pretoria was,  as a matter of fact, very small. My speech at this meeting may be said to have been the first public  speech in my life. I went fairly prepared with my subject, which was  about observing truthfulness in business. I had always heard the  merchants say that truth was not possible in business. I did not  think so then, nor do I now. Even today there are merchant friends  who contend that truth is inconsistent with business. Business, they  say, is a very practical affair, and truth a matter of religion; and  they argue that practical affairs are one thing, while religion is quite another.  Pure truth, they hold, is out of the question in business, one can  speak it only so far as is suitable. I strongly contested the  position in my speech and awakened the merchants to a sense of their  duty, which was two-fold. Their responsibility to be truthful was  all the greater in a foreign land, because the conduct of a few  Indians was the measure of that of the millions of their  fellow-countrymen. I had found our peoples' habits to be insanitary, as compared with  those of the Englishmen around them, and drew their attention to it.  I laid stress on the necessity of forgetting all distinctions such  as Hindus, Musalmans, Parsis, Christians, Gujaratis, Madrasis,  Punjabis, Sindhis, Kachchhis, Surtis and so on. I suggested, in conclusion, the formation of an association to make  representations to the authorities concerned in respect of the  hardships of the Indian settlers, and offered to place at its  disposal as much of my time and service as was possible. I saw that I made a considerable impression on the meeting. My speech was followed by discussion. Some offered to supply me with  facts. I felt encouraged. I saw that very few amongst my audience  knew English. As I felt that knowledge of English would be useful in  that country, I advised those who had leisure to learn English. I told  them that it was possible to learn a language even at an advanced  age, and cited cases of people who had done so. I undertook,  besides, to teach a class, if one was started, or personally to  instruct individuals desiring to learn the language. The class was not started, but three young men expressed their  readiness to learn at their convenience, and on condition that I  went to their places to teach them. Of these, two were Musalmans \u2013 one of them a barber and the other a clerk \u2013  and the third was a Hindu, a  petty shopkeeper. I agreed to suit them all. I had no misgivings  regarding my capacity to teach. My pupils might become tired, but  not I. Sometimes it happened that I would go to their places only to  find them engaged in their business. But I did not lose patience.  None of the three desired a deep study of English, but two may be  said to have made fairly good progress in about eight months. Two  learnt enough to keep accounts and write ordinary business letters.  The barber's ambition was confined to acquiring just enough English  for dealing with his customers. As a result of their studies, two of  the pupils were equipped for making a fair income. I was satisfied with the result of the meeting. It was decided to  hold such meetings, as far as I remember, once a week or, maybe,  once a month. These were held more or less regularly, and on these  occasions there was a free exchange of ideas. The result was that  there was now in Pretoria no Indian I did not know, or whose  condition I was not acquainted with. This prompted me in turn to  make the acquaintance of the British Agent in Pretoria, Mr. Jacobus  de Wet. He had sympathy for the Indians, but he had very little  influence. However, he agreed to help us as best he could, and  invited me to meet him whenever I wished. I now communicated with the railway authorities and told them that,  even under their own regulations, the disabilities about travelling  under which the Indians laboured could not be justified. I got a  letter in reply to the effect that first and second class tickets  would be issued to Indians who were properly dressed. This was far  from giving adequate relief, as it rested with the station master to  decide who was 'properly dressed'. \u00a0The British Agent showed me some papers dealing with Indian affairs.  Tyeb Sheth had also given me similar papers. I learnt from them how  cruelly the Indians were hounded out from the Orange Free State. In short, my stay in Pretoria enabled me to make a deep study of the  social, economic and political condition of the Indians in the  Transvaal and the Orange Free State. I had no idea that this study  was to be of invaluable service to me in the future. For I had  thought of returning home by the end of the year, or even earlier,  if the case was finished before the year was out. But God disposed otherwise.  Sheth Haji Muhammad Haji Dada was regarded as the foremost leader of the  Indian community in Natal in . Financially Sheth Abdulla Haji  Adam was the chief among them, but he and others always gave the  first place to Sheth Haji Muhammad in public affairs. A meeting was,  therefore, held under his presidentship at the house of Abdulla  Sheth, at which it was resolved to offer opposition to the Franchise  Bill.  Volunteers were enrolled. Natal-born Indians, that is, mostly  Christian Indian youths, had been invited to attend this meeting. Mr.  Paul, the Durban court interpreter, and Mr. Subhan Godfrey,  headmaster of a mission school, were present, and it was they who  were responsible for bringing together at the meeting a good number  of Christian youths. All these enrolled themselves as volunteers. Many of the local merchants were of course enrolled, noteworthy  among them Sheths Dawud Muhammad, Muhammad Kasam Kamruddin, Adamji  Miyakhan, A. Kolandavellu Pillai, C. Lachhiram, Rangasami Padiachi,  and Amod Jiva. Parsi Rustomji was of course there. From among the  clerks were Messrs Manekji, Joshi, Narsinhram and others, employees  of Dada Abdulla and Co. and other big firms. They were all agreeably  surprised to find themselves taking a share in public work. To be  invited thus to take part was a new experience in their lives. In  face of the calamity that had overtaken the community, all  distinctions such as high and low, small and great, master and  servant, Hindus, Musalmans, Parsis, Christians, Gujaratis, Madrasis,  Sindhis, etc., were forgotten. All were alike the children and  servants of the motherland.  The bill had already passed, or was about to pass, its second  reading. In the speeches on the occasion the fact that Indians had  expressed no opposition the stringent bill was urged as proof of  their unfitness for the franchise.  I explained the situation to the meeting. The first thing we did was  to despatch a telegram to the Speaker of the Assembly requesting him  to postpone further discussion of the bill. A similar telegram was  sent to the premier, Sir John Robinson, and another to Mr. Escombe,  as a friend of Dada Abdulla's. The Speaker promptly replied that  discussion of the bill would be postponed for two days. This  gladdened our hearts.  The petition to be presented to the Legislative Assembly was drawn  up. Three copies had to be prepared and one extra was needed for the  press. It was also proposed to obtain as many signatures to it as  possible, and all this work had to be done in the course of a night.  The volunteers with a knowledge of English and several others sat up  the whole night. Mr. Arthur, an old man, who was known for his  calligraphy, wrote the principal copy. The rest were written by others  to someone's dictation. Five copies were thus got ready  simultaneously. Merchant volunteers went out in their own carriages,  or carriages whose hire they had paid, to obtain signatures to the  petition. This was accomplished in quick time and the petition was despatched. The newspapers published it with favourable  comments. It likewise created an impression on the Assembly. It was  discussed in the House. Partisans of the Bill offered a  defence \u2013 an admittedly lame one \u2013 in reply to the arguments advanced in the  petition. The ill, however, was passed. We all knew that this was a foregone conclusion, but the agitation had infused new life into the  community and had brought home to them the conviction that the  community was one and indivisible, and that it was as much their  duty to fight for its political rights as for its trading rights. Lord Ripon was at this time Secretary of State for the Colonies. It  was decided to submit to him a monster petition. This was no small  task and could not be done in a day. Volunteers were enlisted, and  all did their due share of the work.  I took considerable pains over drawing up this petition. I read all  the literature available on the subject. My argument centred round a  principle and on expedience. I argued that we had a right to the  franchise in Natal, as we had a kind of franchise in India. I urged  that it was expedient to retain it, as the Indian population capable  of using the franchise was very small.  Ten thousand signatures were obtained in the course of a fortnight.  To secure this number of signatures from the whole of the province  was no light task, especially when we consider that the men were  perfect strangers to the work. Specially competent volunteers had to  be selected for the work, as it had been decided not to take a  single signature without the signatory fully understanding the  petition. The villages were scattered at long distances. The work  could be done promptly only if a number of workers put their whole  heart into it. And this they did. All carried out their allotted  task with enthusiasm.\u00a0 But as I am writing these lines, figures of  Sheth Dawud Muhammad, Rustomji, Adamji Miyakhan, and  Amod Jiva rise clearly before my mind. They brought in the largest  number of signatures. Dawud Sheth kept going about in his carriage  the whole day. And it was all a labour of love, not one of them  asking for even his out-of-pocket expenses. Dada Abdulla's house  became at once a caravanserai and a public office. A number of  educated fiends who helped me and many others had their food there.  Thus every helper was put to considerable expense.  The petition was at last submitted. A thousand copies had been  printed for circulation and distribution. It acquainted the Indian  public for the first time with conditions in Natal. I sent copies to  all the newspapers and publicists I knew.  The Times of India,  in a leading article on the petition, strongly supported the Indian  demands. Copies were sent to journals and publicists in England  representing different parties. The London Times  supported our claims, and we began to entertain hopes of the bill  being vetoed.  It was now impossible for me to leave Natal. The Indian friends  surrounded me on all sides and importuned me to remain there  permanently. I expressed my difficulties. I had made up my mind not  to stay at public expense. I felt it necessary to set up an  independent household. I thought that the house should be good and  situated in a good locality. I also had the idea that I could not  add to the credit of the community, unless I lived in a  style usual for barristers. And it seemed to me to be impossible to  run such a household with anything less than \u00a3 a year. I therefore  decided that I could stay only if the members of the community  guaranteed legal work to the extent of that minimum, and I  communicated my decision to them.  'But,' said they, 'we should like you to draw that amount for public  work, and we can easily collect it. Of course, this is apart from the  fees you must charge for private legal work.'  'No, I could not thus charge you for public work,' said I. 'The work  would not involve the exercise on my part of much skill as  barrister. My work would be mainly to make you all work. And how  could I charge you for that? And then I should have to appeal to you  frequently for funds for the work, and if I were to draw my  maintenance from you, I should find myself at a disadvantage in  making an appeal for large amounts, and we should ultimately find  ourselves at a standstill. Besides I want the community to find more  than \u00a3 annually for public work.'  'But we have now known you for  some time, and are sure you would not draw anything you do not need.  And if we wanted you to stay here, should we not find your  expenses?'  'It is your love and present enthusiasm that make you talk like  this. How can we be sure that this love and enthusiasm will endure  for ever? And as your friend and servant, I should occasionally have  to say hard things to you. Heaven only knows whether I should then  retain your affection. But the fact is that I must not accept any  salary for public work. It is enough for me that you should all  agree to entrust me with your legal work. Even that may be hard for  you. For one thing I am not a white barrister. How can I be sure  that the court will respond to me? Nor can I be sure how I shall  fare as a lawyer. So even in giving me retainers you may be running  some risk. I should regard even the fact of your giving them to me  as the reward of my public work.'  The upshot of this discussion was that about twenty merchants gave  me retainers for one year for their legal work. Besides this, Dada  Abdulla purchased me the necessary furniture in lieu of a purse he  had intended to give me on my departure. Thus I settled in Natal.  The case having been concluded, I had no reason for staying in Pretoria.  So I went back to Durban and began to make preparations for my  return home. But Abdulla Sheth was not the man to let me sail  without a send-off. He gave a farewell party in my honour at  Sydenham. It was proposed to spend the whole day there. Whilst I was turning  over the sheets of some of the newspapers I found there, I chanced  to see a paragraph in a corner of one of them under the caption  'Indian Franchise'. It was with reference to the bill then before  the House of Legislature, which sought to deprive the Indians of  their right to elect members of the Natal Legislative Assembly. I  was ignorant of the bill, and so were the rest of the guests who had  assembled there. I inquired of Abdulla Sheth about it. He said: 'What can we  understand in these matters? We can only understand things that  affect our trade. As you know all our trade in the Orange Free State  has been swept away. We agitated about it, but in vain. We are after  all lame men, being unlettered. We generally take in newspapers  simply to ascertain the daily market rates, etc. What can we know of  legislation? Our eyes and ears are the European attorneys here.' 'But', said  I, 'there are so many young Indians born and educated here, Do they  not help you?' 'They!' exclaimed Abdulla Sheth in despair. 'They never care to come  to us, and to tell you the truth, we care less to recognize them.  Being Christians, they are under the thumb of the white clergymen,  who in their turn are subject to the Government.' This opened my eyes. I felt that this class should be claimed as our  own. Was this the meaning of Christianity? Did they cease to be  Indians because they had become Christians? But I was on the point of returning home and hesitated to express  what was passing through my mind in this matter. I simply said to  Abdulla Sheth: 'This bill, if it passes into law, will make our lot  extremely difficult. It is the first nail into our coffin. It  strikes at the root of our self-respect.' 'It may', echoed Sheth Abdulla. 'I will tell you the genesis of the  franchise question. We knew nothing about it. But Mr. Escombe, one  of our best attorneys, whom you know, put the idea into our heads.  It happened thus. He is a great fighter, and there being no love  lost between him and the Wharf Engineer, he feared that the  Engineer might deprive him of his votes and defeat him at the  election. So he acquainted us with our position, and at his instance  we all registered ourselves as voters, and voted for him. You will  now see how the franchise has not for us the value that you attach  to it. But we understand what you say. Well, then, what is your  advice?' The other guests were listening to this conversation with attention.  One of them said: 'Shall I tell you what should be done? You cancel  your passage by this boat, stay here a month longer, and we will  fight as you direct us.' All the others chimed in : 'Indeed, indeed. Abdulla Sheth, you must  detain Gandhibhai.' The Sheth was a shrewd man. He said: 'I may not detain him now. Or  rather, you have as much right as I to do so. But you are quite  right. Let us all persuade him to stay on. But you should remember  that he is a barrister. What about his fees?' The mention of fees pained me, and I broke in : 'Abdulla Sheth, fees  are out of the question. There can be no fees for public work. I can  stay, if at all, as a servant. And as you know, I am not acquainted  with all these friends. But if you believe that they will  co-operate, I am prepared to stay a month longer. There is one  thing, however. Though you need not pay me anything, work of the  nature we contemplate cannot be done without some funds to start  with. Thus we may have to send telegrams, we may have to print some  literature, some touring may have to be done, the local attorneys  may have to be consulted, and as I am ignorant of your laws, I may  need some law-books for reference. All this cannot be done without  money. And it is clear that one man is not enough for this work.  Many must come forward to help him.' And a chorus of voices was heard: 'Allah is great and merciful.  Money will come in. Men there are, as many as you may need. You  please consent to stay, and all will be well.' The farewell party was thus turned into a working committee. I  suggested finishing dinner etc. quickly and getting back home. I  worked out in my own mind an outline of the campaign. I ascertained  the names of those who were on the list of voters, and made up my  mind to stay on for a month. Thus God laid the foundations of my life in South Africa and sowed  the seed of the fight for national self-respect.  The symbol of a Court of justice is pair of scales held evenly by an  impartial and blind but sagacious woman. Fate has purposely made her  blind, in order that she may not judge a person from his exterior  but from his intrinsic worth. But the Law Society of Natal set out  to persuade the Supreme Court to act in contravention of this  principle and to belie its symbol.  I applied for admission as an advocate of the Supreme Court. I held  a certificate of admission from the Bombay High Court. The English  certificate I had to deposit with the Bombay High Court when I was  enrolled there. It was necessary to attach two certificates of  character to the application for admission, and thinking that these  would carry more weight if given by Europeans, I secured them from  two well-known European merchants whom I knew through Sheth Abdulla.  The application had to be presented through a member of the bar, and  as a rule the Attorney General presented such applications without  fees. Mr. Escombe, who, as we have seen, was legal adviser to  Messrs. Dada Abdulla & Co, was the Attorney General. I called on  him, and he willingly consented to present my application. The Law Society now sprang a surprise on me by serving me with a  notice opposing my application for admission. One of their  objections was that the original English certificate was not  attached to my application. But the main objection was that, when  the regulations regarding admission of advocates were made, the  possibility of a coloured man applying could not have been  contemplated. Natal owed its growth to European enterprise, and  therefore it was necessary that the European element should  predominate in the bar. If coloured people were admitted, they might  gradually outnumber the Europeans, and the bulwark of their  protection would break down.  The Law Society had engaged a distinguished lawyer to support their  opposition. As he too was connected with Dada Abdulla & Co., he sent  me word through Sheth Abdulla to go and see him. He talked with me  quite frankly, and inquired about my antecedents, which I gave. Then  he said:  'I have nothing to say against you. I was only afraid lest you  should be some colonial-born adventurer. And the fact that your  application was unaccompanied by the original certificate supported  my suspicion. There have been men who have made use of diplomas  which did not belong to them. The certificates of character from  European traders you have submitted have no value for me. What do  they know about you? What can be the extent of their acquaintance  with you?  'But,' said I, 'everyone here is a stranger to me. Even Sheth  Abdulla first came to know me here.'  'But then you say he belongs to the same place as you? It your  father was Prime Minister there, Sheth Abdulla is bound to know your  family. if you were to produce his affidavit, I should have  absolutely no objection. I would then gladly communicate to the Law  Society my inability to oppose your application.'  This talk enraged me, but I restrained my feelings. 'If I had  attached Dada Abdulla's certificate,' said I to myself, 'it would  have been rejected, and they would have asked for Europeans'  certificates. And what has my admission as advocate to do with my  birth and my antecedents? How could my birth, whether humble or  objectionable, be used against me?' But I contained myself and  quietly replied:  'Though I do not admit that the Law Society has any authority to  require all these details, I am quite prepared to present the  affidavit you desire.'  Sheth Abdulla's affidavit was prepared and duly submitted to the  counsel for the Law Society. He said he was satisfied. But not so  the Law Society. it opposed my application before the Supreme Court,  which ruled out the opposition without even calling upon Mr. Escombe  to reply. The Chief justice said in effect:  'The objection that the applicant has not attached the original  certificate has no substance. If he has made a false affifavit, he  can be prosecuted, and his name can then be struck off the roll, if  he is proved guilty. The law makes no distinction between white and  coloured people. The court has therefore no authority to prevent Mr.  Gandhi from being enrolled as an advocate. We admit his application.  Mr. Gandhi, you can now take the oath.'  I stood up and took the oath before the Registar. As soon as I was  sworn in, the Chief Justice, addressing me, said:  'You must now take off your turban, Mr. Gandhi. you must submit to  the rules of the court with regard to the dress to be worn by practising barristers.' I saw my limitations. The turban that I had insisted on wearing in  the District Magistrate's Court I took off in obedience to the order  of the Supreme Court. Not that, if I had resisted the order, the  resistance could not have been justified. But I wanted to reserve my  strength for fighting bigger battles. I should not exhaust my skill  as a fighter in insisting on retaining my turban. It was worthy of a  better cause.  Sheth Abdulla and other friends did not like my  submission (or was it weakness?). They felt that I should have stood  by my right to wear the turban while practising in the Court. I  tried to reason with them. I tried to press home to them the truth  of the maxim, 'When at Rome do as the Romans do.' 'It would be  right', I said, 'to refuse to obey, if in India an English officer  or judge ordered you to take off your turban; but as an officer of  the court, it would have ill become me to disregard a custom of the  court in the province of Natal.'  I pacified the friends somewhat with these and similar arguments,  but I do not think I convinced them completely, in this instance, of  the applicability of the principle of looking at a thing from a  different standpoint in different circumstances. But all my life  through, the very insistence on truth has taught me to appreciate the  beauty of compromise. I saw in later life that this spirit was an  essential part of Satyagraha. It has often meant endangering my life  and incurring the displeasure of friends. But truth is hard as  adamant and tender as a blossom.  The opposition of the Law Society gave me another advertisement in  South Africa. Most of the newspapers condemned the opposition and  accused the Law Society of jealousy. The advertisement, to some  extent, simplified my work.  From the very first day of my stay with him Gokhale made me feel  completely at home. He treated me as though I were his younger  brother; he acquainted himself with all my requirements and arranged  to see that I got all I needed. Fortunately my wants were few, and  as I had cultivated the habit of self-help, I needed very little personal  attendance. He was deeply impressed with my habit of fending for  myself, my personal cleanliness, perseverance and regularity, and  would often overwhelm me with praise.  He seemed to keep nothing private from me. He would introduce me to  all the important people that called on him. Of these the one who  stands foremost in my memory is Dr. (now Sir) P. C. Ray. He lived  practically next door and was a very frequent visitor.  This is how he introduced Dr. Ray: 'This is Professor Ray, who, having a  monthly salary of Rs. , keeps just Rs.  for himself and devotes  the balance to public purposes. He is not, and does not want to get,  married.  I see little difference between Dr. Ray as he is today and as he  used to be then. His dress used to be nearly as simple as it is,  with this difference of course, that whereas it is Khadi now, it used  to be Indian mill-cloth in those days. I felt I could never hear too  much of the talks between Gokhale and Dr. Ray, as they all pertained  to public good or were of educative value. At times they were  painful too, containing, as they did, strictures on public men. As a  result, some of those whom I had regarded as stalwart fighters began  to look quite puny.  To see Gokhale at work was as much a joy as an education. He never  wasted a minute. His private relations and friendships were all for  public good. All his talks had reference only to the good of the  country and were absolutely free from any trace of untruth or  insincerity. India's poverty and subjection were matters of constant  and intense concern to him. Various people sought to interest him in  different things. But he gave every one of them the same reply: 'You  do the thing yourself. Let me do my own work. What I want is freedom  for my country. After that is won, we can think of other things.  Today that one thing is enough to engage all my time and energy.' His reverence for Ranade could be seen every moment. Ranade's  authority was final in every matter, and he would cite it at every  step. The anniversary of Ranade's death (or birth, I forget which)  occurred during my stay with Gokhale, who observed it regularly.  There were with him then, besides myself, his friends Professor  Kathavate and a Sub-Judge. He invited us to take part in the  celebration, and in his speech he gave us his reminiscences of  Ranade. He compared incidentally Ranade, Telang and Mandlik. He  eulogized Telang's charming style and Mandlik's greatness as a  reformer. Citing an instance of Mandlik's solicitude for his  clients, he told us an anecdote as to how once, having missed his  usual train, he engaged a special train so as to be able to attend the court in the interest of his client. But Ranade,  he said, towered above them all, as a versatile genius. He was not  only a great judge, he was an equally great historian, economist  and reformer. Although he was a judge, he fearlessly attended the  Congress, and everyone had such confidence in his sagacity that they  unquestioningly accepted his decisions. Gokhale's joy knew no  bounds, as he described these qualities of head and heart which were  all combined in his master.  Gokhale used to have a horse-carriage in those days. I did not know  the circumstances that had made a horse-carriage a necessity for  him, and so I remonstrated with him: 'Can't you make use of the  tramcar in going about from place to place? Is it derogatory to a  leader's dignity?'  Slightly pained he said, 'So you also have failed to understand me!  I do not use my Council allowances for my own personal comforts. I  envy your liberty to go about in tramcars, but I am sorry I cannot  do likewise. When you are the victim of as wide a publicity as I am,  it will be difficult, if not impossible, for you to go about in a  tramcar. There is no reason to suppose that everything that the  leaders do is with a view to personal comfort. I love your simple  habits. I live as simply as I can, but some expense is almost  inevitable for a man like myself.'  He thus satisfactorily disposed of one of my complaints, but there  was another which he could not dispose of to my satisfaction. 'But you do not even go out for walks,' said I. 'Is it surprising  that you should be always ailing? Should public work leave no time  for physical exercise?'  'When do you ever find me free to go out for a walk?' he replied. I had such a great regard for Gokhale that I never strove with him.  Though this reply was far from satisfying me, I remained silent. I  believed then, and I believe even now, that, no matter what amount of  work one has, one should always find some time for exercise, just as one  does for one's meals. It is my humble opinion that, far from taking  away from one's capacity for work, it adds to it.  The terrible sacrifice offered to Kali in the name of religion enhanced  my desire to know Bengali life. I had read and heard a good deal  about the Brahmo Samaj. I knew something about the life of Pratap  Chandra Mazumdar. I had attended some of the meetings addressed by  him. I secured his life of Keshav Chandra Sen, read it with great  interest, and understood the distinction between Sadharan Brahmo  Samaj, and Adi Brahmo Samaj. I met Pandit Shivanath Shastri and in  company with Professor Kathavate went to see Maharshi Devendranath  Tagore; but as no interviews with him were allowed then, we could  not see him. We were, however, invited to a celebration of the Brahmo Samaj held at his place, and there we had the privilege of listening to fine Bengali music. Ever since I have been a lover of  Bengali music.  Having seen enough of the Brahmo Samaj, it was impossible to be  satisfied without seeing Swami Vivekanand. So with great enthusiasm  I went to Belur Math, mostly, or maybe all the way, on foot. I loved  the sequestered site of the Math. I was disappointed and sorry to be  told that the Swami was at his Calcutta house, lying ill, and could  not be seen.  I then ascertained the place of residence of Sister Nivedita, and  met her in a Chowringhee mansion. I was taken aback by the splendour  that surrounded her, and even in our conversation there was not much  meeting ground. I spoke to Gokhale about this, and he said he did  not wonder that there could be no point of contact between me and a  volatile person like her.  I met her again at Mr. Pestonji Padshah's place. I happened to come  in just as she was talking to his old mother, and so I became an  interpreter between the two. In spite of my failure to find any  agreement with her, I could not but notice and admire her  overflowing love for Hinduism. I came to know of her books later. I used to divide my day between seeing the leading people in  Calcutta regarding the work in South Africa, and visiting and  studying the religious and public institutions of the city. I once  addressed a meeting, presided over by Dr. Mullick, on the work of  the Indian Ambulance Corps in the Boer War. My acquaintance with  The Englishman stood me in good stead on this occasion too. Mr.  Saunders was ill then, but rendered me as much help as in . Gokhale liked this speech of mine, and he was very glad to hear Dr.  Ray praising it.  Thus my stay under the roof of Gokhale made my work  in Calcutta very easy, brought me into touch with the foremost  Bengali families, and was the beginning of my intimate contact with  Bengal.  I must needs skip over many a reminiscence of this memorable month.  Let me simply mention my flying visit to Burma, and the foongis  there. I was pained by their lethargy. I saw the golden pagoda. I  did not like the innumerable little candles burning in the temple,  and the rats running about the sanctum brought to my mind thoughts  of Swami Dayanand's experience at Morvi. The freedom and energy of  the Burmese women charmed just as the indolence of the men pained  me. I also saw, during my brief sojourn, that just as Bombay was not  India, Rangoon was not Burma, and that just as we in India have  become commission agents of English merchants, even so in Burma have  we combined with the English merchants, in making the Burmese people  our commission agents. On my return from Burma I took leave of Gokhale. The separation was  a wrench, but my work in Bengal, or rather Calcutta, was finished,  and I had no occasion to stay any longer.  Before settling down I had thought of making a tour through India  travelling third class, and acquainting myself with the hardships  of third class passengers. I spoke to Gokhale about this. To begin  with he ridiculed the idea, but when I explained to him what I hoped  to see, he cheerfully approved. I planned to go first to Benares to  pay my respects to Mrs. Besant, who was then ill.  It was necessary to equip myself anew for the third class tour.  Gokhale himself gave me a metal tiffin-box and got it filled with  sweet-balls and puris. I purchased a canvas bag worth twelve annas  and a long coat made of Chhaya wool. The bag was to contain this  coat, a dhoti, a towel and a shirt. I had a blanket as well to  cover myself with and a water-jug. Thus equipped I set forth on my  travels, Gokhale and Dr. Ray came to the station to see me off. I  had asked them both not to trouble to come, but they insisted. 'I  should not have come if you had gone first class, but now I had to,'  said Gokhale.  No one stopped Gokhale from going on to the platform. He was in his  silk turban, jacket and dhoti. Dr. Ray was in his Bengali dress.  He was stopped by the ticket collector, but on Gokhale telling him  that he was his friend, he was admitted.  Thus with their good wishes I started on my journey. Whilst living under Gokhlae's roof I was far from being a stay-at-home. I had told my Christian friends in South Africa that in India I  would meet the Christian Indians and acquaint myself with their  condition. I had heard of Babu Kalicharan Banerji and held him in  high regard. He took a prominent part in the Congress, and I had  none of the misgivings about him that I had about the average  Christian Indian, who stood aloof from the Congress and isolated  himself from Hindus and Musalmans. I told Gokhale that I was  thinking of meeting him. He said: 'What is good of your seeing him?  He is a very good man, but I am afraid he will not satisfy you. I  know him very well. However, you can certainly meet him if you  like?.'  I sought an appointment, which he readily gave me. When I  went, I found that his wife was on her death-bed. His house was  simple. In the Congress I had seen him in a coat and trousers, but I  was glad to find him now wearing a Bengal dhoti and shirt. I liked  his simple mode of dress, though I myself then wore a Parsi coat and  trousers. Without much ado I presented my difficulties to him. He  asked: 'Do you believe in the doctrine of original sin?'  'I do,' said I.  'Well then, Hinduism offers no absolution therefrom, Christianity  does;' and added: 'The wages of sin is death, and the Bible says that  the only way of deliverance is surrender unto Jesus.'  I put forward Bhakti-marga (the path of devotion) of the Bhagavad  Gita, but to no avail. I thanked him for his goodness. He  failed to satisfy me, but I benefited by the interview. During these days I walked up and down the streets of Calcutta. I  went to most places on foot. I met Justice Mitter and Sir Gurdas  Banerji, whose help I wanted in my work in South Africa. And about  this time I met Raja Sir Pyarimohan Mukarji.  Kalicharan Banerji had spoken to me about the Kali temple, which I  was eager to see, especially as I had read about it in books. So I  went there one day. Justice Mitter's house was in the same locality,  and I therefore went to the temple on the same day that I visited  him. On the way I saw a stream of sheep going to be sacrificed to  Kali. Rows of beggars lined the lane leading to the temple. There  were religious mendicants too, and even in those days I was sternly  opposed to giving alms to sturdy beggars. A crowd of them pursued  me. One of such men was found seated on a verandah. He stopped me,  and accosted me: 'Whither are you going, my boy?' I replied to him.` He asked my companion and me to sit down, which we did. I asked him: 'Do you regard this sacrifice as religion?' 'Who would regard killing of animals as religion?'  'Then, why don't you preach against it?'  'That's not my business. Our business is to worship God.' 'But could you not find any other place in which to worship God?' 'All places are equally good for us. The people are like a flock of  sheep, following where leaders lead them. It is no business of us sadhus.' We did not prolong the discussion but passed on to the temple. We  were greeted by rivers of blood. I could not bear to stand there. I  was exasperated and restless. I have never forgotten that sight. That very evening I had an invitation to dinner at a party of  Bengali friends. There I spoke to a friend about this cruel form of  worship. He said: 'The sheep don't feel anything. The noise and the  drum-beating there deaden all sensation of pain.'  I could not swallow this. I told him that, if the sheep had speech,  they would tell a different tale. I felt that the cruel custom ought  to be stopped. I thought of the story of Buddha, but I also saw that  the task was beyond my capacity.  I hold today the same opinion as I held  then. To my mind the life of a lamb is no less precious than that of  a human being. I should be unwilling to take the life of a lamb for  the sake of the human body. I hold that, the more helpless a  creature, the more entitled it is to protection by man from the  cruelty of man. But he who has not qualified himself for such  service is unable to afford to it any protection. I must go through  more self-purification and sacrifice, before I can hope to save  these lambs from this unholy sacrifice. It is my constant prayer  that there may be born on earth some great spirit, man or woman,  fired with divine pity, who will deliver us from this heinous sin,  save the lives of the innocent creatures, and purify the temple. How is it that Bengal  with all its knowledge, intelligence, sacrifice, and emotion  tolerates this slaughter?  By now I had been three years in South Africa. I had got to know the  people and they had got to know me. In  I asked permission to go  home for six months, for I saw that I was in for a long stay there.  I had established a fairly good practice, and could see that people  felt the need of my presence. So I made up my mind to go home, fetch  my wife and children, and then return and settle out there. I also  saw that, if I went home, I might be able to do there some public  work by educating public opinion and creating more interest in the  Indians of South Africa. The \u00a3 tax was an open sore. There could  be no peace until it was abolished.  But who was to take charge of the Congress work and Education  Society in my absence? I could think of two men \u2013 Adamji Miyakhan and  Parsi Rustomji. There were many workers now available from the  commercial class. But the foremost among those who could fulfill the  duties of the secretary by regular work, and who also commanded the  regard of the Indian community, were these two. The secretary  certainly needed a working knowledge of English. I recommended the  late Adamji Miyakhan's name to the Congress, and it approved of his  appointment as secretary. Experience showed that the choice was a  very happy one. Adamji Miyakhan satisfied all with his perseverance,  liberality, amiability and courtesy, and proved to every one that  the secretary's work did not require a man with a barrister's degree  or high English education. About the middle of  I sailed for home in the s. s. Pongola  which was bound for Calcutta.  There were very few passengers on board. Among them were two English  officers, with whom I came in close contact. With one of them I used  to play chess for an hour daily. The ship's doctor gave me a Tamil Self-Teacher  which I began to study. My experience in Natal had shown me that I  should acquire a knowledge of Urdu to get into closer contact with  the Musalmans, and of Tamil to get into closer touch with the Madras  Indians.  At the request of the English friend, who read Urdu with me, I found  out a good Urdu Munshi from among he deck passengers, and we made  excellent progress in our studies. The officer had a better memory  than I. He would never forget a word after once he had seen it; I  often found it difficult to decipher Urdu letters. I brought more  perseverance to bear, but could never overtake the officer. With Tamil I made fair progress. There was no help available, but  the Tamil Self-Teacher  was a well-written book, and I did not feel in need of much outside  help.  I had hoped to continue these studies even after reaching India, but  it was impossible. Most of my reading since  has been done in  jail. I did make some progress in Tamil and Urdu, in jails \u2013  Tamil in South African jails, and Urdu in Yeravda jail. But I never  learnt to speak Tamil, and the little I could do by way of reading  is now rusting away for want of practice. I still feel what a handicap this ignorance of Tamil or Telugu has  been. The affection that the Dravidians in South Africa showered on  me has remained a cherished memory. Whenever I see a Tamil or Telugu  friend, I cannot but recall the faith, perseverance and selfless  sacrifice of many of his compatriots in South Africa. And they were  mostly illiterate, the men no less than the women. The fight in  South Africa was for such, and it was fought by illiterate soldiers;  it was for the poor and the poor took their full share in it.  Ignorance of their language, however, was never a handicap to me in  stealing the hearts of these simple and good countrymen. They spoke  broken Hindustani or broken English, and we found no difficulty in  getting on with our work. But I wanted to requite their affection by  learning Tamil and Telugu. In Tamil, as I have said, I made some  little progress, but in Telugu, which I tried to learn in India, I  did not get beyond the alphabet. I fear now I can never learn these  languages, and am therefore hoping that the Dravidians will learn  Hindustani. The non-English-speaking among them in South Africa do  speak Hindi or Hindustani, however indifferently. It is only the  English-speaking ones who will not learn it, as though a knowledge  of English were an obstacle to learning our own languages. But I have digressed. Let me finish the narrative of my voyage. I  have to introduce to my readers the captain of the s .s. Poongola.  We had become friends. The good captain was a Plymouth Brother. Our  talks were more about spiritual subjects than nautical. He drew a  line between morality and faith. The teaching of the Bible was to  him child's play. Its beauty lay in its simplicity. Let all, men,  women and children, he would say, have faith in Jesus and his  sacrifice, and their sins were sure to be redeemed. This friend  revived my memory of the Plymouth Brother of Pretoria. The religion  that imposed any moral restrictions was to him no good.\u00a0 My  vegetarian food had been the occasion of the whole of this  discussion. Why should I not eat meat, or for that matter beef? Had  not God created all the lower animals for the enjoyment of mankind  as, for instance, He had created the vegetable kingdom? These  questions inevitably drew us into religious discussion. We could not convince each other. I was confirmed in my opinion that  religion and morality were synonymous. The captain had no doubt  about the correctness of his opposite conviction. At the end of twenty-four days the pleasant voyage came to a close,  and admiring the beauty of the Hooghly, I landed at Calcutta. The  same day I took the train for Bombay.  On my way to Bombay the train stopped at Allahabad for forty-five  minutes. I decided to utilize the interval for a drive through the  town. I also had to purchase some medicine at a chemist's shop. The  chemist was half asleep, and took an unconscionable time in  dispensing the medicine, with the result that when I reached the  station, the train had just started. The station master had kindly  detained the train one minute for my sake, but not seeing me coming,  had carefully ordered my luggage to be taken out of the train.  I took a room at Kellner's, and decided to start work there and  then. I had heard a good deal about The Pioneer  published from Allahabad, and I had understood it to be an opponent  of Indian aspirations. I have an impression that Mr. Chesney Jr. was  the editor at that time. I wanted to secure the help of every party,  so I wrote a note to Mr. Chesney, telling him how I had missed the  train, and asking for an appointment so as to enable me to leave the  next day. He immediately gave me one, at which I was very happy  especially when I found that he gave me a patient hearing. He  promised to notice in his paper anything that I might write, but  added that he could not promise to endorse all the Indian demands,  inasmuch as he was bound to understand and give due weight to the  viewpoint of the Colonials as well.  'It is enough,' I said, 'that you should study the question and  discuss it in your paper. I ask and desire nothing but the barest  justice that is due to us.'  The rest of the day was spent in having a look round admiring the  magnificent confluence of the three rivers, the 'Triveni' and planning the work before me. This unexpected interview with the editor of The Pioneer  laid the foundation of the series of incidents which ultimately led  to my being lynched in Natal.  I went straight to Rajkot without halting at Bombay and began to  make preparations for writing a pamphlet on the situation in South  Africa. The writing and publication of the pamphlet took about a  month. It had a green cover and came to be known afterwards as the  Green Pamphlet. In it I drew a purposely subdued picture of the  conditions of Indians in South Africa. The language I used was more  moderate than that of the two pamphlets which I have referred to  before, as I knew that things heard of from a distance appear bigger  than they are.  Ten thousand copies were printed and sent to all the papers and  leaders of every party in India. The Pioneer was the first to notice it editorially. A summary of the article was  cabled by Reuter to England, and a summary of that summary was  cabled to Natal by Reuter's London office. This cable was not longer  than three lines in print. It was a miniature, but exaggerated,  edition of the picture I had drawn of the treatment accorded to the  Indians in Natal, and it was not in my words. We shall see later on  the effect this had in Natal. In the meanwhile every paper of note  commented at length on the question.  To get these pamphlets ready for posting was no small matter. It  would have been expensive too, if I had employed paid help for  preparing wrappers, etc. But I hit upon a much simpler plan. I  gathered together all the children in my locality and asked them to  volunteer two or three hours' labour of a morning, when they had no  school. This they willingly agreed to do. I promised to bless them  and give them, as a reward, used postage stamps which I had  collected. They got through the work in no time. That was my first  experiment of having little children as volunteers. Two of those  little friends are my co-workers today.  Plague broke out in Bombay about this time, and there was panic all  around. There was fear of an outbreak in Rajkot. As I felt that I  could be of some help in the sanitation department, I offered my  services to the State. They were accepted, and I was put on the  committee which was appointed to look into the question. I laid  especial emphasis on the cleanliness of latrines, and the committee  decided to inspect these in every street. The poor people had no  objection to their latrines being inspected, and what is more, they  carried out the improvements suggested to them. But when we went to  inspect the houses of the upper ten, some of them even refused us  admission, not to talk of listening to our suggestions. It was our  common experience that the latrines of the rich were more unclean.  They were dark and stinking and reeking with filth and worms. The  improvements we suggested were quite simple, e.g., to have buckets  for excrement instead of allowing it to drop on the ground; to see  that urine also was collected in buckets, instead of allowing it to  soak into the ground, and to demolish the partitions between the  outer walls and the latrines, so as to give the latrines more light  and air and enable the scavenger to clean them properly. The  upper classes raised numerous objections to this last improvement,  and in most cases it was not carried out.  The committee had to  inspect untouchables' quarters also. Only one member of the  committee was ready to accompany me there. To the rest it was  something preposterous to visit those quarters, still more so to  inspect their latrines. But for me those quarters were an agreeable  surprise. That was the first visit in my life to such a locality.  The men and women there were surprised to see us. I asked them to  let us inspect their latrines.  'Latrines for us!' they exclaimed in astonishment. 'We go and  perform our functions out in the open. Latrines are for you big  people.'  'Well, then, you won't mind if we inspect your houses?' I asked. 'You are perfectly welcome, sir. You may see every nook and corner  of our houses. Ours are no houses, they are holes.'  I went in and was delighted to see that the insides were as clean as  the outsides. The entrances were well swept, the floors were  beautifully smeared with cow-dung, and the few pots and pans were  clean and shining. There was no fear of an outbreak in those  quarters.  In the upper class quarters we came across a latrine which I cannot  help describing in some detail. Every room had its gutter, which was  used both for water and urine, which meant that the whole house  would stink. But one of the houses had a storeyed bedroom with a  gutter which was being used both as a urinal and a latrine. The  gutter had a pipe discending to the ground floor. It was not  possible to stand the foul smell in this room. How the occupant  could sleep there I leave the readers to imagine.  The committee also visited the Vaishnava Haveli.  The priest in charge of the Haveli  was very friendly with my family. So he agreed to let us inspect  everything and suggest whatever improvements we liked. There was a  part of the Haveli premises that he himself had never seen. It was the place where  refuse and leaves used as dinner-plates used to be thrown over the  wall. It was the haunt of crows and kites. The latrines were of  course dirty. I was not long enough in Rajkot to see how many of our  suggestions the priest carried out.  It pained me to see so much uncleanliness about a place of worship.  One would expect a careful observance of the rules of sanitation and  hygiene in a place which is regarded as holy. The authors of the  Smritis, as I knew even then, have laid the greatest emphasis on  cleanliness both inward and outward.  Hardly ever have I known anybody to cherish such loyalty as I did to the  British Constitution. I can see now that my love of truth was at the  root of this loyalty. It has never been possible for me to simulate  loyalty or, for that matter, any other virtue. The National Anthem  used to be sung at every meeting that I attended in Natal. I then  felt that I must also join in the singing. Not that I was  unaware of the defects in British rule, but I thought it was on  the whole acceptable. In those days I believed that British rule was  on the whole beneficial to the ruled.  The colour prejudice that I saw in South Africa was, I thought, quite contrary to British  traditions, and I believed that it was only temporary and local. I  therefore vied with Englishmen in loyalty to the throne. With  careful perseverance I learnt the tune of the National Anthem and  joined in the singing whenever it was sung. Whenever there was an  occasion for the expression of loyalty without fuss or ostentation,  I readily took part in it.  Never in my life did I exploit this loyalty, never did I seek to  gain a selfish end by its means. It was for me more in the nature of  an obligation, and I rendered it without expecting a reward. Preparations were going on for the celebration of Queen Victoria's  Diamond Jubilee when I reached India. I was invited to join the  committee appointed for the purpose in Rajkot. I accepted the offer,  but had a suspicion that the celebrations would be largely a matter  of show. I discovered much humbug about them and was considerably  pained. I began to ask myself whether I should remain on the  committee or not, but ultimately decided to rest content with doing  my part of the business.  One of the proposals was to plant trees. I saw that many did it  merely for show and for pleasing the officials. I tried to plead  with them that tree-planting was not compulsory, but merely a  suggestion. It should be done seriously or not at all. I have an  impression that they laughed at my ideas. I remember that I was in  earnest when I planted the tree allotted to me and that I carefully  watered and tended it.  I likewise taught the National Anthem to the children of my family.  I recollect having taught it to students of the local Training  College, but I forget whether it was on the occasion of the jubilee  or of King Edward VII's coronation as Emperor of India. Later on the  text began to jar on me. As my conception of Ahimsa  went on maturing, I became more vigilant about my thought and  speech. The lines in the Anthem:  On the very day after my brother-in-law's death I had to go to Bombay  for the public meeting. There had hardly been time for me to think  out my speech. I was feeling exhausted after days and nights of  anxious vigil, and my voice had become husky. However, I went to  Bombay trusting entirely to God. I had never dreamt of writing out  my speech. In accordance with Sir Pherozeshah's instructions I reported myself  at his office at  P. M. on the eve of the meeting. 'Is your speech ready, Gandhi?' he asked. 'No, sir,' said I, trembling with fear, 'I think of speaking ex tempore.' 'That will not do in Bombay. Reporting here is bad, and if we would  benefit by this meeting, you should write out your speech, and it  should be printed before daybreak tomorrow. I hope you can manage  this?' I felt rather nervous, but I said I would try. 'Then, tell me, what time should Mr. Munshi\u00a0 come to you for the  manuscript?' 'Eleven o'clock tonight,' said I. On going to the meeting the next day, I saw the wisdom of Sir  Pherozeshah's advice. The meeting was held in the hall of the Sir  Cowasji Jehangir Institute. I had heard that when Sir Pherozeshah  Mehta addressed meetings the hall was always packed \u2013 chiefly by the students intent on hearing him \u2013 leaving not an inch of room. This  was the first meeting of the kind in my experience. I saw that my  voice could reach only a few. I was trembling as I began to read my  speech. Sir Pherozeshah cheered me up continually by asking me to  speak louder and still louder. I have a feeling that, far from  encouraging me, it made my voice sink lower and lower. My old friend Sjt. Keshavrao Deshpande came to my rescue. I handed  my speech to him. His was just the proper voice. But the audience  refused to listen. The hall rang with the cries of 'Wacha,' 'Wacha.'  So Mr. Wacha stood up and read the speech, with wonderful results.  The audience became perfectly quiet, and listened to the speech to  the end, punctuating it with applause and cries of 'shame' where  necessary. This gladdened my heart. Sir Pherozeshah liked the speech. I was supremely happy. The meeting won me the active sympathy of Sjt. Deshpande and a Parsi  friend, whose name I hesitate to mention, as he is a high-placed  Government official today. Both expressed their resolve to accompany  me to South Africa. Mr. C. M. Cursetji, who was then Small Causes  Court Judge, however, moved the Parsi friend from his resolve as he  had plotted his marriage. He had to choose between marriage and  going to South Africa, and he chose the former. But Parsi Rustomji  made amends for the broken resolve, and a number of Parsi sisters  are now making amends for the lady who helped in the breach, by  dedicating themselves to khadi work. I have therefore gladly  forgiven that couple. Sjt. Deshpande had no temptations of marriage,  but he too could not come. Today he is himself doing enough  reparation for the broken pledge. On my way back to South Africa I  met one of the Tyabjis at Zanzibar. He also promised to come and  help me, but never came. Mr. Abbas Tyabji is atoning for that  offence. Thus none of my three attempts to induce barristers to go  to South Africa bore any fruit. In this connection I remember Mr. Pestonji Padshah. I had been on  friendly terms with him ever since my stay in England. I first met  him in a vegetarian restaurant in London. I knew of his brother Mr.  Barjorji Padshah by his reputation as a 'crank'. I had never met  him, but friends said that he was eccentric. Out of pity for the  horses he would not ride in tramcars, he refused to take degrees in  spite of a prodigious memory, he had developed an independent  spirit, and he was a vegetarian, though a Parsi. Pestonji had not  quite this reputation, but he was famous for his erudition even in  London. The common factor between us, however, was vegetarianism,  and not scholarship, in which it was beyond my power to approach him. I found him out again in Bombay. He was Protonotary in the High  Court. When I met him he was engaged on his contribution to a Higher  Gujarati Dictonary. There was not a friend I had not approached for  help in my South African work. Pestonji Padshah, however, not only  refused to aid me, but even advised me not to return to South  Africa. 'It is impossible to help you,' he said. 'But I tell you I do not  like even your going to South Africa. Is there lack of work in our country? Look,  now, there is not a little to do for our language. I have to find  out scientific words. But this is only one branch of the work. Think  of the poverty of the land. Our people in South Africa are no doubt  in difficulty, but I do not want a man like you to be sacrificed for  that work. Let us win self-government here, and we shall  automatically help our countrymen there. I know I cannot prevail  upon you, but I will not encourage anyone of your type to throw in  his lot with you.' I did not like this advice, but it increased my regard for Mr.  Pestonji Padshah. I was struck with his love for the country and for  the mother tongue. The incident brought us closer to each other. I  could understand his point of view. But far from giving up my work  in South Africa, I became firmer in my resolve. A patriot cannot  afford to ignore any branch of service to the motherland. And for me  the text of the Gita was clear and emphatic: To set up a household was no new experience for me. But the  establishment in Natal was different from the ones that I had had in  Bombay and London. This time part of the expense was solely for the  sake of prestige. I thought it necessary to have a household in  keeping with my position as an Indian barrister in Natal and as a  representative. So I had a nice little house in a prominent  locality. It was also suitably furnished. Food was simple, but as I  used to invite English friends and Indian co-workers, the  housekeeping bills were always fairly high.  A good servant is essential in every household. But I have never  known how to keep anyone as a servant.  I had a friend as companion and help, and a cook who had become a  member of the family. I also had office clerks boarding and lodging  with me.  I think I had a fair amount of success in this experiment, but it  was not without its modicum of the bitter experiences of life. The companion was very clever and, I thought, faithful to me. But in  this I was deceived. He became jealous of an office clerk who was  staying with me, and wove such a tangled web that I suspected the  clerk. This clerical friend had a temper of his own. Immediately he  saw that he had been the object of my suspicion, he left both the  house and the office. I was pained. I felt that perhaps I had been  unjust to him, and my conscience always stung me.  In the meanwhile, the cook needed a few days' leave, or for some  other cause was away. It was necessary to procure another during his  absence. Of this new man I learnt later that he was a perfect scamp.  But for me he proved a godsend. Within two or three days of his  arrival, he discovered certain irregularities that were going on  under my roof without my knowledge, and he made up his mind to warn  me. I had the reputation of being a credulous but straight man. The  discovery was to him, therefore, all the more shocking. Every day at  one o'clock I used to go home from office for lunch. At about twelve  o'clock one day the cook came panting to the office, and said,  'Please come home at once. There is a surprise for you.' 'Now, what  is this?' I asked. 'You must tell me what it is. How can I leave the  office at this hour to go and see it?'  'You will regret it, if you don't come. That is all I can say.'  I felt an appeal in his persistence. I went home accompanied by a  clerk and the cook who walked ahead of us. He took me straight to  the upper floor, pointed at my companion's room, and said, 'Open  this door and see for yourself.'  I saw it all. I knocked at the door. No reply! I knocked heavily so  as to make the very walls shake. The door was opened. I saw a  prostitute inside. I asked her to leave the house, never to return.  To the companion I said, 'From this moment I cease to have anything  to do with you. I have been thoroughly deceived and have made a fool  of myself. That is how you have requited my trust in you?' Instead of coming to his senses, he threatened to expose me. 'I have nothing to conceal,' said I, 'Expose whatever I may have  done. But you must leave me this moment.'  This made him worse. There was no help for it. So I said to the  clerk standing downstairs: 'Please go and inform the police  superintendent, with my compliments, that a person living with me  has misbehaved himself. I do not want to keep him in my house, but  he refuses to leave. I shall be much obliged if police help can be  sent me.'  This showed him that I was in earnest. His guilt unnerved him. He  apologized to me, entreated me not to inform the police, and agreed  to leave the house immediately, which he did.  The incident came as a timely warning in my life. Only now could I  see clearly how thoroughly I had been beguiled by this evil genius.  In harbouring him I had chosen a bad means for a good end. I had  expected to 'gather figs of thistles'. I had known that the companion  was a bad character, and yet I believed in his faithfulness to me.  In the attempt to reform him I was near ruining myself. I had  disregarded the warning of kind friends. Infatuation had completely  blinded me.  But for the new cook I should never have discovered the truth and  being under the influence of the companion, I should probably have  been unable to lead the life of detachment that I then began. I  should always have been wasting time on him. He had the power to  keep me in the dark and to mislead me.  But God came to the rescue as before. My intentions were pure, and  so I was saved in spite of my mistakes, and this early experience  thoroughly forewarned me for the future.  The cook had been almost a messenger sent from Heaven. He did not  know cooking, and as a cook he could not have remained at my place.  But no one else could have opened my eyes. This was not the first  time, as I subsequently learnt, that the woman had been brought into  my house. She had come often before, but no one had the courage of  this cook. For everyone knew how blindly I trusted the companion.  The cook had, as it were, been sent to me just to do this service,  for he begged leave of me that very moment.  'I cannot stay in your house,' he said. 'You are so easily misled.  This is no place for me.'  I let him go.  I soon discovered that the man who had poisoned my ears against the  clerk was no other than this companion. I tried very hard to make  amends to the clerk for the injustice I had done him. It has,  however, been my eternal regret that I could never satisfy him  fully. Howsoever you may repair it, a rift is a rift  Sir Pherozeshah had made my way easy. So from Bombay I went to Poona.  Here there were two parties. I wanted the help of people of every  shade of opinion. First I met Lokamanya Tilak. He said:  'You are quite right in seeking the help of all parties. There can  be no difference of opinion on the South African question. But you  must have a non-party man for your president. Meet Professor  Bhandarkar. He has been taking no part of late in any public  movement. But this question might possibly draw him out. See him and  let me know what he says. I want to help you to the fullest extent.  Of course you will meet me whenever you like. I am at your  disposal.' This was my first meeting with the Lokamanya. It revealed to me the  secret of his unique popularity. Next I met Gokhale. I found him on the Fergusson College grounds. He  gave me an affectionate welcome, and his manner immediately won my  heart. With him too this was my first meeting, and yet it seemed as  though we were renewing an old friendship. Sir Pherozeshah had  seemed to me like the Himalaya, the Lokamanya like the ocean. But  Gokhale was as the Ganges. One could have a refreshing bath in the  holy river. The Himalaya was unscaleable, and one could not easily  launch forth on the sea, but the Ganges invited one to its bosom. It  was a joy to be on it with a boat and an oar. Gokhale closely  examined me, as a schoolmaster would examine a candidate seeking  admission to a school. He told me whom to approach and how to  approach them. He asked to have a look at my speech. He showed me  over the college, assured me that he was always at my disposal,  asked me to let him know the result of the interview with Dr. Bhandarkar, and sent me away exultantly happy. In the sphere of  politics the place that Gokhale occupied in my heart during his  lifetime and occupies even now was and is absolutely unique. Dr. Bhandarkar received me with the warmth of a father. It was noon  when I called on him. The very fact that I was busy seeing people at  that hour appealed greatly to this indefatigable savant, and my  insistence on a non-party man for the president of the meeting had  his ready approval, which was expressed in the spontaneous  exclamation, 'That's it,' 'that's it.' After he had heard me out he said: 'Anyone will tell you that I do  not take part in politics. But I cannot refuse you. Your case is so  strong and your industry is so admirable that I cannot decline to  take part in your meeting. You did well in consulting Tilak and  Gokhale. Please tell them that I shall be glad to preside over the  meeting to be held under the joint auspices of the two Sabhas. You  need not have the time of the meeting from me. Any time that suits  them will suit me.' With this he bade me good-bye with  congratulations and blessings. Without any ado this erudite and selfless band of workers in Poona  held a meeting in an unostentatious little place, and sent me away  rejoicing and more confident of my mission. I next proceeded to Madras. It was wild with enthusiasm. The  Balasundaram incident made a profound impression on the meeting. My  speech was printed and was, for me, fairly long. But the audience  listened to every word with attention. At the close of the meeting  there was a regular run on the 'Green Pamphlet.' I brought out a  second and revised edition of , copies. They sold like hot  cakes, but I saw that it was not necessary to print such a large  number. In my enthusiasm I had overcalculated the demand. It was the  English-speaking public to which my speech had been addressed, and  in Madras that class alone could not take the whole ten thousand. The greatest help here came to me from the late Sjt. G.  Parameshvaran Pillay, the editor of The Madras Standard. He had made a careful study of the question, and he often invited me  to his office and gave me guidance. Sjt. G. Subrahmaniam of The Hindu  and Dr. Subrahmaniam also were very sympathetic. But Sjt. G.  Parameshvaran Pillay placed the columns of The Madras Standard  entirely at my disposal, and I freely availed myself of the offer.  The meeting in Pachaiappa's Hall, so far as I can recollect, was  with Dr. Subrahmaniam in the chair. The affection showered on me by most of the friends I met and their  enthusiasm for the cause were so great that, in spite of my having  to communicate with them in English, I felt myself entirely at home.  What barrier is there that love cannot break?  From Madras I proceeded to Calcutta where I found myself hemmed by  difficulties. I knew no one there. So I took a room in the Great  Eastern Hotel. Here I became acquainted with Mr. Ellerthorpe, a  representative of The Daily Telegraph.  He invited me to the Bengal Club, where he was staying. He did not  then realize that an Indian could not be taken to the drawing-room  of the club. Having discovered the restriction, he took me to his  room. He expressed his sorrow regarding this prejudice of the local  Englishmen and apologized to me for not having been able to take me  to the drawing-room.  I had of course to see Surendranath Banerji, the 'Idol of Bengal'.  When I met him, he was surrounded by a number of friends. He said:  'I am afraid people will not take interest in your work. As you  know, our difficulties here are by no means few. But you must try as  best you can. You will have to enlist the sympathy of Maharajas.  Mind you meet the representatives of the British Indian  Association. You should meet Raja Sir Pyarimohan Mukarji and  Maharaja Tagore. Both are liberal-minded and take a fair share in  public work.'  I met these gentlemen, but without success. Both gave me a cold  reception and said it was no easy thing to call a public in Calcutta, and if anything could be done, it would  practically all depend on Surendranath Banerji.  I saw that my task was becoming more and more difficult. I called at the office of The Amrita Bazar Patrika.  The gentleman whom I met there took me to be a wandering Jew.  The Bangabasi went even one better. The editor kept me waiting for an hour. He had  evidently many interviewers, but he would not so much as look at me,  even when he had disposed of the rest. On my venturing to broach my  subject after the long wait, he said: 'Don't you see our hands are  full? There is no end to the number of visitors like you. You had  better go. I am not disposed to listen to you.' For a moment I felt  offended, but I quickly understood the editor's position. I had  heard of the fame of The Bangabasi.  I could see that there was a regular stream of visitors there. And  they were all people acquainted with him. His paper had no lack of  topics to discuss, and South Africa was hardly known at that time. However serious a grievance may be in the eyes of the man who  suffers from it, he will be but one of the numerous people invading  the editor's office, each with a grievance of his own. How is the  editor to meet them all? Moreover, the aggrieved party imagines that  the editor is a power in the land. Only he knows that his powers can  hardly travel beyond the threshold of his office. But I was not  discouraged. I kept on seeing editors of other papers. As usual I  met the Anglo-Indian editors also.  The Statesman and The Englishman  realized the importance of the question. I gave them long  interviews, and they published them in full.  Mr. Saunders, editor of The Englishman,  claimed me as his own. He placed his office and paper at my  disposal. He even allowed me the liberty of making whatever changes  I liked in the leading article he had written on the situation, the  proof of which he sent me in advance. It is no exaggeration to say  that a friendship grew up between us. He promised to render me all  the help he could, carried out the promise to the letter, and kept  on his correspondence with me until the time when he was seriously  ill.  Throughout my life I have had the privilege of many such  friendships, which have sprung up quite unexpectedly. What Mr.  Saunders liked in me was my freedom from exaggeration and my  devotion to truth. He subjected me to a searching cross-examination  before he began to sympathize with my cause, and he saw that I had  spared neither will nor pains to place before him an impartial  statement of the case even of the white man in South Africa and also  to appreciate it.  My experience has shown me that we win justice quickest by rendering  justice to the other party.  The unexpected help of Mr. Saunders had begun to encourage me to  think that I might succeed after all in holding a public meeting in  Calcutta, when I received the following cable from Durban:  'Parliament opens January. Return soon.'  So I addressed a letter to the press, in which I explained why I had  to leave Calcutta so abruptly, and set off for Bombay. Before  starting I wired to the Bombay agent of Dada Abdulla & Co., to  arrange for my passage by the first possible boat to South Africa.  Dada Abdulla had just then purchased the steamship Courland  and insisted on my travelling on that boat, offering to take me and  my family free of charge. I gratefully accepted the offer, and in  the beginning of December set sail a second time for South Africa,  now with my wife and two sons and the only son of my widowed sister.  Another steamship Naderi also sailed for Durban at the same time. The agents of the Company  were Dada Abdulla & Co. The total number of passengers these boats  carried must have been about eight hundred, half of whom were bound  for the Transvaal.  Even after I thought I had settled down in Johannesburg, there was to be  no settled life for me. Just when I felt that I should be breathing  in peace, an unexpected event happened. The papers brought the news  of the out break of the Zulu 'rebellion' in Natal. I bore no grudge  against the Zulus, they had harmed no Indian. I had doubts about the  'rebellion' itself. But I then believed that the British Empire  existed for the welfare of the world. A genuine sense of loyalty  prevented me from even wishing ill to the Empire. The rightness or  otherwise of the 'rebellion' was therefore not likely to affect my  decision. Natal had a Volunteer Defence Force, and it was open to it  to recruit more men. I read that this force had already been  mobilized to quell the 'rebellion'.  I considered myself a citizen of Natal, being intimately connected  with it. So I wrote to the Governor, expressing my readiness, if  necessary, to form an Indian Ambulance Corps. He replied immediately  accepting the offer.  I had not expected such prompt acceptance. Fortunately I had made  all the necessary arrangements even before writing the letter. If my  offer was accepted, I had decided to break up the Johannesburg home.  Polak was to have a smaller house, and my wife was to go and settle  at Phoenix. I had her full consent to this decision. I do not  remember her having ever stood in my way in matters like this. As  soon, therefore, as I got the reply from the Governor, I gave the  landlord the usual month's notice of vacating the house, sent some  of the things to Phoenix and left some with Polak.  I went to Durban and appealed for men. A big contingent was not  necessary. We were a party of twenty-four, of whom, besides me, four  were Gujaratis. The rest were ex-indentured men from South India,  excepting one who was a free Pathan.  In order to give me a status and to facilitate work, as also in  accordance with the existing convention, the Chief Medical Officer  appointed me to the temporary rank of Sergeant Major and three men  selected by me to the rank of sergeants and one to that of corporal.  We also received our uniforms from the Government. Our Corps was on  active service for nearly six weeks. On reaching the scene of the  'rebellion', I saw that there was nothing there to justify the name  of 'rebellion'. There was no resistance that one could see. The  reason why the disturbance had been magnified into a rebellion was  that a Zulu chief had advised non-payment of a new tax imposed on  his people, and had assagaied a sergeant who had gone to collect the  tax. At any rate my heart was with the Zulus, and I was delighted,  on reaching headquarters, to hear that our main work was to be the  nursing of the wounded Zulus. The Medical Officer in charge welcomed  us. He said the white people were not willing nurses for the wounded  Zulus, that their wounds were festering, and that he was at his  wits' end. He hailed our arrival as a godsend for those innocent  people, and he equipped us with bandages, disinfectants, etc., and  took us to the improvised hospital. The Zulus were delighted to see  us. The white soldiers used to peep through the railings that  separated us from them and tried to dissuade us from attending to  the wounds. And as we would not heed them, they became enraged and  poured unspeakable abuse on the Zulus.  Gradually I came into closer touch with these soldiers, and they  ceased to interfere. Among the commanding officers were Colonel Sparks  and Colonel Wylie, who had bitterly opposed me in . They were  surprised at my attitude and specially called and thanked me. They  introduced me to General Mackenzie. Let not the reader think that  these were professional soldiers. Colonel Wylie was a well-known Durban  lawyer. Colonel Sparks was well-known as the owner of a butcher's shop  in Durban. General Mackenzie was a noted Natal farmer. All these  gentlemen were volunteers, and as such had received military  training and experience.  The wounded in our charge were not wounded in battle. A section of  them had been taken prisoners as suspects. The General had sentenced  them to be flogged. The flogging had caused severe sores. These,  being unattended to, were festering. The others were Zulu friendlies.  Although these had badges given them to distinguish them from the  'enemy', they had been shot at by the soldiers by mistake.  Besides this work I had to compound and dispense prescriptions for  the white soldiers. This was easy enough for me as I had received a  year's training in Dr. Booth's little hospital. This work brought me  in close contact with many Europeans.  We were attached to a swift-moving column. It had orders to march  wherever danger was reported. It was for the most part mounted  infantry. As soon as our camp was moved, we had to follow on foot  with our stretchers on our shoulders. Twice or thrice we had to  march forty miles a day. But wherever we went, I am thankful that we  had God's good work to do, having to carry to the camp on our  stretchers those Zulu friendlies who had been inadvertently wounded,  and to attend upon them as nurses.  I had now given up all hope of returning to India in the near future.  I had promised my wife that I would return home within a year. The  year was gone without any prospect of my return, so I decided to  send for her and the children.  On the boat bringing them to South Africa, Ramdas, my third son,  broke his arm while playing with the ship's captain. The captain  looked after him well and had him attended to by the ship's doctor.  Ramdas landed with his hand in a sling. The doctor had advised that,  as soon as we reached home, the wound should be dressed by a  qualified doctor. But this was the time when I was full of faith in  my experiments in earth treatment. I had even succeeded in  persuading some of my clients who had faith in my quackery to try  the earth and water treatment.  What then was I to do for Ramdas? He was just eight years old. I  asked him if he would mind my dressing his wound. With a smile he  said he did not mind at all. It was not possible for him at that age  to decide what was the best thing for him, but he knew very well the  distinction between quackery and proper medical treatment. And he  knew my habit of home treatment and had faith enough to trust  himself to me. In fear and trembling I undid the bandage, washed the  wound, applied a clean earth poultice and tied the arm up again.  This sort of dressing went on daily for about a month until the  wound was completely healed. There was no hitch, and the wound took  no more time to heal than the ship's doctor had said it would under  the usual treatment.  This and other experiments enhanced my faith in such household  remedies, and I now proceeded with them with more self-confidence. I  widened the sphere of their application, trying the earth and water  and fasting treatment in cases of wounds, fevers, dyspepsia,  jaundice and other complaints, with success on most occasions. But  nowadays I have not the confidence I had in South Africa, and  experience has even shown that these experiments involve obvious  risks.  The reference here, therefore, to these experiments is not meant to  demonstrate their success. I cannot claim complete success for any  experiment. Even medical men can make no such claim for their  experiments. My object is only to show that he who would go in for  novel experiments must begin with himself. That leads to a quicker  discovery of truth, and God always protects the honest experimenter. The risks involved in experiments in cultivating intimate contacts  with Europeans were as grave as those in the nature cure  experiments. Only those risks were of a different kind. But in  cultivating those contacts I never so much as thought of the risks.  I invited Polak to come and stay with me, and we began to live like  blood brothers. The lady who was soon to be Mrs. Polak and he had  been engaged for some years, but the marriage had been postponed for  a propitious time. I have an impression that Polak wanted to put  some money by before he settled down to a married life. He knew  Ruskin much better than I, but his Western surroundings were a bar  against his translating Ruskin's teaching immediately into practice.  But I pleaded with him: 'When there is a heart union, as in your  case, it is hardly right to postpone marriage merely for financial  considerations. If poverty is a bar, poor men can never marry. And  then you are now staying with me. There is no question of household  expenses. I think you should get married as soon as possible.' As I  have said in a previous chapter, I had never to argue a thing twice  with Polak. He appreciated the force of my argument, and immediately  opened correspondence on the subject with Mrs. Polak, who was then  in England. She gladly accepted the proposal and in a few months  reached Johannesburg. Any expense over the wedding was out of the  question, not even a special dress was thought necessary. They  needed no religious rites to seal the bond. Mrs. Polak was a  Christian by birth and Polak a Jew. Their common religion was the  religion of ethics.  I may mention in passing an amusing incident in connection with this  wedding. The Registrar of European marriages in the Transvaal could  not register between black or coloured people. In the wedding in  question, I acted as the best man. Not that we could not have got a  European friend for the purpose, but Polak would not brook the  suggestion. So we three went to the Registrar of marriages. How  could he be sure that the parties to a marriage in which I acted as  the best man would be whites? He proposed to postpone registration  pending inquiries. The next day was a Sunday. The day following was  New Year's Day, a public holiday. To postpone the date of a solemnly  arranged wedding on such a flimsy pretext was more than one could  put up with. I knew the Chief Magistrate, who was head of the  Registration Department. So I appeared before him with the couple.  He laughed and gave me a note to the Registrar and the marriage was  duly registered.  Up to now the Europeans living with us had been more or less known  to me before. But now an English lady who was an utter stranger to  us entered the family. I do not remember our ever having had a  difference with the newly married couple, but even if Mrs. Polak and  my wife had some unpleasant experiences, they would have been no more  than what happens in the best-regulated homogeneous families. And let  it be remembered that mine would be considered an essentially  heterogeneous family, where people of all kinds and temperaments  were freely admitted. When we come to think of it, the distinction  between heterogeneous and homogeneous is discovered to be merely  imaginary. We are all one family.  I had better celebrate West's wedding also in this chapter. At this  stage of my life, my ideas about brahmacharya had not fully  matured, and so I was interesting myself in getting all my bachelor  friends married. When, in due course, West made a pilgrimage to Louth  to see his parents, I advised him to return married if  possible. Phoenix was the common home, and as we were all supposed  to have become farmers, we were not afraid of marriage and its usual  consequences. West returned with Mrs. West, a beautiful young lady  from Leicester. She came of a family of shoemakers working in a  Leicester factory. I have called her beautiful, because it was her  moral beauty that at once attracted me. True beauty after all  consists in purity of heart. With Mr. West had come his  mother-in-law too. The old lady is still alive. She put us all to  shame by her industry and her buoyant, cheerful nature. In the same way as I persuaded these European friends to marry, I  encouraged the Indian friends to send for their families from home.  Phoenix thus developed into a little village, half a dozen families  having come and settled and begun to increase there.  It has already been seen that, though household expenses were heavy,  the tendency towards simplicity began in Durban. But the  Johannesburg house came in for much severer overhauling in the light  of Ruskin's teaching.  I introduced as much simplicity as was possible in a barrister's  house. It was impossible to do without a certain amount of  furniture. The change was more internal than external. The liking  for doing personally all the physical labour increased. I therefore  began to bring my children also under that discipline.  Instead of buying baker's bread, we began to prepare unleavened  wholemeal bread at home according to Kuhne's recipe. Common mill  flour was no good for this, and the use of hand-ground flour, it was  thought, would ensure more simplicity, health and economy. So I  purchased a hand-mill for \u00a3. The iron wheel was too heavy to be  tacked by one man, but easy for two. Polak and I and the children  usually worked it. My wife also occasionally lent a hand, though the  grinding hour was her usual time for commencing kitchen work. Mrs.  Polak now joined us on her arrival. The grinding proved a very  beneficial exercise for the children. Neither this nor any other  work was ever imposed on them, but it was a pastime to them to come  and lend a hand, and they were at liberty to break off whenever  tired. But the children, including those whom I shall have occasion  to introduce later, as a rule never failed me. Not that I had no  laggards at all, but most did their work cheerfully enough. I can  recall few youngsters in those days fighting shy of work or pleading  fatigue.  We had engaged a servant to look after the house. He lived with us  as a member of the family, and the children used to help him in his  work. The municipal sweeper removed the night-soil, but we  personally attended to the cleaning of the closet instead of asking  or expecting the servant to do it. This proved a good training for  the children. The result was that none of my sons developed any  aversion for scavenger's work, and they naturally got a good  grounding in general sanitation. There was hardly any illness in the  home at Johannesburg, but whenever there was any, the nursing was  willingly done by the children. I will not say that I was  indifferent to their literary education, but I certainly did not  hesitate to sacrifice it. My sons have therefore some reason for a  grievance against me. Indeed they have occasionally given expression  to it, and I must plead guilty to a certain extent. The desire to  give them a literary education was there. I even endeavoured to give  it to them myself, but every now and then there was some hitch or  other. As I had made no other arrangement for their private tuition,  I used to get them to walk with me daily to the office and back home  \u2013 a distance of about five miles in all. This gave them and me a fair  amount of exercise. I tried to instruct them by conversation during  these walks, if there was no one else claiming my attention. All my  children, excepting the eldest, Harilal, who had stayed away in  India, were brought up in Johannesburg in this manner. Had I been  able to devote at least an hour to their literary education with  strict regularity, I should have given them, in my opinion, an ideal  education. But it was been their, as also my, regret that I failed  to ensure them enough literary training. The eldest son has often  given vent to his distress privately before me and publicly in the  press; the other sons have generously forgiven the failure as  unavoidable. I am not heart-broken over it and the regret, if any,  is that I did not prove an ideal father. But I hold that I  sacrificed their literary training to what I genuinely, though may  be wrongly, believed to be service to the community. I am quite  clear that I have not been negligent in doing whatever was needful  for building up their character. I believe it is the bounden duty of  every parent to provide for this properly. Whenever, in spite of my  endeavour, my sons have been found wanting, it is my certain  conviction that they have reflected, not want of care on my part,  but the defects of both their parents.  Children inherit the qualities of the parents, no less than their  physical features. Environment does play an important part, but the  original capital on which a child starts in life is inherited from  its ancestors. I have also seen children successfully surmounting  the effects of an evil inheritance. That is due to purity being an  inherent attribute of the soul.  Polak and I had often very heated discussions about the desirability  or otherwise of giving the children an English education. It has  always been my conviction that Indian parents who train their  children to think and talk in English from their infancy betray  their children and their country. They deprive them of the spiritual  and social heritage of the nation, and render them to that extent  unfit for the service of the country. Having these convictions, I  made a point of always talking to my children in Gujarati. Polak  never liked this. He thought I was spoiling their future. He  contended, with all the vigour and love at his command, that, if  children were to learn a universal language like English from their  infancy, they would easily gain considerable advantage over others  in the race of life. He failed to convince me. I do not now remember  whether I convinced him of the correctness of my attitude, or  whether he gave me up as too obstinate. This happened about twenty  years ago, and my convictions have only deepened with experience.  Though my sons have suffered for want of full literary education,  the knowledge of the mother tongue that they naturally acquired has  been all to their and the country's good, inasmuch as they do not  appear the foreigners they would otherwise have appeared. They  naturally become bilingual, speaking and writing English with fair  ease, because of daily contact with a large circle of English  friends, and because of their stay in a country where English was  the chief language spoken. ",
    "1898-1902": " So I sailed for home. Mauritius was one of the ports of call, and as  the boat made a long halt there, I went ashore and acquainted myself  fairly well with the local conditions. For one night I was the guest  of Sir Charles Bruce, the Governor of the Colony.  After reaching India I spent some time in going about the country.  It was the year  when the Congress met at Calcutta under the  presidentship of Mr. (later Sir) Dinshaw Wacha. And I of course  attended it. It was my first experience of the Congress.  From Bombay I traveled in the same train as Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, as I had to  speak to him about conditions in South Africa. I knew the kingly  style in which he lived. He had engaged a special saloon for  himself, and I had orders to take my opportunity of speaking to him  by traveling in his saloon for one stage. I, therefore, went to the  saloon and reported myself at the appointed station. With him were  Mr. Wacha, and Mr. (now Sir) Chimanlal Setalvad. They were  discussing politics. As soon as Sir Pherozeshah saw me, he said,  'Gandhi, it seems nothing can be done for you. Of course we will  pass the resolution you want. But what rights have we in our own  country? I believe that, so long as we have no power in our own  land, you cannot fare better in the colonies.'  I was taken aback.  Mr. Setalvad seemed to concur in the view; Mr. Wacha cast a pathetic  look at me.  I tried to plead with Sir Pherozeshah, but it was out of  the question for one like me to prevail upon the uncrowned king of  Bombay. I contented myself with the fact that I should be allowed to  move my resolution.  'You will of course show me the resolution,' said  Mr. Wacha, to cheer me up. I thanked him and left them at the next  stop.  So we reached Calcutta. The President was taken to his camp  with great \u00e9clat by the Reception Committee. I asked a volunteer where I was to go.  He took me to the Ripon College, where a number of delegates were  being put up. Fortune favoured me. Lokamanya was put up in the same  block as I. I have a recollection that he came a day later.  And as was natural, Lokamanya would never be without his darbar. Were I a  painter, I could paint him as I saw him seated on his bed \u2013 so  vivid is the whole scene in my memory. Of the numberless people that  called on him, I can recollect today only one, namely, the late Babu  Motilal Ghose, editor of the Amrita Bazar Patrika.  Their loud laughter and their talks about the wrong-doings of the  ruling race cannot be forgotten. But I propose to examine in some  detail the appointments in this camp. The volunteers were clashing  against one another. You asked one of them to do something. He  delegated it to another, and he in his turn to a third, and so on;  and as for the delegates, they were neither here nor there.  I made  friends with a few volunteers. I told them some things about South  Africa, and they felt somewhat ashamed. I tried to bring home to  them the secret of service. They seemed to understand, but service  is no mushroom growth. It presupposes the will first, and then  experience. There was no lack of will on the part of those good  simple-hearted young men, but their experience was nil. The Congress  would meet three days every year and then go to sleep. What training  could one have out of a three days' show once a year? And the  delegates were of a piece with the volunteers. They had no better or  longer training. They would do nothing themselves. 'Volunteer, do  this', 'Volunteer, do that', were their constant orders. Even here I was face to face with untouchability in a fair measure.  The Tamilian kitchen was far away from the rest. To the Tamil delegates  even the sight of others, whilst they were dining, meant pollution.  So a special kitchen had to be made for them in the college  compound, walled in by wicker-work. It was full of smoke which  choked you. It was a kitchen, dining room, washroom, all in one  \u2013 a close safe with no outlet. To me this looked like a travesty of Varnadharma. If, I said to myself, there was such untouchability between the  delegates of the Congress, one could well imagine the extent to  which it existed amongst their constituents. I heaved a sigh at the  thought.  There was no limit to insanitation. Pools of water were  everywhere. There were only a few latrines, and the recollection of  their stink still oppresses me. I pointed it out to the volunteers.  They said pointblank: 'That is not our work, it is the scavenger's  work.' I asked for a broom. The man stared at me in wonder. I  procured one and cleaned the latrine. But that was for myself. The  rush was so great, and the latrines were so few, that they needed  frequent cleaning; but that was more than I could do. So I had to  content myself with simply ministering to myself. And the others did  not seem to mind the stench and the dirt.  But that was not all. Some  of the delegates did not scruple to use the verandahs outside their  rooms for calls of nature at night. In the morning I pointed out the  spots to the volunteers. No one was ready to undertake the cleaning,  and I found no one to share the honour with me of doing it.  Conditions have since considerably improved, but even today  thoughtless delegates are not wanting who disfigure the Congress  camp by committing nuisances wherever they choose, and all the  volunteers are not always ready to clean up after them.  I saw that, if the Congress session were to be prolonged, conditions would be  quite favourable for the outbreak of an epidemic.  In the Congress at last. The immense pavilion and the volunteers in  stately array, as also the elders seated on the dais, overwhelmed me. I wondered where I should be in that vast assemblage. The presidential address was a book by itself. To read it from cover  to cover was out of the question. Only a few passages were therefore  read. After this came the election of the Subjects Committee. Gokhale took  me to the Committee meetings. Sir Pherozeshah had of course agreed to admit my resolution, but I  was wondering who would put it before the Subjects Committee, and  when. For there were lengthy speeches to every resolution, all in  English to boot, and every resolution had some well-known leader to  back it. Mine was but a feeble pipe amongst those veteran drums, and  as the night was closing in, my heart beat fast. The resolutions  coming at the fag-end were, so far as I can recollect, rushed  through at lighting speed. Everyone was hurrying to go. It was  eleven o'clock. I had not the courage to speak. I had already met Gokhale,  who had looked at my resolution. So I drew near his chair and  whispered to him: 'Please do something for me.' He said: 'Your  resolution is not out of my mind. You see the way they are rushing  through the resolutions. But I will not allow yours to be passed  over.' 'So we have done?' said Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. 'No, no there is still the resolution on South Africa. Mr. Gandhi  has been waiting long,' cried out Gokhale. 'Have you seen the resolution?' asked Sir Pherozeshah.  'Of course.' 'Do you like it?' 'It is quite good.' 'Well then, let us have it, Gandhi.' I read it trembling. Gokhale supported it. 'Unanimously passed,' cried out everyone. 'You will have five minutes to speak on it, Gandhi,' said Mr. Wacha. The procedure was far from pleasing to me. No one had troubled to  understand the resolution, everyone was in a hurry to go and,  because Gokhale had seen the resolution, it was not thought  necessary for the rest to see it or understand it! The morning found me worrying about my speech. What was I to say in  five minutes? I had prepared myself fairly well, but the words would  not come to me. I had decided not to read my speech but to speak ex tempore.  But the faculty for speaking that I had acquired in South Africa  seemed to have left me for the moment. As soon as it was time for my resolution, Mr. Wacha called out my  name. I stood up. My head was reeling. I read the resolution  somehow. Someone had printed and distributed amongst the delegates  copies of a poem he had written in praise of foreign emigration. I  read the poem and referred to the grievances of the settlers in  South Africa. Just at this moment Mr. Wacha rang the bell. I was  sure I had not yet spoken for five minutes. I did not know that the  bell was rung in order to warn me to finish in two minutes more. I  had heard others speak for half an hour or three quarters of an  hour, and yet no bell was rung for them. I felt hurt and sat down as  soon as the bell was rung. But my childlike intellect thought then  that the poem contained an answer to Sir Pherozeshah. There was no  question about the passing of the resolution. In those days there  was hardly any difference between visitors and delegates. Everyone  raised his hand and all resolutions passed unanimously. My  resolution also fared in this wise and so lost all its importance  for me. And yet the very fact that it was passed by the Congress was  enough to delight my heart. The knowledge that the imprimatur  of the Congress meant that of the whole country was enough to  delight anyone. There were yet two days for the Congress session to begin. I had made up  my mind to offer my services to the Congress office in order to gain  some experience. So as soon as I had finished the daily ablutions on  arrival at Calcutta, I proceeded to the Congress office.  Babu Bhupendranath Basu and Sjt. Ghosal were the secretaries. I went  to Bhupenbabu and offered my services. He looked at me, and said: 'I  have no work, but possibly Ghosalbabu might have something to give  you. Please go to him.'  So I went to him. He scanned me and said with a smile: 'I can give  you only clerical work. Will you do it?'  'Certainly', said I. 'I am here to do anything that is not beyond  my capacity.'  'That is the right spirit, young man', he said. Addressing the  volunteers who surrounded him, he added, 'Do you hear what this  young man says?'  Then turning to me he proceeded: 'Well then, here is a heap of  letters for disposal. Take that chair and begin. As you see,  hundreds of people come to see me. What am I to do? Am I to meet  them, or am I to answer these busybodies inundating me with letters?  I have no clerks to whom I can entrust this work. Most of these  letters have nothing in them, but you will please look them through.  Acknowledge those that are worth it, and refer to me those that need  a considered reply.'  I was delighted at the confidence reposed in me.  Sjt. Ghosal did not know me when he gave me the work. Only later did  he enquire about my credentials.  I found my work very easy \u2013 the disposal of that heap of  correspondence. I had done with it in no time, and Sjt. Ghosal was  very glad. He was talkative. He would talk away for hours together.  When he learnt something from me about my history, he felt rather  sorry to have given me clerical work. But I reassured him: 'Please  don't worry. What am I before you? You have grown gray in the  service of the Congress, and are as an elder to me. I am but an  inexperienced youth. You have put me under a debt of obligation by  entrusting me with this work. For I want to do Congress work, and  you have given me the rare opportunity of understanding the  details.'  'To tell you the truth,' said Sjt. Ghosal, 'that is the proper  spirit. But young men of today do not realize it. Of course I have  known the Congress since its birth. In fact I may claim a certain  share with Mr. Hume in bringing the Congress into being.'  And thus we became good friends. He insisted on my having lunch with  him.  Sjt. Ghosal used to get his shirt buttoned by his bearer. I  volunteered to do the bearer's duty, and I loved to do it, as my  regard for elders was always great. When he came to know this, he  did not mind my doing little acts of personal service for him. In  fact he was delighted. Asking me to button his shirt, he would say,  'You see, now, the Congress secretary has no time even to button his  shirt. He has always some work to do.' Sjt. Ghosal's naivet\u00e9 amused  me, but did not create any dislike in me for service of that nature.  The benefit I received from this service in incalculable.  In a few days I came to know the working of the Congress. I met most  of the leaders, I observed the movements of stalwarts like Gokhale  and Surendranath. I also noticed the huge waste of time there. I  observed too, with sorrow even then, the prominent place that the  English language occupied in our affairs. There was little regard  for economy of energy. More than one did the work of one, and many  an important thing was no one's business at all.  Critical as my mind was in observing these things, there was enough  charity in me, and so I always thought that it might, after all, be  impossible to do better in the circumstances, and that saved me from  undervaluing any work.  The Congress was over, but as I had to meet the Chamber of Commerce and  various people in connection with work in South Africa, I stayed in  Calcutta for a month. Rather than stay this time in a hotel, I  arranged to get the required introduction for a room in the India  Club. Among its members were some prominent Indians, and I looked  forward to getting into touch with them and interesting them in the  work in South Africa. Gokhale frequently went to this Club to play  billiards, and when he knew that I was to stay in Calcutta for some  time, he invited me to stay with him. I thankfully accepted the  invitation, but did not think it proper to go there by myself. He  waited for a day or two and then took me personally. He discovered  my reserve and said: 'Gandhi, you have to stay in the country, and  this sort of reserve will not do. You must get into touch with as  many people as possible. I want you to do Congress work.'  I shall record here an incident in the India Club, before I proceed  to talk of my stay with Gokhale.  Lord Curzon held his darbar about this time. Some Rajas and  Maharajas who had been invited to the darbar were members of the  Club. In the Club I always found them wearing fine Bengali dhotis  and shirts and scarves. On the darbar day they put on trousers  befitting khansamas and shining boots. I was pained and inquired of one of them the  reason for the change.  'We alone know our unfortunate condition. We alone know the insults  we have to put up with, in order that we may possess our wealth and  titles,' he replied.  'But what about these khansama  turbans and these shining boots?' I asked.  'Do you see any difference between khansamas  and us?' he replied, and added, 'they are our khansamas,  we are Lord Cruzon's khansamas.  If I were to absent myself from the lev\u00e9e,  I should have to suffer the consequences. If I were to attend it in  my usual dress, it would be an offence. And do you think I am going  to get any opportunity there of talking to Lord Curzon? Not a bit of  it!'  I was moved to pity for this plain-spoken friend.  This reminds me of another darbar.  At the time when Lord Hardinge laid the foundation-stone of the  Hindu University, there was a darbar. There were Rajas and Maharajas  of course, but Pandit Malaviyaji specially invited me also to attend  it, and I did so.  I was distressed to see the Maharajas bedecked like women \u2013 silk pyjamas and silk achkans,  pearl necklaces round their necks, bracelets on their wrists, pearl  and diamond tassels on their turbans and, besides all this, swords  with golden hilts hanging from their waist-bands.  I discovered that these were insignia not of their royalty, but of  their slavery. I had thought that they must be wearing these badges  of impotence of their own free will, but I was told that it was  obligatory for these Rajas to wear all their costly jewels at such  functions. I also gathered that some of them had a positive dislike  for wearing these jewels, and that they never wore them except on  occasions like the darbar.  I do not know how far my information was  correct. But whether they wear them on other occasions or not, it is  distressing enough to have to attend viceregal darbars in jewels  that only some women wear.  How heavy is the toll of sins and wrongs that wealth, power and  prestige exact from man!",
    "1903-1907": " We now reach the stage in this story when I began seriously to think of  taking the brahmacharya vow. I had been wedded to a monogamous ideal ever since my marriage,  faithfulness to my wife being part of the love of truth. But it was  in South Africa that I came to realize the importance of observing brahmacharya even with respect to my wife. I cannot definitely say what  circumstance or what book it was, that set my thoughts in that  direction, but I have a recollection that the predominant factor was  the influence of Raychandbhai, of whom I have already written, I can  still recall a conversation that I had with him. On one occasion I  spoke to him in high praise of Mrs. Gladstone's devotion to her  husband. I had read some where that Mrs. Gladstone insisted on  preparing tea for Mr. Gladstone even in the House of Commons, and  that this had become a rule in the life of this illustrious couple,  whose actions were governed by regularity. I spoke of this to the  poet, and incidentally eulogized conjugal love. 'Which of the two do  you prize more,' asked Raychandbhai, 'the love of Mrs. Gladstone for  her husband as his wife, or her devoted service irrespective of her  relation to Mr. Gladstone? Supposing she had been his sister, or his  devoted servant, and ministered to him with the same attention, what  would you have said? Do we not have instances of such devoted  sisters or servants? Supposing you had found the same loving  devotion in a male servant, would you have been pleased in the same  way as in Mrs. Gladstone's case? Just examine the view-point  suggested by me.'  Raychandbhai was himself married. I have an impression that at the  moment his words sounded harsh, but they gripped me irresistibly.  The devotion of a servant was, I felt, a thousand times more  praiseworthy than that of a wife to her husband. There was nothing  surprising in the wife's devotion to her husband, as there was an  indissoluble bond between them. The devotion was perfectly natural.  But it required a special effort to cultivate equal devotion  between master and servant. The poet's point of view began gradually  to grow upon me.  What then, I asked myself, should be my relation  with my wife? Did my faithfulness consist in making my wife the  instrument of my lust? So long as I was the slave of lust, my  faithfulness was worth nothing. To be fair to my wife, I must say  that she was never the temptress. It was therefore the easiest thing  for me to take the vow of brahmacharya, if only I willed it. It was my weak will or lustful attachment  that was the obstacle.  Even after my conscience had been roused in  the matter, I failed twice. I failed because the motive that  actuated the effort was none the highest. My main object was to  escape having more children. Whilst in England I had read something  about contraceptives. I have already referred to Dr. Allinson's  birth control propaganda in the chapter on Vegetarianism. If it had  some temporary effect on me, Mr. Hill's opposition to those methods  and his advocacy of internal efforts as opposed to outward means, in  a word, of self-control, had a far greater effect, which in due time  came to be abiding. Seeing, therefore, that I did not desire more  children I began to strive after self-control. There was endless  difficulty in the task. We began to sleep in separate beds. I  decided to retire to bed only after the day's work had left me  completely exhausted. All these efforts did not seem to bear much  fruit, but when I look back upon the past, I feel that the final  resolution was the cumulative effect of those unsuccessful  strivings.  The final resolution could only be made as late as . Satyagraha  had not then been started. I had not the least notion of its coming.  I was practising in Johannesburg at the time of the Zulu 'Rebellion'  in Natal, which came soon after the Boer War. I felt that I must  offer my services to the Natal Government on that occasion. The  offer was accepted, as we shall see in another chapter. But the work  set me furiously thinking in the direction of self-control, and  according to my wont I discussed my thoughts with my co-workers. It  became my conviction that procreation and the consequent care of  children were inconsistent with public service. I had to break up  my household at Johannesburg to be able to serve during the  'Rebellion'. Within one month of offering my services, I had to give  up the house I had so carefully furnished. I took my wife and  children to Phoenix and led the Indian ambulance corps attached to  the Natal forces. During the difficult marches that had then to be  performed, the idea flashed upon me that, if I wanted to devote  myself to the service of the community in this manner I must  relinquish the desire for children and wealth and live the life of a vanaprastha - of one retired from household cares.  The 'Rebellion' did not occupy  me for more than six weeks, but this brief period proved to be a  very important epoch in my life. The importance of vows grew upon me  more clearly than ever before. I realized that a vow, far from  closing the door to real freedom, opened it. Up to this time I had  not met with success because the will had been lacking, because I  had had no faith in myself, no faith in the grace of God, and  therefore my mind had been tossed on the boisterous sea of doubt. I  realized that in refusing to take a vow man was drawn into  temptation, and that to be bound by a vow was like a passage from  libertinism to a real monogamous marriage. 'I believe in effort, I  do not want to bind myself with vows' is the mentality of weakness  and betrays a subtle desire for the thing to be avoided. Or where  can be the difficulty in making a final decision? I vow to flee  from the serpent which I know will bite me, I do not simply make an  effort to flee from him. I know that mere effort may mean certain  death. Mere effort means ignorance of the certain fact that the  serpent is bound to kill me. The fact, therefore, that I could rest  content with an effort only means that I have not yet clearly  realized the necessity of definite action. 'But supposing my views  are changed in the future, how can I bind myself by a vow?' Such a  doubt often deters us. But that doubt also betrays a lack of clear  perception that a particular thing must be renounced. That is why Nishkulanand has sung:  'Renunciaton without aversion is not lasting.'  Where therefore the desire is gone, a vow of renunciation is the  natural and inevitable fruit.  I\thad started on a life of ease and comfort, but the experiment was  short-lived. Although I had furnished the house with care, yet it  failed to have any hold on me. So no sooner had I launched forth on  that life, than I began to cut down expenses. The washerman's bill  was heavy, and as he was besides by no means noted for his  punctuality, even two to three dozen shirts and collars proved  insufficient for me. Collars had to be changed daily and shirts, if  not daily, at least every alternate day. This meant a double  expense, which appeared to me unnecessary. So I equipped myself with  a washing outfit to save it. I bought a book on washing, studied the  art and taught it also to my wife. This no doubt added to my work,  but its novelty made it a pleasure.  I shall never forget the first collar that I washed myself. I had  used more starch than necessary, the iron had not been made hot  enough, and for fear of burning the collar I had not pressed it  sufficiently. The result was that, though the collar was fairly  stiff, the superfluous starch continually dropped off it. I went to  court with the collar on, thus inviting the ridicule of brother  barristers, but even in those days I could be impervious to  ridicule.  'Well,' said I, 'this is my first experiment at washing my own  collars and hence the loose starch. But it does not trouble me, and  then there is the advantage of providing you with so much fun.' 'But surely there is no lack of laundries here?' asked a friend. 'The laundry bill is very heavy,' said I. 'The charge for washing a  collar is almost as much as its price, and even then there is the  eternal dependence on the washerman. I prefer by far to wash my things myself.'  But I could not make my friends appreciate the beauty of self-help.  In course of time I became an expert washerman so far as my own work went, and my washing was by no means  inferior to laundry washing. My collars were no less stiff or shiny  than others.  When Gokhale came to South Africa, he had with him a scarf which was  a gift from Mahadeo Govind Ranade. He treasured the memento with the  utmost care and used it only on special occasions. One such occasion  was the banquet given in his honour by the Johannesburg Indians. The  scarf was creased and needed ironing. It was not possible to send it  to the laundry and get it back in time. I offered to try my art. 'I can trust to your capacity as a lawyer, but not as a washerman,'  said Gokhale; 'What if you should soil it? Do you know what it means  to me?'  With this he narrated, with much joy, the story of the gift. I still  insisted, guaranteed good work, got his permission to iron it, and  won his certificate. After that I did not mind if the rest of the  world refused me its certificate.  In the same way, as I freed myself from slavery to the washerman, I  threw off dependence on the barber. All people who go to England  learn there at least the art of shaving, but none, to my knowledge,  learn to cut their own hair. I had to learn that too. I once went to  an English hair-cutter in Pretoria. He contemptuously refused to cut  my hair. I certainly felt hurt, but immediately purchased a pair of  clippers and cut my hair before the mirror. I succeeded more or less  in cutting the front hair, but I spoiled the back. The friends in  the court shook with laughter.  'What's wrong with your hair, Gandhi? Rats have been at it?' 'No.  The white barber would not condescend to touch my black hair,' said  I, 'so I preferred to cut it myself, no matter how badly.'  The reply did not surprise the friends.  The barber was not at fault in having refused to cut my hair. There  was every chance of his losing his custom, if he should serve black  men. We do not allow our barbers to serve our untouchable brethren.  I got the reward of this in South Africa, not once, but many times,  and the conviction that it was the punishment for our own sins saved  me from becoming angry.  The extreme forms in which my passion for self-help and simplicity  ultimately expressed itself will be described in their proper place.  The seed had been long sown. It only needed watering to take root,  to flower and to fructify, and the watering came in due course.  After full discussion and mature deliberation I took the vow in . I  had not shared my thoughts with my wife until then, but only  consulted her at the time of taking the vow. She had no objection.  But I had great difficulty in making the final resolve. I had not  the necessary strength. How was I to control my passions? The  elimination of carnal relationship with one's wife seemed then a  strange thing. But I launched forth with faith in the sustaining  power of God.  As I look back upon the twenty years of the vow, I am  filled with pleasure and wonderment. The more or less successful  practice of self-control had been going on since . But the  freedom and joy that came to me after taking the vow had never been  experienced before . Before the vow I had been open to being  overcome by temptation at any moment. Now the vow was a sure shield  against temptation. The great potentiality of brahmacharya  daily became more an more patent to me. The vow was taken when I was  in Phoenix. As soon as I was free from ambulance work, I went to  Phoenix, whence I had to return to Johannesburg. In about a month of  my returning there, the foundation of Satyagraha was laid. As though  unknown to me, the brahmacharya vow had been preparing me for it. Satyagraha had not been a  preconceived plan. It came on spontaneously, without my having  willed it. But I could see that all my previous steps had led up to  that goal. I had cut down my heavy household expenses at  Johannesburg and gone to Phoenix to take, as it were, the  brahmacharya vow.  The knowledge that a perfect observance of brahmacharya  means realization of brahman,  I did not owe to a study of the Shastras. It slowly grew upon me  with experience. The shastric texts on the subject I read only later  in life. Every day of the vow has taken me nearer the knowledge that  in brahmacharya lies the protection of the body, the mind and the soul. For brahmacharya  was now no process of hard penance, it was a matter of consolation  and joy. Every day revealed a fresh beauty in it.  But if it was a matter of ever-increasing joy, let no one believe that it was an  easy thing for me. Even when I am past fifty-six years, I realize  how hard a thing it is. Every day I realize more and more that it is  like walking on the sword's edge, and I see every moment the  necessity for eternal vigilance.  Control of the palate is the first essential in the observance of  the vow. I found that complete control of the palate made the  observance very easy, and so I now pursued my dietetic experiments  not merely from the vegetarian's but also from the brahmachari's  point of view. As the result of these experiments I saw that the brahmachari's  food should be limited, simple, spiceless, and, if possible, uncooked.  Six years of experiment have showed me that the brahmachari's  ideal food is fresh fruit and nuts. The immunity from passion that I  enjoyed when I lived on this food was unknown to me after I changed  that diet. Brahmacharya needed no effort on my part in South Africa when I lived on fruits  and nuts alone. It has been a matter of very great effort ever since  I began to take milk. How I had to go back to milk from a fruit diet  will be considered in its proper place. It is enough to observe here  that I have not the least doubt that milk diet makes the  brahmacharya vow difficult to observe. Let no one deduce from this that all brahmacharis must give up milk. The effect on  brahmacharya of different kinds of food can be determined only after numerous  experiments. I have yet to find a fruit-substitute for milk which is  an equally good muscle-builder and easily digestible. The doctors,  vaidyas and hakims have alike failed to enlighten me. Therefore, though I know milk to  be partly a stimulant, I cannot, for the time being, advise anyone  to give it up.  As an external aid to brahmacharya,  fasting is as necessary as selection and restriction in diet. So  overpowering are the senses that they can be kept under control only  when they are completely hedged in on all sides, from above and from  beneath. It is common knowledge that they are powerless without  food, and so fasting undertaken with a view to control of the senses  is, I have no doubt, very helpful. With some, fasting is of no  avail, because assuming that mechanical fasting alone will make them  immune, they keep their bodies without food, but feast their minds  upon all sorts of delicacies, thinking all the while what they will  eat and what they will drink after the fast terminates. Such fasting  helps them in controlling neither palate nor lust. Fasting is  useful, when mind co-operates with starving body, that is to say,  when it cultivates a distaste for the objects that are denied to the  body. Mind is at the root of all sensuality. Fasting, therefore, has  a limited use, for a fasting man may continue to be swayed by  passion. But it may be said that extinction of the sexual passion is  as a rule impossible without fasting, which may be said to be  indispensable for the observance of brahmacharya. Many  aspirants after brahmacharya fail because in the use of their  other senses they want to carry on like those who are not brahmacharis.  Their effort is, therefore, identical with the effort to experience  the bracing cold of winter in the scorching summer months. There  should be a clear line between the life of a brahmachari and  of one who is not. The resemblance that there is between the two is  only apparent. The distinction ought to be clear as daylight. Both  use their eyesight, but whereas the brahmachari uses it to see the  glories of God, the other uses it to see the frivolity around him.  Both use their ears, but whereas the one hears nothing but praises  of God, the other feasts his ears upon ribaldry. Both often keep  late hours, but whereas the one devotes them to prayer, the other  fritters them away in wild and wasteful mirth. Both feed the inner  man, but the one only to keep the temple of God in good repair,  while the other gorges himself and makes the sacred vessel a  stinking gutter. Thus both live as the poles apart, and the distance  between them will grow and not diminish with the passage of time. Brahmacharya means control of the senses in thought, word and  deed. Every day I have been realizing more and more the necessity  for restraints of the kind I have detailed above. There is no limit  to the possibilities of renunciation, even as there is none to those  of brahmacharya. Such brahmacharya is impossible of attainment by  limited effort. For many it must remain only as an ideal. An  aspirant after brahmacharya will always be conscious of his  shortcomings, will seek out the passions lingering in the innermost  recesses of his heart and will incessantly strive to get rid of  them. So long as thought is not under complete control of the will, brahmacharya in its fullness is absent. Involuntary thought is an  affection of the mind, and curbing of thought, therefore, means  curbing of the mind which is even more difficult to curb than the  wind. Nevertheless the existence of God within makes even control of  the mind possible. Let no one think that it is impossible because it  is difficult. It is the highest goal, and it is no wonder that the  highest effort should be necessary to attain it.  But it was after coming to India that I realized that such brahmacharya  was impossible to attain by mere human effort. Until then I had been labouring  under the delusion that fruit diet alone would enable me  to eradicate all passions, and I had flattered myself with the  belief that I had nothing more to do.  But I must not anticipate the chapter of my struggles. Meanwhile let me make it clear that those  who desire to observe brahmacharya with a view to realizing God need not despair, provided their faith  in God is equal to their confidence in their own effort. 'The  sense-objects turn away from an abstemious soul, leaving the relish  behind. The relish also disappears with the realization of the  Highest.' Therefore His name and His grace are the last resources of  the aspirant after moksha.  This truth came to me only after my return to India. The Zulu 'rebellion' was full of new experiences and gave me much food  for thought. The Boer War had not brought home to me the horrors of  war with anything like the vividness that the 'rebellion' did. This  was no war but a man-hunt, not only in my opinion, but also in that  of many Englishmen with whom I had occasion to talk. To hear every  morning reports of the soldiers' rifles exploding like crackers in  innocent hamlets, and to live in the midst of them was a trial. But  I swallowed the bitter draught, especially as the work of my Corps  consisted only in nursing the wounded Zulus. I could see that but  for us the Zulus would have been uncared for. This work, therefore,  eased my conscience.  But there was much else to set one thinking. It  was a sparsely populated part of the country. Few and far between in  hills and dales were the scattered Kraals of the simple and  so-called 'uncivilized' Zulus. Marching, with or without the  wounded, through these solemn solitudes, I often fell into deep  thought.  I pondered over brahmacharya and its implications, and my convictions took deep root. I discussed  it with my co-workers. I had not realized then how indispensable it  was for self-realization, but I clearly saw that one aspiring to  serve humanity with his whole soul could not do without it. It was  borne in upon me that I should have more and more occasions for  service of the kind I was rendering, and that I should find myself  unequal to my task if I were engaged in the pleasures of family life  and in the propagation and rearing of children.  In a word, I could not live both after the flesh and the spirit. On  the present occasion, for instance, I should not have been able to  throw myself into the fray, had my wife been expecting a baby.  Without the observance of brahmacharya service of the family would be inconsistent with service of the  community. With brahmacharya they would be perfectly consistent.  So thinking, I became somewhat impatient to take a final vow. The  prospect of the vow brought a certain kind of exultation.  Imagination also found free play and opened out limitless vistas of  service.  Whilst I was thus in the midst of strenuous physical and mental  work, a report came to the effect that the work of suppressing the  'rebellion' was nearly over, and that we should soon be discharged.  A day or two after this our discharge came and in a few days we got  back to our homes.  After a short while I got a letter from the Governor specially  thanking the Ambulance Corps for its services.  On my arrival at Phoenix I eagerly broached the subject of brahmacharya  with Chhaganlal, Maganlal, West and others. They liked the idea and  accepted the necessity of taking the vow, but they also represented  the difficulties of the task. Some of them set themselves bravely to  observe it, and some, I know, succeeded also.  I too took the plunge \u2013 the vow to observe brahmacharya  for life. I must confess that I had not then fully realized the  magnitude and immensity of the task I undertook. The difficulties  are even today staring me in the face. The importance of the vow is  being more and more borne in upon me. Life without brahmacharya  appears to me to be insipid and animal-like. The brute by nature  knows no self-restraint. Man is man because he is capable of, and  only in so far as he exercises, self-restraint. What formerly  appeared to me to be extravagant praise of brahmacharya  in our religious books seems now, with increasing clearness every  day, to be absolutely proper and founded on experience. I saw that brahmacharya, which is so full of wonderful potency, is by no means an easy  affair, and certainly not a mere matter of the body. It begins with  bodily restraint, but does not end there. The perfection of it  precludes even an impure thought. A true brahmachari  will not even dream of satisfying the fleshly appetite, and until he  is in that condition, he has a great deal of ground to cover. For me the observance of even bodily brahmacharya  has been full of difficulties. Today I may say that I feel myself  fairly safe, but I had yet to achieve complete mastery over thought,  which is so essential. Not that the will or effort is lacking, but  it is yet a problem to me wherefrom undesirable thoughts spring  their insidious invasions. I have no doubt that there is a key to  lock out undesirable thoughts, but every one has to find it out for  himself. Saints and seers have left their experiences for us, but  they have given us no infallible and universal prescription. For  perfection or freedom from error comes only from grace, and so  seekers after God have left us mantras, such as Ramanama,  hallowed by their own austerities and charged with their purity.  Without an unreserved surrender to His grace, complete mastery over  thought is impossible. This is the teaching of every great book of  religion, and I am realizing the truth of it every moment of my  striving after that perfect brahmacharya. But part of the history of that striving and struggle will be told  in chapters to follow. I shall conclude this chapter with an  indication of how I set about the task. In the first flush of  enthusiasm, I found the observance quite easy. The very first change  I made in my mode of life was to stop sharing the same bed with my  wife or seeking privacy with her.  Thus brahmacharya which I had been observing willy-nilly since , was sealed with a  vow in the middle of .  Events were so shaping themselves in Johannesburg as to make this self-purfication  on my part a preliminary as it were to Satyagraha. I can now see  that all the principal events of my life, culminating in the vow of brahmacharya,  were secretly preparing me for it. The principle called Satyagraha  came into being before that name was invented. Indeed when it was  born, I myself could not say what it was. In Gujarati also we used  the English phrase 'passive resistance' to describe it. When in a  meeting of Europeans I found that the term 'passive resistance' was  too narrowly construed, that it was supposed to be a weapon of the  weak, that it could be characterized by hatred, and that it could  finally manifest itself as violence, I had to demur to all these  statements and explain the real nature of the Indian movement. It  was clear that a new word must be coined by the Indians to designate  their struggle.  But I could not for the life of me find out a new  name, and therefore offered a nominal prize through Indian Opinion  to the reader who made the best suggestion on the subject. As a  result Maganlal Gandhi coined the word Sadagraha (Sat: truth, Agraha:  firmness) and won the prize. But in order to make it clearer  I changed the word to Satyagraha which has since become current in  Gujarati as a designation for the struggle.  The history of this struggle is for all practical purposes a history  of the remainder of my life in South Africa and especially of my  experiments with truth in that sub-continent. I wrote the major  portion of this history in Yeravda jail and finished it after I was  released. It was published in Navajivan and subsequently issued in book form. Sjt. Valji Govindji Desai has  been translating it into English for Current Thought,  but I am now arranging to have the English translation published in  book form at an early date, so that those who will may be able to  familiarize themselves with my most important experiments in South  Africa. I would recommend a perusal of my history of Satyagraha in  South Africa to such readers as have not seen it already. I will not  repeat what I have put down there, but in the next few chapters will  deal only with a few personal incidents of my life in South Africa  which have not been covered by that history. And when I have done  with these, I will at once proceed to give the reader some idea of  my experiments in India. Therefore, anyone who wishes to consider  these experiments in their strict chronological order will now do  well to keep the history of Satyagraha in South Africa before him. I was anxious to observe brahmacharya  in thought, word and deed, and equally anxious to devote the maximum  of time to the Satyagraha struggle and fit myself for it by  cultivating purity. I was therefore led to make further changes and  to impose greater restraints upon myself in the matter of food. The  motive for the previous changes had been largely hygienic, but the  new experiments were made from a religious standpoint. Fasting and restriction in diet now played a more important part in  my life. Passion in man is generally co-existent with a hankering  after the pleasures of the palate. And so it was with me. I have  encountered many difficulties in trying to control passion as well  as taste, and I cannot claim even now to have brought them under  complete subjection. I have considered myself to be a heavy eater.  What friends have thought to be my restraint has never appeared to  me in that light. If I had failed to develop restraint to the extent  that I have, I should have descended lower than the beasts and met  my doom long ago. However, as I had adequately realized my  shortcomings, I made great efforts to get rid of them, and thanks to  this endeavour I have all these years pulled on with my body and put  in with it my share of work.  Being conscious of my weakness and unexpectedly coming in contact  with congenial company, I began to take an exclusive fruit diet or  to fast on the Ekadashi day, and also to observe  Janmashtami and similar holidays.  I began with a fruit diet, but from the standpoint of restraint I  did not find much to choose between a fruit diet and a diet of food  grains. I observed that the same indulgence of taste was possible  with the former as with the latter, and even more, when one got  accustomed to it. I therefore came to attach greater importance to  fasting or having only one meal a day on holidays. And if there was  some occasion for penance or the like, I gladly utilized it too for  the purpose of fasting.  But I also saw that, the body now being drained more effectively,  the food yielded greater relish and the appetite grew keener. It  dawned upon me that fasting could be made as powerful a weapon of  indulgence as of restraint. Many similar later experiences of mine  as well as of others can be adduced as evidence of this startling  fact. I wanted to improve and train my body, but as my chief object  now was to achieve restraint and a conquest of the palate, I  selected first one food and then another, and at the same time  restricted the amount. But the relish was after me, as it were. As I  gave up one thing and took up another, this latter afforded me a  fresher and greater relish than its predecessor. In making these experiments I had several companions, the chief of  whom was Hermann Kallenbach. I have already written about this  friend in the history of Satyagraha in South Africa, and will not go  over the same ground here. Mr. Kallenbach was always with me whether  in fasting or in dietetic changes. I lived with him at his own place  when the Satyagraha struggle was at its height. We discussed our  changes in food and derived more pleasure from the new diet than  from the old. Talk of this nature sounded quite pleasant in those  days, and did not strike me as at all improper. Experience has  taught me, however, that it was wrong to have dwelt upon the relish  of food. One should eat not in order to please the palate, but just  to keep the body going. When each organ of sense subserves the body  and through the body the soul, its special relish disappears, and  then alone does it begin to function in the way nature intended it  to do.  Any number of experiments is too small and no sacrifice is  too great for attaining this symphony with nature. But unfortunately  the current is nowadays flowing strongly in the opposite  direction. We are not ashamed to sacrifice a multitude of other  lives in decorating the perishable body and trying to prolong it  existence for a few fleeting moments, with the result that we kill  ourselves, both body and soul. In trying to cure one old disease, we  give rise to a hundred new ones; in trying to enjoy the pleasures of  sense, we lose in the end even our capacity for enjoyment. All this  is passing before our very eyes, but there are none so blind as  those who will not see.  Having thus set forth their object and the train of ideas which led  up to them, I now propose to describe the dietetic experiments at  some length.  To turn now to the Asiatic Department.  Johannesburg was the stronghold of the Asiatic officers. I had been  observing that, far from protecting the Indians, Chinese and others,  these officers were grinding them down. Every day I had complaints  like this: 'The rightful ones are not admitted, whilst those who  have no right are smuggled in on payment of \u00a3 . If you will not  remedy this state of things, who will?' I shared the feeling. If I  did not succeed in stamping out this evil, I should be living in the  Transvaal in vain.  So I began to collect evidence, and as soon as I had gathered a fair  Amount, I approached the Police Commissioner. He appeared to be a  just man. Far from giving me the cold shoulder, he listened to me  patiently and asked me to show him all the evidence in my  possession. He examined the witnesses himself and was satisfied, but  he knew as well as I that it was difficult in South Africa to get a  white jury to convict a white offender against coloured men. 'But,'  said he, 'let us try at any rate. It is not proper, either, to let  such criminals go scot-free for fear of the jury acquitting them. I  must get them arrested. I assure you I shall leave no stone  unturned.'  I did not need the assurance. I suspected quite a number of  officers, but as I had no unchallengeable evidence against them all,  warrants of arrest were issued against the two about whose guilt I  had not the slightest doubt.  My movements could never be kept secret. Many knew that I was going  to the Police Commissioner practically daily. The two officers  against whom warrants had been issued had spies more or less  efficient. They used to patrol my office and report my movements to  the officers. I must admit, however, that these officers were so bad  that they could not have had many spies. Had the Indians and the  Chinese not helped me, they would never have been arrested.  One of these absconded. The Police Commissioner obtained an  extradition warrant against him and got him arrested and brought to  the Transvaal. They were tried, and although there was strong  evidence against them, and in spite of the fact that the jury had  evidence of one of them having absconded, both were declared to be  not guilty and acquitted.  I was sorely disappointed. The Police Commissioner also was very  sorry. I was disgusted with the legal profession. The very intellect  became an abomination to me inasmuch as it could be prostituted for  screening crime.  However, the guilt of both these officers was so patent that in  spite of their acquittal the Government could not harbour them. Both  were cashiered, and the Asiatic department became comparatively  clean, and the Indian community was somewhat reassured.  The event enhanced my prestige and brought me more business. The  bulk, though not all, of the hundreds of pounds that the community  was monthly squandering in peculation, was saved. All could not be  saved, for the dishonest still plied their trade. But it was now  possible for the honest man to preserve his honesty.  I must say that, though these officers were so bad, I had nothing  against them personally. They were aware of this themselves, and  when in their straits they approached me, I helped them too. They  had a chance of getting employed by the Johannesburg Municipality in  case I did not oppose the proposal. A friend of theirs saw me in  this connection and I agreed not to thwart them, and they succeeded. This attitude of mine put the officials with whom I came in contact  perfectly at ease, and though I had often to fight with their  department and use strong language, they remained quite friendly  with me. I was not then quite conscious that such behaviour was part  of my nature. I learnt later that it was an essential part of  Satyagraha, and an attribute of ahimsa. Man and his deed are two distinct things. Whereas a good deed should  call forth approbation and a wicked deed disapprobation, the doer of  the deed, whether good or wicked always deserves respect or pity as  the case may be. 'Hate the sin and not the sinner' is a precept  which, though easy enough to understand, is rarely practised, and  that is why the poison of hatred spreads in the world. This ahimsa is the basis of the search for truth. I am realizing every day that  the search is in vain unless it is founded on ahimsa  as the basis. It is quite proper to resist and attack a system, but  to resist and attack its author is tantamount to resisting and  attacking oneself. For we are all tarred with the same brush, and  are children of one and the same Creator, and as such the divine  powers within us are infinite. To slight a single human being is to  slight those divine powers, and thus to harm not only that being but  with him the whole world. I am afraid I must continue the digression until the next chapter.  Along with my experiments in earth treatment, those in dietetics  were also being carried on, and it may not be out of place here to  make a few observations as regards the latter, though I shall have  occasion to refer to them again later.  I may not, now or hereafter, enter into a detailed account of the  experiments in dietetics, for I did so in a series of Gujarati  articles which appeared years ago in Indian Opinion,  and which were afterwards published in the form of a book popularly  known in English as A Guide to Health.  Among my little books this has been the most widely read alike in  the East and in the West, a thing that I have not yet been able to  understand. It was written for the benefit of the readers of Indian Opinion. But I know that the booklet has profoundly influenced the lives of  many, both in the East and in the West, who have never seen Indian Opinion.  For they have been corresponding with me on the subject. It has  therefore appeared necessary to say something here about the  booklet, for though I see no reason to alter the views set forth in  it, yet I have made certain radical changes in my actual practice,  of which all readers of the book do not know, and of which, I think,  they should be informed.  The booklet was written, like all my other writings, with a  spiritual end, which has always inspired every one of my actions,  and therefore it is a matter for deep distress to me that I am  unable today to practise some of the theories propounded in the  book.  It is my firm conviction that man need take no milk at all, beyond  the mother's milk that he takes as a baby. His diet should consist  of nothing but sunbaked fruits and nuts. He can secure enough  nourishment both for the tissues and the nerves from fruits like  grapes and nuts like almonds. Restraint of the sexual and other  passions becomes easy for a man who lives on such food. My  co-workers and I have seen by experience that there is much truth in  the Indian proverb that as a man eats, so shall he become. These  views have been set out elaborately in the book.  But unfortunately in India I have found myself obliged to deny some  of my theories in practice. Whilst I was engaged on the recruiting  campaign in Kheda, an error in diet laid me low, and I was at  death's door. I tried in vain to rebuild a shattered constitution  without milk. I sought the help of the doctors, vaidyas  and scientists whom I knew, to recommend a substitute for milk. Some  suggested mung water, some mowhra  oil, some almond-milk. I wore out my body in experimenting on these,  but nothing could help me to leave the sick-bed. The  vaidyas read verses to me from Charaka to show that religious scruples about  diet have no place in therapeutics. So they could not be expected to  help me to live without milk. And how could those who  recommended beef-tea and brandy without hesitation help me to  persevere with a milkless diet?  I might not take cow's or buffalo's milk, as I was bound by a vow.  The vow of course meant the giving up of all milks, but as I had  mother cow's and mother buffalo's only in mind when I took the vow,  and as I wanted to live, I somehow beguiled myself into emphasizing  the letter of the vow and decided to take goat's milk. I was fully  conscious, when I started taking mother goat's milk, that the spirit  of my vow was destroyed.  But the idea of leading a campaign against the Rowlatt Act had  possessed me. And with it grew the desire to live. Consequently one  of the greatest experiments in my life came to a stop.  I know it is argued that the soul has nothing to do with what one  eats or drinks, as the soul neither eats nor drinks; that it is not  what you put inside from without, but what you express outwardly  from within, that matters. There is no doubt some force in this. But  rather than examine this reasoning, I shall content myself with  merely declaring my firm conviction that, for the seeker who would  live in fear of God and who would see Him face to face, restraint in  diet both as to quantity and quality is as essential as restraint in  thought and speech.  In a matter, however, where my theory has failed me, I should not  only give the information, but issue a grave warning against  adopting it. I would therefore urge those who, on the strength of  the theory propounded by me, may have given up milk, not to persist  in the experiment, unless they find it beneficial in every way, or  unless they are advised by experienced physicians. Up to now my  experience here has shown me that for those with a weak digestion  and for those who are confined to bed there is no light and  nourishing diet equal to that of milk.  I should be greatly obliged if anyone with experience in this line,  who happens to read this chapter, would tell me, if he has known  from experience, and not from reading, of a vegetable substitute for  milk, which is equally nourishing and digestible.  This chapter has brought me to a stage where it becomes necessary for me  to explain to the reader how this story is written from week to  week.  When I began writing it, I had no definite plan before me. I have no  diary or documents on which to base the story of my experiments. I  write just as the Spirit moves me at the time of writing. I do not  claim to know definitely that all conscious thought and action on my  part is directed by the Spirit. But on an examination of the  greatest steps that I have taken in my life, as also of those that  may be regarded as the least, I think it will not be improper to say  that all of them were directed by the Spirit.  I have not seen Him, neither have I known Him. I have made the  world's faith in God my own, and as my faith is ineffaceable, I  regard that faith as amounting to experience. However, as it may be  said that to describe faith as experience is to tamper with truth,  it may perhaps be more correct to say that I have no word for  characterizing my belief in God.  It is perhaps now somewhat easy to understand why I believe that I am writing this story as the Spirit  prompts me. When I began the last chapter I gave it the heading I  have given to this, but as I was writing it, I realized that before  I narrated my experiences with Europeans, I must write something by  way of a preface. This I did and altered the heading. Now again, as I start on this chapter, I find myself confronted with  a fresh problem. What things to mention and what to omit regarding  the English friends of whom I am about to write is a serious  problem. If things that are relevant are omitted, truth will be  dimmed. And it is difficult to decide straightway what is relevant,  when I am not even sure about the relevancy of writing this story. I understand more clearly today what I read long ago about the  inadequacy of all autobiography as history. I know that I do not set  down in this story all that I remember. Who can say how much I must  give and how much omit in the interests of truth? And what would be  the value in a court of law of the inadequate ex parte  evidence being tendered by me of certain events in my life? If some busybody were to cross-examine me on the chapters already written,  he could probably shed much more light on them, and if it were a  hostile critic's cross-examination, he might even flatter himself  for having shown up 'the hollowness of many of my pretensions.' I, therefore, wonder for a moment whether it might not be proper to  stop writing these chapters. But so long as there is no prohibition  from the voice within, I must continue the writing. I must follow  the sage maxim that nothing once begun should be abandoned unless it  is proved to be morally wrong.  I am not writing the autobiography to please critics. Writing it is  itself one of the experiments with truth. One of its objects is  certainly to provide some comfort and food for reflection for my co-  workers. Indeed I started writing it in compliance with their  wishes. It might not have been written, if Jeramdas and Swami Anand  had not persisted in their suggestion. If, therefore, I am wrong in  writing the autobiography, they must share the blame.  But to take up the subject indicated in the heading. Just as I had  Indians living with me as members of my family, so had I English  friends living with me in Durban. Not that all who lived with me  liked it. But I persisted in having them. Nor was I wise in every  case. I had some bitter experiences, but these included both Indians  and Europeans. And I do not regret the experiences. In spite of  them, and in spite of the inconvenience and worry that I have often  caused to friends, I have not altered my conduct and friends have  kindly borne with me. Whenever my contacts with strangers have been  painful to friends, I have not hesitated to blame them. I hold that  believers who have to see the same God in others that they see in  themselves, must be able to live amongst all with sufficient  detachment. And the ability to live thus can be cultivated, not by  fighting shy of unsought opportunities for such contacts, but by  hailing them in a spirit of service and withal keeping oneself  unaffected by them.  Though, therefore, my house was full when the Boer War broke out, I  received two Englishmen who had come from Johannesburg. Both were  theosophists, one of them being Mr. Kitchin, of whom we shall have  occasion to know more later. These friends often cost my wife bitter  tears. Unfortunately she has had many such trials on my account.  This was the first time that I had English friends to live with me  as intimately as members of my family. I had stayed in English  houses during my days in England, but there I conformed to their  ways of living, and it was more or less like living in a boarding  house. Here it was quite the contrary. The English friends became  members of the family. They adopted the Indian style in many  matters. Though the appointments in the house were in the Western  fashion, the internal life was mostly Indian. I do remember having  had some difficulty in keeping them as members of the family, but I  can certainly say that they had no difficulty in making themselves  perfectly at home under my roof. In Johannesburg these contacts  developed further than in Durban.  A variety of incidents in my life have conspired to bring me in close  contact with people of many creeds and many communities, and my  experience with all of them warrants the statement that I have known  no distinction between relatives and strangers, countrymen and  foreigners, white and coloured, Hindus and Indians of other faiths,  whether Musalmans, Parsis, Christians or Jews. I may say that my  heart has been incapable of making any such distinctions. I cannot  claim this as a special virtue, as it is in my very nature, rather  than a result of any effort on my part, whereas in the case of ahimsa (non-violence), brahmacharya (celibacy),  aparigraha (non-possession) and other cardinal virtues, I am fully conscious of  a continuous striving for their cultivation.  When I was practising in Durban, my office clerks often stayed with  me, and there were among them Hindus and Christians, or to describe  them by their provinces, Gujaratis and Tamilians. I do not recollect  having ever regarded them as anything but my kith and kin. I treated  them as members of my family, and had unpleasantness with my wife if  ever she stood in the way of my treating them as such. One of the  clerks was a Christian, born of Panchama parents.  The house was built after the Western model and the rooms rightly  had no outlets for dirty water. Each room had therefore  chamber-pots. Rather than have these cleaned by a servant or a  sweeper, my wife or I attended to them. The clerks who made  themselves completely at home would naturally clean their own pots,  but the Christian clerk was a newcomer, and it was our duty to  attend to his bedroom. My wife managed the pots of the others, but  to clean those used by one who had been a Panchama seemed to her to  be the limit, and we fell out. She could not bear the pots being  cleaned by me, neither did she like doing it herself. Even today I  can recall the picture of her chiding me, her eyes red with anger,  and pearl drops streaming down her cheeks, as she descended the  ladder, pot in hand. But I was a cruelly kind husband. I regarded  myself as her teacher, and so harassed her out of my blind love for  her.  I was far from being satisfied by her merely carrying the pot. I  would have her do it cheerfully. So I said, raising my voice: 'I  will not stand this nonsense in my house.'  The words pierced her like an arrow.  She shouted back: 'Keep your house to yourself and let me go.' I  forgot myself, and the spring of compassion dried up in me. I caught  her by the hand, dragged the helpless woman to the gate, which was  just opposite the ladder, and proceeded to open it with the  intention of pushing her out. The tears were running down her cheeks  in torrents, and she cried: 'Have you no sense of shame? Must you so  far forget yourself? Where am I to go? I have no parents or  relatives here to harbour me. Being your wife, you think I must put  up with your cuffs and kicks? For Heaven's sake behave yourself, and  shut the gate. Let us not be found making scenes like this!'  I put on a brave face, but was really ashamed and shut the gate. If my  wife could not leave me, neither could I leave her. We have had  numerous bickerings, but the end has always been peace between us.  The wife, with her matchless powers of endurance, has always been  the victor.  Today I am in a position to narrate the incident with some  detachment, as it belongs to a period out of which I have  fortunately emerged. I am no longer a blind, infatuated husband, I  am no more my wife's teacher. Kasturba can, if she will, be as  unpleasant to me today, as I used to be to her before. We are tried  friends, the one no longer regarding the other as the object of  lust. She has been a faithful nurse throughout my illnesses, serving  without any thought of reward.  The incident in question occurred in , when I had no conception  of brahmacharya.  It was a time when I thought that the wife was the object of the  husband's lust, born to do her husband's behest, rather than a  helpmate, a comrade and a partner in the husband's joys and sorrows. It was in the year  that these ideas underwent a radical  transformation, and in  they took concrete shape. But of this I  propose to speak in its proper place. Suffice it to say that with  the gradual disappearance in me of the carnal appetite, my domestic  life became and is becoming more and more peaceful, sweet and happy. Let no one conclude from this narrative of a sacred recollection  that we are by any means an ideal couple, or that there is a  complete identity of ideals between us. Kasturba herself does not  perhaps know whether she has any ideals independently of me. It is  likely that many of my doings have not her approval even today. We  never discuss them, I see no good in discussing them. For she was  educated neither by her parents nor by me at the time when I ought  to have done it. But she is blessed with one great quality to a very  considerable degree, a quality which most Hindu wives possess in  some measure. And it is this; willingly or unwillingly, consciously  or unconsciously, she has considered herself blessed in following in  my footsteps, and has never stood in the way of my endeavour to lead  a life of restraint. Though, therefore, there is a wide difference  between us intellectually, I have always had the feeling that ours  is a life of contentment, happiness and progress.  It was no easy thing to issue the first number of  Indian Opinion from Phoenix. Had I not taken two precautions, the first issue would  have had to be dropped or delayed. The idea of having an engine to  work the press had not appealed to me. I had thought that hand-power  would be more in keeping with an atmosphere where agricultural work  was also to be done by hand. But as the idea had not appeared  feasible, we had installed an oil-engine. I had, however, suggested  to West to have something handy to fall back upon in case the engine  failed. He had therefore arranged a wheel which could be worked by  hand. The size of the paper, that of a daily, was considered  unsuitable for an out-of-the-way place like Phoenix. It was reduced  to foolscap size, so that, in case of emergency, copies might be  struck off with the help of a treadle.  In the initial stages, we all had to keep late hours before the day  of publication. Everyone, young and old, had to help in folding the  sheets. We usually finished our work between ten o'clock and  midnight. But the first night was unforgettable. We had got out an  engineer from Durban to put up the engine and set it going. He and  West tried their hardest, but in vain. Everyone was anxious. West,  in despair, at last came to me, with tears in his eyes, and said,  'The engine will not work, I am afraid we cannot issue the paper in  time.'  'If that is the case, we cannot help it. No use shedding tears. Let  us do whatever else is humanly possible. What about the hand-wheel?'  I said, comforting him.  'Where have we the men to work it?' he replied. 'We are not enough to  cope with the job. It requires relays of four men each, and our own  men are all tired.'  Building work had not yet been finished, so the  carpenters were still with us. They were sleeping on the press  floor. I said pointing to them, 'But can't we make use of these  carpenters? And we may have a whole night of work. I think this  device is still open to us.'  'I dare not wake up the carpenters. And our men are really too  tired,' said West.  'Well, that's for me to negotiate,' said I. 'Then it is possible that we may get through the work,' West  replied.  I woke up the carpenters and requested their co-operation. They  needed no pressure. They said, 'If we cannot be called upon in an  emergency, what use are we? You rest yourselves and we will work the  wheel. For us it is easy work.' Our own men were of course ready. West was greatly delighted and started singing a hymn as we set to  work. I partnered the carpenters, all the rest joined turn by turn,  and thus we went on until  a.m. There was still a good deal to do.  I therefore suggested to West that the engineer might now be asked  to get up and try again to start the engine, so that if we succeeded  we might finish in time.  West woke him up, and he immediately went into the engine room. And  lo and behold! the engine worked almost as soon as he touched it.  The whole press rang with peals of joy. 'How can this be? How is it  that all our labours last night were of no avail, and this morning  it has been set going as though there were nothing wrong with it?' I  enquired.  'It is difficult to say,' said West or the engineer, I forget which.  'Machines also sometimes seem to behave as though they required rest  like us.'  For me the failure of the engine had come as a test for us all, and  its working in the nick of time as the fruit of our honest and  earnest labours.  The copies were despatched in time, and everyone was happy.  This initial insistence ensured the regularity of the paper, and  created an atmosphere of self-reliance in Phoenix. There came a time  we deliberately gave up the use of the engine and worked with  hand-power only. Those were, to my mind, the days of the highest  moral uplift for Phoenix.  It has always been my regret that, although I started the Settlement at  Phoenix, I could stay there only for brief periods. My original idea  had been gradually to retire from practice, go and live at the  Settlement, earn my livelihood by manual work there, and find the  joy of service in the fulfillment of Phoenix. But it was not to be. I  have found by experience that man makes his plans to be often upset  by God, but, at the same time where the ultimate goal is the search  of truth, no matter how a man's plans are frustrated, the issue is  never injurious and often better than anticipated. The unexpected  turn that Phoenix took and the unexpected happenings were certainly  not injurious, though it is difficult to say that they were better  than our original expectations.  In order to enable every one of us to make a living by manual  labour, we parceled out the land round the press in pieces of three  acres each. One of these fell to my lot. On all these plots we, much  against our wish, built houses with corrugated iron. Our desire had  been to have mud huts thatched with straw or small brick houses such  as would become ordinary peasants, but it could not be. They would  have been more expensive and would have meant more time, and  everyone was eager to settle down as soon as possible.  The editor was still Mansukhlal Nazar. He had not accepted the new  scheme and was directing the paper from Durban where there was a  branch office for Indian Opinion. Though we had paid compositors,  the idea was for every member of the Settlement to learn  type-setting, the easiest, if the most tedious, of the processes in  a printing press. Those, therefore, who did not already know the  work learnt it. I remained a dunce to the last. Maganlal Gandhi  surpassed us all. Though he had never before worked in a press, he  became an expert compositor and not only achieved great speed but,  to my agreeable surprise, quickly mastered all the other branches of  press work. I have always thought that he was not conscious of his  own capacity.  We had hardly settled down, the buildings were hardly ready, when I  had to leave the newly constructed nest and go to Johannesburg. I  was not in a position to allow the work there to remain without  attention for any length of time.  On return to Johannesburg, I informed Polak of the important changes  I had made. His joy knew no bounds when he learnt that the loan of  his book had been so fruitful. 'Is it not possible,' he asked, 'for  me to take part in the new venture?'. 'Certainly,' said I. 'You may  if you like join the Settlement.' 'I am quite ready,' he replied,  'If you will admit me.'  His determination captured me. He gave a month's notice to his chief  to be relieved from The Critic, and reached Phoenix in due course.  By his sociability he won the hearts of all and soon became a member  of the family. Simplicity was so much a part of his nature that, far  from feeling the life at Phoenix in any way strange or hard, he took  to it like a duck takes to water. But I could not keep him there  long. Mr. Ritch had decided to finish his legal studies in England,  and it was impossible for me to bear the burden of the office  single-handed, so I suggested to Polak that he should join the  office and qualify as an attorney. I had thought that ultimately  both of us would retire and settle at Phoenix, but that never came  to pass. Polak's was such a trustful nature that, when he reposed  his confidence in a friend, he would try to agree with him instead  of arguing with him. He wrote to me from Phoenix that though he  loved the life there, was perfectly happy, and had hopes of  developing the Settlement, still he was ready to leave and join the  office to qualify as an attorney, if I thought that thereby we  should more quickly realize our ideals. I heartily welcomed the  letter. Polak left Phoenix, came to Johannesburg and signed his  articles with me.  About the same time a Scots theosophist, whom I had been coaching  for a local legal examination, also joined as an articled clerk, on  my inviting him to follow Polak's example. His name was Mr.  MacIntyre.  Thus, with the laudable object of quickly realizing the ideals at  Phoenix, I seemed to be going deeper and deeper into a contrary  current, and had God not willed otherwise, I should have found  myself entrapped in this net spread in the name of simple life.  It will be after a few more chapters that I shall describe how I and  my ideals were saved in a way no one had imagined or expected.  Before I proceed with the other intimate European contacts, I must note two  or three items of importance. One of the contacts, however, should  be mentioned at once. The appointment of Miss Dick was not enough  for my purpose. I needed more assistance. I have in the earlier  chapters referred to Mr. Ritch. I knew him very well. He was manager in a  commercial firm. He approved my suggestion of leaving the firm and  getting articled under me, and he considerably lightened my burden. About this time Sjt. Madanjit approached me with a proposal to start Indian Opinion and sought my advice. He had already been conducting a press, and I  approved of his proposal. The journal was launched in , and Sjt.  Mansukhlal Nazar became the first editor. But I had to bear the  brunt of the work, having for most of the time to be practically in  charge of the journal. Not that Sjt. Mansukhlal could not carry it  on. He had been doing a fair amount of journalism whilst in India,  but he would never venture to write on intricate South African  problems so long as I was there. He had the greatest confidence in  my discernment, and therefore threw on me the responsibility of  attending to the editorial columns. The journal has been until this  day a weekly. In the beginning it used to be issued in Gujarati,  Hindi, Tamil and English. I saw, however, that the Tamil and Hindi  sections were a make-believe. They did not serve the purpose for  which they were intended, so I discontinued them as I even felt that  there would be a certain amount of deception involved in their  continuance.  I had no notion that I should have to invest any money in this  journal, but I soon discovered that it could not go on without my  financial help. The Indians and the Europeans both knew that, though  I was not avowedly the editor of Indian Opinion,  I was virtually responsible for its conduct. It would not have  mattered if the journal had never been started, but to stop it after  it had once been launched would have been both a loss and a  disgrace. So I kept on pouring out my money, until ultimately I was  practically sinking all my savings in it. I remember a time when I  had to remit \u00a3 each month.  But after all these years I feel that the journal has served the  community well. It was never intended to be a commercial concern. So  long as it was under my control, the changes in the journal were  indicative of changes in my life.  Indian Opinion in those days, like Young India  and Navajivan today, was a mirror of part of my life. Week after week I poured out  my soul in its columns, and expounded the principles and practice of  Satyagraha as I understood it. During ten years, that is, until  , excepting the intervals of my enforced rest in prison, there  was hardly an issue of Indian Opinion  without an article from me. I cannot recall a word in those articles  set down without thought or deliberation, or a word of conscious  exaggeration, or anything merely to please. Indeed the journal  became for me a training in self-restraint, and for friends a medium  through which to keep in touch with my thoughts. The critic found  very little to which he could object. In fact the tone of  Indian Opinion compelled the critic to put a curb on his own pen. Satyagraha would  probably have been impossible without Indian Opinion.  The readers looked forward to it for a trustworthy account of the  Satyagraha campaign as also of the real condition of Indians in  South Africa. For me it became a means for the study of human nature  in all its casts and shades, as I always aimed at establishing an  intimate and clean bond between the editor and the readers. I was  inundated with letters containing the outpourings of my  correspondents' hearts. They were friendly, critical or bitter,  according to the temper of the writer. It was a fine education for me  to study, digest and answer all this correspondence. It was as  though the community thought audibly through this correspondence  with me. It made me thoroughly understand the responsibility of a  journalist, and the hold I secured in this way over the community  made the future campaign workable, dignified and irresistible. In the very first month of Indian Opinion,  I realized that the sole aim of journalism should be service. The  newspaper press is a great power, but just as an unchained torrent  of water submerges whole countrysides and devastates crops, even so  an uncontrolled pen serves but to destroy. If the control is from  without, it proves more poisonous than want of control. It can be  profitable only when exercised from within. If this line of  reasoning is correct, how many of the journals in the world would  stand the test? But who would stop those that are useless? And who  should be the judge? The useful and the useless must, like good and  evil generally, go on together, and man must make his choice.  In Johannesburg I had at one time as many as four Indian clerks, who  were perhaps more like my sons than clerks. But even these were not  enough for my work. It was impossible to do without typewriting,  which, among us, if at all, only I knew. I taught it to two of the  clerks, but they never came up to the mark because of their poor  English. And then one of these I wanted to train as an accountant. I  could not get anyone from Natal, for nobody could enter the  Transvaal without a permit, and for my own personal convenience I  was not prepared to ask a favour of the Permit Officer. I was at my wits' end. Arrears were fast mounting up, so much so  that it seemed impossible for me, however much I might try, to cope  with professional and public work. I was quite willing to engage a  European clerk, but I was not sure to get a white man or woman to  serve a coloured man like myself. However I decided to try. I  approached a typewriting agent whom I knew, and asked him to get me  a stenographer. There were girls available, and he promised to try  to secure the services of one. He came across a Scots girl called  Miss Dick, who had just come fresh from Scotland. She had no  objection to earning an honest livelihood, wherever available, and  she was in need. So the agent sent her on to me. She immediately  prepossessed me.  'Don't you mind serving under an Indian?' I asked her.  'Not at all,' was her firm reply.  'What salary do you expect?'  'Would \u00a3  s be too much?'  'Not too much if you will give me the work I want from you. When can  you join?'  'This moment, if you wish.'  I was very pleased and straightaway started dictating letters to  her.  Before very long she became more a daughter or a sister to me than a  mere stenotypist. I had scarcely any reason to find fault with her  work. She was often entrusted with the management of funds amounting  to thousands of pounds, and she was in charge of account books. She  won my complete confidence, but what was perhaps more, she confided  to me her innermost thoughts and feelings. She sought my advice in  the final choice of her husband, and I had the privilege to give her  away in marriage. As soon as Miss Dick became Mrs. Macdonald, she  had to leave me, but even after her marriage she did not fail to  respond, whenever under pressure I made a call upon her. But a permanent stenotypist was now needed in her place, and I was  fortunate in getting another girl. She was Miss Schlesin, introduced  to me by Mr. Kallenbach, whom the reader will know in due course.  She is at present a teacher in one of the High Schools in the  Transvaal. She was about seventeen when she came to me. Some of her  idiosyncrasies were at times too much for Mr. Kallenbach and me. She  had come less to work as a stenotypist than to gain experience.  Colour prejudice was foreign to her temperament. She seemed to mind  neither age nor experience. She would not hesitate even to the point  of insulting a man and telling him to his face what she thought of  him. Her impetuosity often landed me in difficulties, but her open  and guileless temperament removed them as soon as they were created.  I have often signed without revision letters typed by her, as I  considered her English to be better than mine, and had the fullest  confidence in her loyalty.  Her sacrifice was great. For a considerable period she did not draw  more than \u00a3, and refused ever to receive more than \u00a3 a month.  When I urged her to take more, she would give me a scolding and say,  'I am not here to draw a salary from you. I am here because I like to  work with you and I like your ideals.'  She had once an occasion to take \u00a3 from me, but she insisted on  having it as a loan, and repaid the full amount last year. Her  courage was equal to her sacrifice. She is one of the few women I  have been privileged to come across, with a character as clear as  crystal and courage that would shame a warrior. She is a grown up  woman now. I do not know her mind quite as well as when she was with  me, but my contact with this young lady will ever be for me a sacred  recollection. I would therefore be false to truth if I kept back  what I know about her.  She knew neither night nor day in toiling for the cause. She  ventured out on errands in the darkness of the night all by herself,  and angrily scouted any suggestion of an escort. Thousands of  stalwart Indians looked up to her for guidance. When during the  Satyagraha days almost every one of the leaders was in jail, she led  the movement single-handed. She had the management of thousands, a  tremendous amount of correspondence, and Indian Opinion  in her hands, but she never wearied.  I could go on without end writing thus about Miss Schlesin, but I  shall conclude this chapter with citing Gokhale's estimate of her.  Gokhale knew every one of my co-workers. He was pleased with many of  them, and would often give his opinion of them. He gave the first  place to Miss Schlesin amongst all the Indian and European  co-workers. 'I have rarely met with the sacrifice, the purity and  the fearlessness I have seen in Miss Schlesin,' said he. 'Amongst  your co-workers, she takes the first place in my estimation.'  Indians were not removed from the location as soon as the  Municipality secured its ownership. It was necessary to find the  residents suitable new quarters before dislodging them, but as the  Municipality could not easily do this, the Indians were suffered to  stay in the same 'dirty' location, with this difference, that their  condition became worse than before. Having ceased to be proprietors  they became tenants of the Municipality, with the result that their  surroundings became more insanitary than ever. When they were  proprietors, they had to maintain some sort of cleanliness, if only  for fear of the law. The Municipality had no such fear! The number  of tenants increased, and with them the squalor and the disorder. While the Indians were fretting over this state of things, there was  a sudden outbreak of the black plague, also called the pneumonic  plague, more terrible and fatal than the bubonic.  Fortunately it was not the location but one of the gold mines in the  vicinity of Johannesburg that was responsible for the outbreak. The  workers in this mine were for the most part negroes, for whose  cleanliness their white employers were solely responsible. There  were a few Indians also working in connection with the mine,  twenty-three of whom suddenly caught the infection, and returned one  evening to their quarters in the location with an acute attack of  the plague. Sjt. Madanjit, who was then canvassing subscribers for Indian Opinion and realizing subscriptions, happened to be in the location at this  moment. He was a remarkably fearless man. His heart wept to see  these victims of the scourge, and he sent a pencil-note to me to  the following effect: 'There has been a sudden outbreak of the black  plague. You must come immediately and take prompt measures,  otherwise we must be prepared for dire consequences. Please come  immediately.' Sjt. Madanjit bravely broke open the lock of a vacant  house, and put all the patients there. I cycled to the location, and  wrote to the Town Clerk to inform him of the circumstances in which  we had taken possession of the house. Dr. William Godfrey, who was practising in Johannesburg, ran to the  rescue as soon as he got the news, and became both nurse and doctor  to the patients. But twenty-three patients were more than three of  us could cope with. It is my faith, based on experience, that if one's heart is pure,  calamity brings in its train men and measures to fight it. I had at  that time four Indians in my office \u2013 Sjts. Kalyandas, Maneklal,  Gunvantrai Desai and another whose name I cannot recollect.  Kalyandas had been entrusted to me by his father. In South Africa I  have rarely come across anyone more obliging and willing to render  implicit obedience than Kalyandas. Fortunately he was unmarried  then, and I did not hesitate to impose on him duties involving  risks, however great. Maneklal I had secured in Johannesburg. He too,  so far as I can remember, was unmarried. So I decided to sacrifice  all four \u2013 call them clerks, co-workers or sons. There was no need  at all to consult Kalyandas. The others expressed their readiness as  soon as they were asked. 'Where you are, we will also be,' was their  short and sweet reply. Mr. Ritch had a large family. He was ready to take the plunge, but I  prevented him. I had not the heart to expose him to the risk. So he  attended to the work outside the danger zone. It was a terrible night  \u2013 that night of vigil and nursing. I had  nursed a number of patients before, but never any attacked by the  black plague. Dr. Godfrey's pluck proved infectious. There was not  much nursing required. To give them their doses of medicine, to  attend to their wants, to keep them and their beds clean and tidy,  and to cheer them up was all that we had to do. The indefatigable zeal and fearlessness with which the youths worked  rejoiced me beyond measure. One could understand the bravery of Dr.  Godfrey and of an experienced man like Sjt. Madanjit. But the spirit  of these callow youths! So far as I can recollect, we pulled all the patients through that  night. But the whole incident, apart from its pathos, is of such absorbing  interest and, for me, of such religious value, that I must devote to  it at least two more chapters.  Some of the classes which render us the greatest social service, but  which we Hindus have chosen to regard as 'untouchables,' are relegated to remote quarters of a town or a village,  called in Gujarati dhedvado, and the name has acquired a bad odour. Even so in Christian Europe  the Jews were once 'untouchables,' and the quarters that were  assigned to them had the offensive name of 'ghettoes'. In a similar  way today we have become the untouchables of South Africa. It  remains to be seen how far the sacrifice of Andrews and the magic  wand of Sastri succeed in rehabilitating us.  The ancient Jews regarded themselves as the chosen people of God, to  the exclusion of all others, with the result that their descendants  were visited with a strange and even unjust retribution. Almost in a  similar way the Hindus have considered themselves Aryas  or civilized, and a section of their own kith and kin as Anaryas  or untouchables, with the result that a strange, if unjust nemesis  is being visited not only upon the Hindus in South Africa, but the Musalmans and Parsis as well, inasmuch as they belong to the same country and have the same colour as their Hindu brethren. The reader will have now realized to some extent the meaning of the  word 'locations' with which I have headed this chapter. In South  Africa we have acquired the odious name of 'coolies'. The word  'coolie' in India means only a porter or hired workman, but in South  Africa it has a contemptuous connotation. It means what a pariah or  an untouchable means to us, and the quarters assigned to the  'coolies' are known as 'coolie locations'. Johannesburg had one such  location, but unlike other places with locations where the Indians  had tenancy rights, here they acquired their plots on a lease of ninety-nine years. People were densely  packed in the location, the area of which never increased with the  increase in population. Beyond arranging to clean the latrines in  the location in a haphazard way, the Municipality did nothing to  provide any sanitary facilities, much less good roads or lights. It  was hardly likely that it would safeguard its sanitation, when it  was indifferent to the welfare of the residents. These were too  ignorant of the rules of municipal sanitation and hygiene to do  without the help or supervision of the Municipality. If those who  went there had all been Robinson Crusoes, theirs would have been a  different story. But we do not know of a single emigrant colony of  Robinson Crusoes in the world. Usually people migrate abroad in  search of wealth and trade, but the bulk of the Indians who went to  South Africa were ignorant, pauper agriculturists, who needed all  the care and protection that could be given them. The traders and  educated Indians who followed them were very few.  The criminal negligence of the Municipality and the ignorance of the  Indian settlers thus conspired to render the location thoroughly  insanitary. The Municipality, far from doing anything to improve the  condition of the location, used the insanitation, caused by their  own neglect, as a pretext for destroying the location, and for that  purpose obtained from the local legislature authority to dispossess  the settlers. This was the condition of things when I settled in  Johannesburg.  The settlers, having proprietary rights in their land, were  naturally entitled to compensation. A special tribunal was appointed  to try the land acquisition cases. If the tenant was not prepared to  accept the offer of the Municipality, he had a right to appeal to  the tribunal, and if the latter's award exceeded the Municipality's  offer, the Municipality had to bear the costs.  Most of the tenants engaged me as their legal adviser. I had no  desire to make money out of these cases, so I told the tenants that  I should be satisfied with whatever costs the tribunal awarded, in  case they won, and a fee of \u00a3 on every lease, irrespective of the  result of the case. I also told them that I proposed to set apart  half of the money paid by them for the building of a hospital or  similar institution for the poor. This naturally pleased them all.  Out of about seventy cases only one was lost. So the fees amounted to a  fairly big figure. But Indian Opinion was there with its persistent claim and devoured, so far as I can  recollect, a sum of \u00a3,. I had worked hard for these cases. The  clients always surrounded me. Most of them were originally  indentured labourers from South India. For the redress of their peculiar grievances they had formed  an association of their own, separate from that of the free Indian  merchants and traders. Some of them were open- hearted, liberal men  and had high character. Their leaders were Sjt. Jairamsing, the  president, and Sjt. Badri, who was as good as the president. Both of  them are now no more. They were exceedingly helpful to me. Sjt.  Badri came in very close contact with me and took a prominent part  in Satyagraha. Through these and other friends I came in intimate  contact with numerous Indian settlers from North and South India. I  became more their brother than a mere legal adviser, and shared in  all their private and public sorrows and hardships.  It may be of some interest to know how the Indians used to name me.  Abdulla Sheth refused to address me as Gandhi. None, fortunately,  ever insulted me by calling or regarding me as 'saheb'. Abdulla  Sheth hit upon a fine appellation-'bhai', i.e., brother. Others  followed him and continued to address me as 'bhai' until the moment  I left South Africa. There was a sweet flavour about the name when  it was used by the ex-indentured Indians.   Though my co-workers and I were relieved of the charge of the patients,  there remained many things arising out of the black plague still to be dealt with.  I have referred to the negligence of the Municipality regarding the  location. But it was wide awake so far as the health of its white  citizens was concerned. It had spent large amounts for the  preservation of their health and now it poured forth money like  water in order to stamp out the plague. In spite of the many sins of  omission and commission against the Indians that I had laid at the  door of the Municipality, I could not help commending its solicitude  for the white citizens, and I rendered it as much help as I could in  its laudable efforts. I have an impression that, if I had withheld  my co-operation, the task would have been more difficult for the  Municipality, and that it would not have hesitated to use armed  force and do its worst.  But all that was averted. The Municipal authorities were pleased at  the Indians' behaviour, and much of the future work regarding plague  measures was simplified. I used all the influence I could   with the Indians to make them submit to the\u00a0 Municipality's  requirements, and I do not remember anyone having resisted my advice.  The location was put under a strong guard, passage in and out being  made impossible without permission. My co-workers and I had free  permits of entry and exit. The decision was to make the whole  location population vacate, and live under canvas for three weeks in  an open plain about thirteen miles from Johannesburg, and then to  set fire to the location. To settle down under canvas with  provisions and other necessaries was bound to take some time, and a  guard became necessary during the interval.  The people were in a terrible fright, but my constant presence was a consolation to them.  Many of the poor people used to hoard their scanty savings  underground. This had to be unearthed. They had no bank, they knew  none. I became their banker. Streams of money poured into my office.  I could not possibly charge any fees for my labours in such a  crisis. I coped with the work somehow. I knew my bank manager very  well. I told him that I should have to deposit these moneys with  him. The banks were by no means anxious to accept large amounts of  copper and silver. There was also the fear of bank clerks refusing  to touch money coming from a plague-affected area. But the manager  accommodated me in every way. It was decided to disinfect all the  money before sending it to the bank. So far as I can remember,  nearly sixty thousand pounds were thus deposited. I advised such of  the people as had enough money to place it as fixed deposit, and  they accepted the advice. The result was some of them became  accustomed to invest their money in banks.  The location residents were removed by special train to Klipspruit  Farm near Johannesburg, where they were supplied with provisions by  the Municipality at public expense. This city under canvas looked  like a military camp. The people who were unaccustomed to this camp  life were distressed and astonished over the arrangements, but they  did not have to put up with any particular inconvenience. I used to  cycle out to them daily. Within twenty-four hours of their stay they  forgot all their misery and began to live merrily. Whenever I went  there I found them enjoying themselves with song and mirth. Three  weeks' stay in the open air evidently improved their health.  So far as I recollect, the location was put to the flames on the  very next day after its evacuation. The Municipality showed not the  slightest inclination to save anything from the conflagration. About  this very time, and for the same reason, the Municipality burnt down  all its timber in the market, and sustained a loss of some \u00a3,. The reason for this drastic step was the discovery  of some dead rats in the market.  The Municipality had to incur heavy expenditure, but it successfully  arrested the further progress of the plague, and the city once more  breathed freely.  The Town Clerk expressed his gratitude to me for having taken charge of  the vacant house and the patients. He frankly confessed that the  Town Council had no immediate means to cope with such an emergency,  but promised that they would render all the help in their power.  Once awakened to a sense of their duty, the Municipality made no  delay in taking prompt measures.  The next day they placed a vacant godown at my disposal, and suggested that the patients be removed  there, but the Municipality did not undertake to clean the premises.  The building was unkempt and unclean. We cleaned it up ourselves,  raised a few beds and other necessaries through the offices of  charitable Indians, and improvised a temporary hospital. The  Municipality lent the services of a nurse, who came with brandy and  other hospital equipment. Dr. Godfrey still remained in charge.  The nurse was a kindly lady and would fain have attended to the  patients, but we rarely allowed her to touch them, lest she should  catch the contagion.  We had instructions to give the patients frequent doses of brandy.  The nurse even asked us to take it for precaution, just as she was  doing herself. But none of us would touch it. I had no faith in its  beneficial effect even for the patients. With the permission of Dr.  Godfrey, I put three patients, who were prepared to do without  brandy, under the earth treatment, applying wet earth bandages to  their heads and chests. Two of these were saved. The other twenty  died in the godown.  Meanwhile the Municipality was busy taking other measures. There was  a lazaretto for contagious diseases about seven miles from  Johannesburg. The two surviving patients were removed to tents near  the lazaretto, and arrangements were made for sending any fresh  cases there. We were thus relieved of our work.  In the course of a few days we learnt that the good nurse had had an  attack and immediately succumbed. It is impossible to say how the  two patients were saved and how we remained immune, but the  experience enhanced my faith in earth treatment, as also my scepticism of the efficacy of brandy, even as a medicine. I know  that neither this faith nor this scepticism is based upon any solid  grounds, but I still retain the impression which I then received,  and have therefore thought it necessary to mention it here.  On the outbreak of the plague, I had addressed a strong letter to  the press, holding the Municipality guilty of negligence after the  location came into its possession and responsible for the outbreak  of the plague itself. This letter secured me Mr. Henry Polak, and  was partly responsible for the friendship of the late Rev. Joseph  Doke.  I have said in an earlier chapter that I used to have my meals at a  vegetarian restaurant. Here I met Mr. Albert West. We used to meet  in this restaurant every evening and go out walking after dinner.  Mr. West was a partner in a small printing concern. He read my  letter in the press about the outbreak of the plague and, not  finding me in the restaurant, felt uneasy.  My co-workers and I had reduced our diet since the outbreak, as I  had long made it a rule to go on a light diet during epidemics. In  these days I had therefore given up my evening dinner. Lunch also I  would finish before the other guests arrived. I knew the proprietor  of the restaurant very well, and I had informed him that, as I was  engaged in nursing the plague patients, I wanted to avoid the  contact of friends as much as possible.  Not finding me in the restaurant for a day or two, Mr. West knocked  at my door early one morning just as I was getting ready to go out  for a walk. As I opened the door Mr. West said: 'I did not find you  in the restaurant and was really afraid lest something should have  happened to you. So I decided to come and see you in the morning in  order to make sure of finding you at home. Well, here I am at your  disposal. I am ready to help in nursing the patients. You know that  I have no one depending on me.'  I expressed my gratitude, and without taking even a second to think,  replied: 'I will not have you as a nurse. If there are no more  cases, we shall be free in a day or two. There is one thing  however.'  'Yes, what is it?'  'Could you take charge of the Indian Opinion press at Durban? Mr. Madanjit is likely to be engaged here, and  someone is needed at Durban. If you could go, I should feel quite  relieved on that score.'  'You know that I have a press. Most probably I shall be able to go,  but may I give my final reply in the evening? We shall talk it over  during our evening walk.' I was delighted. We had the talk. He agreed to go. Salary was no  consideration to him, as money was not his motive, But a salary \u00a3  per month and a part of the profits, if any, was fixed up. The very  next day Mr. West left for Durban by the evening mail, entrusting me  with the recovery of his dues. From that day until the time I left  the shores of South Africa, he remained a partner of my joys and  sorrows.  Mr. West belonged to a peasant family in Louth (Lincolnshire). He  had had an ordinary school education, but had learnt a good deal in the  school of experience and by dint of self-help. I have always known  him to be a pure, sober, god-fearing, humane Englishman. We shall know more of him and his family in the chapters to follow.  I talked over the whole thing with Mr. West, described to him the  effect Unto This Last had produced on my mind, and proposed that  Indian Opinion should be removed to a farm, on which everyone should labour,  drawing the same living wage, and attending to the press work in  spare time. Mr. West approved of the proposal, and \u00a3 was laid down  as the monthly allowance per head, irrespective of colour or  nationality.  But it was a question whether all the ten or more workers in the  press would agree to go and settle on an out-of-the-way farm, and be  satisfied with bare maintenance. We therefore proposed that those  who could not fit in with the scheme should continue to draw their  salaries and gradually try to reach the ideal of becoming members of  the settlement.  I talked to the workers in the terms of this proposal. It did not  appeal to Sjt. Madanjit, who considered my proposal to be foolish  and held that it would ruin a venture on which he had staked his  all; that the workers would bolt,  Indian Opinion would come to a stop, and the press would have to be closed down. Among the men working in the press was Chhaganlal Gandhi, one of my  cousins. I had put the proposal to him at the same time as to West.  He had a wife and children, but he had from childhood chosen to be  trained and to work under me. He had full faith in me. So without  any argument he agreed to the scheme and has been with me ever  since. The machinist Govindaswami also fell in with the proposal.  The rest did not join the scheme, but agreed to go wherever I  removed the press.  I do not think I took more than two days to fix up these matters  with the men. Thereafter I at once advertised for a piece of land  situated near a railway station in the vicinity of Durban. An offer  came in respect of Phoenix. Mr. West and I went to inspect the  estate. Within a week we purchased twenty acres of land. It had a  nice little spring and a few orange and mango trees. Adjoining it  was a piece of  acres which had many more fruit trees and a  dilapidated cottage. We purchased this too, the total cost being a  thousand pounds.  The late Mr. Rustomji always supported me in such enterprises. He  liked the project. He placed at my disposal second-hand corrugated  iron sheets of a big godown and other building material, with which  we started work. Some Indian carpenters and masons, who had worked  with me in the Boer War, helped me in erecting a shed for the press.  This structure, which was seventy-five feet long and fifty feet broad, was ready  in less than a month. Mr. West and others, at great personal risk,  stayed with the carpenters and masons. The place, uninhabited and  thickly overgrown with grass, was infested with snakes and obviously  dangerous to live in. At first all lived under canvas. We carted  most of our things to Phoenix in about a week. It was  miles  from Durban, and two and a half miles from Phoenix station.  Only one issue of Indian Opinion  had to be printed outside, in the Mercury press.  I now endeavoured to draw to Phoenix those relations and friends who  had come with me from India to try their fortune, and who were  engaged in business of various kinds. They had come in search of  wealth, and it was therefore difficult to persuade them; but some  agreed. Of these I can single out here only Manganlal Gandhi's name.  The others went back to business. Manganlal Gandhi left his business  for good to cast in his lot with me, and by ability, sacrifice and  devotion stands foremost among my original co-workers in my ethical  experiments. As a self-taught handicraftsman his place among them is  unique. Thus the Phoenix Settlement was started in , and there in spite  of numerous odds Indian Opinion continues to be published.  But the initial difficulties, the changes made, the hopes and the  disappointments demand a separate chapter.  The black plague enhanced my influence with the poor Indians, and  increased my business and my responsibility. Some of the new  contacts with Europeans became so close that they added considerably  to my moral obligations.  I made the acquaintance of Mr. Polak in the vegetarian restaurant,  just as I had made that of Mr. West. One evening a young man dining  at a table a little way off sent me his card expressing a desire to  see me. I invited him to come to my table, which he did.  'I am sub-editor of the The Critic,' he said 'When I read your letter to the press about the plague, I  felt a strong desire to see you. I am glad to have this opportunity.'  Mr. Polak's candour drew me to him. The same evening we got to know  each other. We seemed to hold closely similar views on the essential  things of life. He liked simple life. He had a wonderful faculty of  translating into practice anything that appealed to his intellect.  Some of the changes that he had made in his life were as prompt as  they were radical.  Indian Opinion was getting more and more expensive every day. The very first report  from Mr. West was alarming. He wrote: 'I do not expect the concern  to yield the profit that you had thought probable. I am afraid there  may be even a loss. The books are not in order. There are heavy  arrears to be recovered, but one cannot make head or tail of them.  Considerable overhauling will have to be done. But all this need not  alarm you. I shall try to put things right as best I can. I remain  on, whether there is profit or not.'  Mr. West might have left when he discovered that there was no  profit, and I could not have blamed him. In fact, he had a right to  arraign me for having described the concern as profitable without  proper proof. But he never so much as uttered one word of complaint.  I have, however, an impression that this discovery led Mr. West to  regard me as credulous. I had simply accepted Sjt. Madanjit's  estimate without caring to examine it, and told Mr. West to expect a  profit.  I now realize that a public worker should not make statements of  which he has not made sure. Above all, a votary of truth must  exercise the greatest caution. To allow a man to believe a thing  which one has not fully verified is to compromise truth. I am pained to  have to confess that, in spite of this knowledge, I have not quite  conquered my credulous habit, for which my ambition to do more work  than I can manage is responsible. This ambition has often been a  source of worry more to my co-workers than to myself.  On receipt of Mr. West's letter I left for Natal. I had taken Mr.  Polak into my fullest confidence. He came to see me off at the  station, and left with me a book to read during the journey, which  he said I was sure to like. It was Ruskin's Unto This Last. The book was impossible to lay aside, once I had begun it. It  gripped me. Johannesburg to Durban was a twenty-four hours' journey.  The train reached there in the evening. I could not get any sleep  that night. I determined to change my life in accordance with the  ideals of the book.  This was the first book of Ruskin I had ever read. During the days  of my education I had read practically nothing outside text-books,  and after I launched into active life I had very little time for  reading. I cannot therefore claim much book knowledge. However, I  believe I have not lost much because of this enforced restraint. On  the contrary, the limited reading may be said to have enabled me  thoroughly to digest what I did read. Of these books, the one that  brought about an instantaneous and practical transformation in my  life was Unto This Last.  I translated it later into Gujarati, entitling it Sarvodaya  (the welfare of all).  I believe that I discovered some of my deepest convictions reflected  in this great book of Ruskin, and that is why it so captured me and  made me transform my life. A poet is one who can call forth the good  latent in the human breast. Poets do not influence all alike, for  everyone is not evolved in an equal measure.  The teaching of Unto This Last I understood to be:  . That the good of the individual is contained in the good of all. . That a lawyer's work has the same value as the barber's inasmuch  as all have the same right of earning their livehood from their work.  . That a life of labour, i.e., the life of the tiller of the soil  and the handicraftsman, is the life worth living. The first of these  I knew. The second I had dimly realized. The third had never occured to me.  Unto This Last made it as clear as daylight for me that the second and the third  were contained in the first. I arose with the dawn, ready to reduce  these principles to practice.  Mr. Chamberlain had come to get a gift of  million pounds from South  Africa, and to win the hearts of Englishmen and Boers. So he gave a  cold shoulder to the Indian deputation.  'You know,' he said 'that the Imperial Government has little control  over self-governing Colonies. Your grievances seem to be genuine. I  shall do what I can, but you must try your best to placate the  Europeans, if you wish to live in their midst.'  The reply cast a chill over the members of the deputation. I was  also disappointed. It was an eye-opener for us all, and I saw that  we should start with our work de novo.  I explained the situation to my colleagues.  As a matter of fact there was nothing wrong about Mr. Chamberlain's  reply. It was well that he did not mince matters. He had brought  home to us in a rather gentle way the rule of might being right or  the law of the sword.  But sword we had none. We scarcely had the nerve and the muscle even  to receive sword-cuts.  Mr. Chamberlain had given only a short time to the sub-continent. If  Shrinagar to Cape Comorin is , miles, Durban to Capetown is not  less than , miles, and Mr. Chamberlain had to cover the long  distance at hurricane speed.  From Natal he hastened to the Transvaal. I had to prepare the case  for the Indians there as well and submit it to him. But how was I  to get to Pretoria? Our people there were not in a position to procure  the necessary legal facilities for my getting to them in time. The  War had reduced the Transvaal to a howling wilderness. There were  neither provisions nor clothing available. Empty or closed shops  were there, waiting to be replenished or opened, but that was a  matter of time. Even refugees could not be allowed to return until  the shops were ready with provisions. Every Transvaaller had  therefore to obtain a permit. The European had no difficulty in  getting one, but the Indian found it very hard.  During the War many officers and soldiers had come to South Africa  from India and Ceylon, and it was considered to be the duty of the  British authorities to provide for such of them as decided to settle  there. They had in any event to appoint new officers, and these  experienced men came in quite handy. The quick ingenuity of some of  them created a new department. It showed their resourcefulness.  There was a special department for the negroes. Why then should  there not be one for the Asiatics? The argument seemed to be quite  plausible. When I reached the Transvaal, this new department had  already been opened and was gradually spreading its tentacles. The  officers who issued permits to the returning refugees might issue  them to all, but how could they do so in respect of the Asiatics  without the intervention of the new department? And if the permits  were to be issued on the recommendation of the new department, some  of the responsibility and burden of the permit officers could thus  be lessened. This was how they had argued. The fact, however, was  that the new department wanted some apology for work, and the men  wanted money. If there had been no work, the department would have  been unnecessary and would have been discontinued. So they found  this work for themselves.  The Indians had to apply to this department. A reply would be  vouchsafed many days after. And as there were large numbers wishing  to return to the Transvaal, there grew up an army of intermediaries  or touts, who with the officers, looted the poor Indians to the tune  of thousands. I was told that no permit could be had without  influence, and that in some cases one had to pay up to a hundred pounds  in spite of the influence which one might bring to  bear. Thus there seemed to me no way open to me. I went to my old friend,  the Police Superintendent of Durban, and said to him: 'Please  introduce me to the Permit Officer and help me to obtain a permit.  You know that I have been a resident of the Transvaal.' He  immediately put on his hat, came out and secured me a permit. There  was hardly an hour left before my train was to start. I had kept my  luggage ready. I thanked Superintendent Alexander and started for  Pretoria.  I now had a fair idea of the difficulties ahead. On reaching  Pretoria I drafted the memorial. In Durban I do not recollect the  Indians having been asked to submit in advance the names of their  representatives, but here there was the new department and it asked  to do so. The Pretoria Indians had already come to know that the  officers wanted to exclude me.  But another chapter is necessary for this painful though amusing  incident. I smarted under the insult, but as I had pocketed many such in the  past I had become inured to them. I therefore decided to forget this  latest one and take what course a dispassionate view of the case  might suggest. We had a letter from the Chief of the Asiatic  Department to the effect that, as I had seen Mr. Chamberlain in  Durban, it had been found necessary to omit  my name from the deputation which was to wait on him. The letter was more than my co-workers could bear. They proposed to  drop the idea of the deputation altogether. I pointed out to them  the awkward situation of the community. If you do not represent your case before Mr. Chamberlain,' said I,  'it will be presumed that you have no case at all. After all, the  representation has to be made in writing, and we have got it ready.  It does not matter in the least whether I read it or someone else  reads it. Mr. Chamberlain is not going to argue the matter with us.  I am afraid we must swallow the insult.' I had scarcely finished speaking when Tyeb Sheth cried out, 'Does  not an insult to you amount to an insult to the community? How can  we forget that you are our representative?' 'Too true,' said I. 'But even the community will have to pocket  insults like these. Have we any alternative?' 'Come what may, why should we swallow a fresh insult? Nothing worse  can possibly happen to us. Have we many rights to lose?' asked Tyeb  Sheth. It was a spirited reply, but of what avail was it? I was fully  conscious of the limitations of the community. I pacified my friends  and advised them to have, in my place, Mr. George Godfrey, an Indian  barrister. So Mr. Godfrey led the deputation. Mr. Chamberlain  referred in his reply to my exclusion. 'Rather than hear the same  representative over and over again, is it not better to have someone  new?' he said, and tried to heal the wound. But all this, far from ending the matter, only added to the work of  the community and also to mine. We had to start afresh. 'It is at your instance that the community helped in the war, and  you see the result now,' were the words with which some people  taunted me. But the taunt had no effect. 'I do not regret my  advice,' said I. 'I maintain that we did well in taking part in the  war. In doing so we simply did our duty. We may not look forward to  any reward for our labours, but it is my firm conviction that all  good action is bound to bear fruit in the end. Let us forget the  past and think of the task before us.' With which the rest agreed. I added: 'To tell you the truth, the work for which you had called me  is practically finished. But I believe I ought not to leave the  Transvaal, so far as it is possible, even if you permit me to return  home. Instead of carrying on my work from Natal, as before, I must  now do so from here. I must no longer think of returning to India  within a year, but must get enrolled in the Transvaal Supreme Court.  I have confidence enough to deal with this new department. If we do  not do this, the community will be hounded out of the country,  besides being thoroughly robbed. Every day it will have fresh insults heaped upon  it. The facts that Mr. Chamberlain refused to see me and that the  official insulted me, are nothing before the humiliation of the  whole community. It will become impossible to put up with the  veritable dog's life that we shall be expected to lead.'  So I set the ball rolling, discussed things with Indians in Pretoria  and Johannesburg, and ultimately decided to set up office in  Johannesburg.  It was indeed doubtful whether I would be enrolled in  the Transvaal Supreme Court. But the Law Society did not oppose my  application, and the Court allowed it. It was difficult for an  Indian to secure rooms for office in a suitable locality. But I had  come in fairly close contact with Mr. Ritch, who was then one of the  merchants there. Through the good offices of a house agent known to  him, I succeeded in securing suitable rooms for my office in the  legal quarters of the city, and I started on my professional work. The officers at the head of the new department were at a loss to know  how I had entered the Transvaal. They inquired of the Indians who  used to go to them, but these could say nothing definite. The  officers only ventured a guess that I might have succeeded in  entering without a permit on the strength of my old connections. If  that was the case, I was liable to be arrested!  It is a general practice, on the termination of a big war, to invest  the government of the day with special powers. This was the case in  South Africa. The government had passed a Peace Preservation  Ordinance, which provided that anyone entering the Transvaal without  a permit should be liable to arrest and imprisonment. The question  of arresting me under this provision was mooted, but no one could  summon up courage enough to ask me to produce my permit.  The officers had of course sent telegrams to Durban, and when they found  that I had entered with a permit, they were disappointed. But they  were not the men to be defeated by such disappointment. Though I had  succeeded in entering the Transvaal, they could still successfully  prevent me from waiting on Mr. Chamberlain.  So the community was asked to submit the names of the representatives  who were to form the Deputation. Colour prejudice was of course in  evidence everywhere in South Africa, but I was not prepared to find  here the dirty and underhand dealing among officials that I was  familiar with in India. In South Africa the public departments were  maintained for the good of the people and were responsible to public  opinion. Hence officials in charge had a certain courtesy of manner  and humility about them, and coloured people also got the benefit of  it more or less. With the coming of the officers from Asia, came  also its autocracy, and the habits that the autocrats had imbibed  there. In South Africa there was a kind of responsible government or  democracy, whereas the commodity imported from Asia was autocracy  pure and simple; for the Asiatics had no responsible government,  there being a foreign power governing them. In South Africa the  Europeans were settled emigrants. They had become South African  citizens and had control over the departmental officers. But the  autocrats from Asia now appeared on the scene, and the Indians in  consequence found themselves between the devil and the deep sea. I had a fair taste of this autocracy. I was first summoned to see  the chief of the department, an officer from Ceylon. Lest I should  appear to exaggerate when I say that I was 'summoned' to see the  chief, I shall make myself clear. No written order was sent to me.  Indian leaders often had to visit the Asiatic officers. Among these  was the late Sheth Tyeb Haji Khanmahomed. The chief of the office  asked him who I was and why I had come there.  'He is our adviser,' said Tyeb Sheth, 'and he has come here at our  request.'  'Then what are we here for? Have we not been appointed to protect  you? What can Gandhi know of the conditions here?' asked the  autocrat.  Tyeb Sheth answered the charge as best he could: 'Of course you are  there. But Gandhi is our man. He knows our language and understands  us. You are after all officials.'  The Sahib ordered Tyeb Sheth to fetch me before him. I went to the  Sahib in company with Tyeb Sheth and others. No seats were offered,  we were all kept standing.  'What brings you here?' said the Sahib addressing me.  'I have come here at the request of my fellow countrymen to help  them with my advice,' I replied.  'But don't you know that you have no right to come here? The permit  you hold was given you by mistake.\u00a0 You cannot be regarded as a  domiciled Indian. You must go back. You shall not  wait on Mr. Chamberlain. It is for the protection of the Indians  here that the Asiatic Department has been especially created. Well,  you may go.' With this he bade me good-bye, giving me no opportunity  for a reply.  But he detained my companions. He gave them a sound scolding and  advised them to send me away.  They returned chagrined. We were now confronted with an unexpected  situation. When, in , I came in close contact with Christian friends, I was a  mere novice. They tried hard to bring home to me, and make me  accept, the message of Jesus, and I was a humble and respectful  listener with an open mind. At that time I naturally studied  Hinduism to the best of my ability and endeavoured to understand  other religions.  In  the position was somewhat changed. Theosophist friends  certainly intended to draw me into their society, but that was with  a view to getting something from me as a Hindu. Theosophical  literature is replete with Hindu influence, and so these friends  expected that I should be helpful to them. I explained that my  Samskrit study was not much to speak of, that I had not read the  Hindu scriptures in the original, and that even my acquaintance with  the translations was of the slightest. But being believers in samskara  (tendencies caused by previous births) and punarjanma (rebirth),  they assumed that I should be able to render at least some help. And  so I felt like a Triton among the minnows. I started reading Swami Vivekananda's Rajayoga with some of these friends and M. N. Dvivedi's Rajayoga with others. I had to read Patanjali's Yoga  Sutras with one friend and the Bhagavad Gita with quite a number.  We formed a sort of Seekers' Club where we had regular readings. I  already had faith in the Gita, which had a fascination for me. Now I  realized the necessity of diving deeper into it. I had one or two  translations, by means of which I tried to understand the original  Samskrit. I decided also to get by heart one or two verses every  day. For this purpose I employed the time of my morning ablutions.  The operation took me thirty-five minutes, fifteen minutes for the  tooth brush and twenty for the bath. The first I used to do standing  in western fashion. So on the wall opposite I stuck slips of paper  on which were written the Gita verses and referred to them now and  then to help my memory. This time was found sufficient for  memorising the daily portion and recalling the verses already  learnt. I remember having thus committed to memory thirteen  chapters. But the memorising of the Gita had to give way to other  work and the creation and nurture of Satyagraha, which absorbed all  my thinking time, as the latter may be said to be doing even now.  What effect this reading of the Gita had on my friends only they can  say, but to me the Gita became an infallible guide of  conduct. It became my dictionary of daily reference. Just as I  turned to the English dictionary for the meanings of English words  that I did not understand, I turned to this dictionary of conduct  for a ready solution of all my troubles and trials. Words like aparigraha  (non-possession) and samabhava (equability) gripped me. How to  cultivate and preserve that equability was the question. How was one  to treat alike insulting, insolent and corrupt officials, co-workers  of yesterday raising meaningless opposition, and men who had always  been good to one? How was one to divest oneself of all possessions?  Was not the body itself possession enough? Were not wife and  children possessions? Was I to destroy all the cupboards of books I  had? Was I to give up all I had and follow Him? Straight came the  answer: I could not follow Him unless I gave up all I had. My study  of English law came to my help. Snell's discussion of the maxims of  Equity came to my memory. I understood more clearly in the light of  the Gita teaching the implication of the word 'trustee'. My regard  for jurisprudence increased, I discovered in it religion. I  understood the Gita teaching of non-possession to mean that those  who desired salvation should act like the trustee who, though having  control over great possessions, regards not an iota of them as his  own. It became clear to me as daylight that non-possession and  equability presupposed a change of heart, a change of attitude. I  then wrote to Revashankarbhai to allow the insurance policy to lapse  and get whatever could be recovered, or else to regard the premiums  already paid as lost, for I had become convinced that God, who  created my wife and children as well as myself, would take care of  them. To my brother, who had been as father to me, I wrote  explaining that I had given him all that I had saved up to that  moment, but that henceforth he should expect nothing from me, for  future savings, if any, would be utilized for the benefit of the  community.  I could not easily make my brother understand this. In  stern language he explained to me my duty towards him. I should not,  he said, aspire to be wiser than our father. I must support the  family as he did. I pointed out to him that I was doing exactly what  our father had done. The meaning of 'family' had but to be slightly  widened and the wisdom of my step would become clear.  My brother gave me up and practically stopped all communication. I  was deeply distressed, but it would have been a greater distress to  give up what I considered to be my duty, and I preferred the lesser.  But that did not affect my devotion to him, which remained as pure  and great as ever. His great love for me was at the root of his  misery. He did not so much want my money as that I should be well-behaved towards the family. Near the end of his life, however, he appreciated my view-point. When almost on his death-bed, he realized  that my step had been right and wrote me a most pathetic letter. He  apologized to me, if indeed a father may apologize to his son. He  commended his sons to my care, to be brought up as I thought fit,  and expressed his impatience to meet me. He cabled that he would  like to come to South Africa and I cabled in reply that he could.  But that was not to be. Nor could his desire as regards his sons be  fulfilled. He died before he could start for South Africa. His sons  had been brought up in the old atmosphere and could not change their  course of life. I could not draw them to me. It was not their fault.  'Who can say thus far, no further, to the tide of his own nature?'  Who can erase the impressions with which he is born? It is idle to  expect one's children and wards necessarily to follow the same  course of evolution as oneself.  This instance to some extent serves to show what a terrible  responsibility it is to be a parent. Before I narrate the struggle for the Indian settlers rights in the  Transvaal and their dealing with the Asiatic Department, I must turn  to some other aspects of my life.  Up to now there had been in me a mixed desire. The spirit of self-sacrifice was tempered by the desire to lay by something for the future.  About the time I took up chambers in Bombay, an American insurance  agent had come there \u2013 a man with a pleasing countenance and a sweet  tongue. As though we were old friends he discussed my future  welfare. 'All men of your status in America have their lives  insured. Should you not also insure yourself against the future?  Life is uncertain. We in America regard it as a religious obligation  to get insured. Can I not tempt you to take out a small policy?' Up to this time I had given the cold shoulder to all the agents I  had met in South Africa and India, for I had though that life  assurance implied fear and want of faith in God. But now I succumbed  to the temptation of the American agent. As he proceeded with his  argument, I had before my mind's eye a picture of my wife and  children. 'Man, you have sold almost all the ornaments of your  wife,' I said to myself. 'If something were to happen to you, the  burden of supporting her and the children would fall on your poor  brother, who has so nobly filled the place of father. How would that  become you?' With these and similar arguments I persuaded myself to  take out a policy for Rs. ,. But when my mode of life changed in South Africa, my outlook changed  too. All the steps I took at this time of trial were taken in the  name of God and for His service. I did not know how long I should  have to stay in South Africa. I had a fear that I might never be  able to get back to India: so I decided to keep my wife and children  with me and earn enough to support them. This plan made me deplore  the life policy and feel ashamed of having been caught in the net of  the insurance agent. If, I said to myself, my brother is really in  the position of my father, surely he would not consider it too much  of a burden to support my widow, if it came to that. And what reason  had I to assume that death would claim me earlier than the others?  After all the real protector was neither I nor my brother, but the  Almighty. In getting my life insured I had robbed my wife and  children of their self-reliance. Why should they not be expected to  take care of themselves? What happened to the families of the  numberless poor in the world? Why should I not count myself as one  of them?  A multitude of such thoughts passed though my mind, but I did not  immediately act upon them. I recollect having paid at least one  insurance premium in South Africa.  Outward circumstances too  supported this train of thought. During my first sojourn in South  Africa it was Christian influence that had kept alive in me the  religious sense. Now it was theosophical influence that added  strength to it. Mr. Ritch was a theosophist and put me in touch with  the society at Johannesburg. I never became a member, as I had my  differences, but I came in close contact with almost every  theosophist. I had religious discussions with them every day. There  used to be readings from theosophical books, and sometimes I had  occasion to address their meetings. The chief thing about theosophy  is to cultivate and promote the idea of brotherhood. We had  considerable discussion over this, and I criticized the members  where their conduct did not appear to me to square with their ideal.  The criticism was not without its wholesome effect on me. It led to  introspection. With the growing simplicity of my life, my dislike for medicines steadily  increased. While practising in Durban, I suffered for some time from  debility and rheumatic inflammation. Dr. P. J. Mehta, who had come  to see me, gave me treatment, and I got well. After that, up to the  time when I returned to India, I do not remember having suffered  from any ailment to speak of.  But I used to be troubled with constipation and frequent headaches,  while at Johannesburg. I kept myself fit with occasional laxatives  and a well-regulated diet. But I could hardly call myself healthy,  and always wondered when I should get free from the incubus of these  laxative medicines.  About this time I read of the formation of a 'No Breakfast  Association' in Manchester. The argument of the promoters was that  Englishmen ate too often and too much, that their doctors' bills  were heavy because they ate until midnight, and that they should at  least give up breakfast, if they wanted to improve this state of  affairs. Though all these things could not be said of me, I felt  that the argument did partly apply in my case. I used to have three  square meals daily in addition to afternoon tea. I was never a spare  eater and enjoyed as many delicacies as could be had with a  vegetarian and spiceless diet. I scarcely ever got up before six or  seven. I therefore argued that, if I also dropped the morning  breakfast, I might become free from headaches. So I tried the  experiment. For a few days it was rather hard, but the headaches  entirely disappeared. This led me to conclude that I was eating more  than I needed.  But the change was far from relieving me of constipation. I tried  Kuhne's hipbaths, which gave some relief but did not completely cure  me. In the meantime the German who had a vegetarian restaurant, or  some other friend, I forget who, placed in my hands Just's  Return of Nature.  In this book I read about earth treatment. The author also advocated  fresh fruit and nuts as the natural diet of man. I did not at once  take to the exclusive fruit diet, but immediately began experiments  in earth treatment, and with wonderful results. The treatment  consisted in applying to the abdomen a bandage of clean earth  moistened with cold water and spread like a poultice on fine linen.  This I applied at bed time, removing it during the night or in the  morning, whenever I happened to wake up. It proved a radical cure.  Since then I have tried the treatment on myself and my friends and  never had reason to regret it. In India I have not been able to try  this treatment with equal confidence. For one thing, I have never  had time to settle down in one place to conduct the experiments. But  my faith in the earth and water treatment remains practically the  same as before. Even today I give myself the earth treatment to a  certain extent and recommend it to my co-workers, whenever the occasion  arises.  Though I have had two serious illnesses in my life, I believe that  man has little need to drug himself. Nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a thousand can  be brought round by means of a well-regulated diet, water and earth  treatment and similar household remedies. He who runs to the doctor, vaidya or hakim for every little aliment, and swallows all kinds of vegetable and  mineral drugs, not only curtails his life, but, by becoming the  slave of his body instead of remaining its master, loses  self-control, and ceases to be a man.  Let no one discount these observations because they are being  written in a sickbed. I know the reasons for my illnesses. I am  fully conscious that I alone am responsible for them, and it is  because of that consciousness that I have not lost patience. In fact  I have thanked God for them as lessons and successfully resisted the  temptation of taking numerous drugs. I know my obstinacy often tries  my doctors, but they kindly bear with me and do not give me up.  However, I must not digress. Before proceeding further, I should  give the reader a word of warning. Those who purchase Just's book on  the strength of this chapter should not take everything in it to be  gospel truth. A writer almost always presents one aspect of a case,  whereas every case can be seen from no less than seven points of  view, all of which are probably correct by themselves, but not  correct at the same time and in the same circumstances. And then  many books are written with a view to gaining customers and earning  name and fame. Let those, therefore, who read such books as these do  so with discernment, and take advice of some experienced man before  trying any of the experiments set forth, or let them  read the books with patience and digest them thoroughly before  acting upon them. As the ideals of sacrifice and simplicity were becoming more and more  realized, and the religious consciousness was becoming more and more  quickened in my daily life, the passion for vegetarianism as a  mission went on increasing. I have known only one way of carrying on  missionary work, viz., by personal example and discussion with searchers for  knowledge.  There was in Johannesburg a vegetarian restaurant conducted by a  German who believed in Kuhne's hydropathic treatment. I visited the  restaurant myself and helped it by taking English friends there. But  I saw that it could not last as it was always in financial  difficulties. I assisted it as much as I thought it deserved, and  spent some money on it, but it had ultimately to be closed down.  Most theosophists are vegetarians more or less, and an enterprising  lady belonging to that society now came upon the scene with a  vegetarian restaurant on a grand scale. She was fond of art,  extravagant and ignorant of accounts. Her circle of friends was  fairly large. She had started in a small way, but later decided to  extend the venture by taking large rooms, and asked me for help. I  knew nothing of her finances when she thus approached me, but I took  it that her estimate must be fairly accurate. And I was in a  position to accommodate her. My clients used to keep large sums as  deposits with me. Having received the consent of one of these  clients, I lent about a thousand pounds from the amount to his  credit. This client was most large-hearted and trusting. He had  originally come to South Africa as an indentured labourer. He said:  'Give away the money, if you like. I know nothing in these matters.  I only know you.' His name was Badri. He afterwards took a prominent  part in Satyagraha, and suffered imprisonment as well. So I advanced  the loan assuming that this consent was enough. In two or three months' time I came to know that the amount would  not be recovered. I could ill afford to sustain such a loss. There  were many other purposes to which I could have applied this amount.  The loan was never repaid. But how could trusting Badri be allowed  to suffer? He had known me only. I made good the loss.  A client friend to whom I spoke about this transaction sweetly chided  me for my folly.  'Bhai,' - I had fortunately not yet become 'Mahatma', nor even 'Bapu'  (father); friends used to call me by the loving name of 'Bhai'  (brother) - said he, 'this was not for you to do. We depend upon you  in so many things. You are not going to get back this amount. I know  you will never allow Badri to come to grief, for you will pay him  out of your pocket, but if you go on helping your reform schemes by  operating on your clients' money, the poor fellows will be ruined,  and you will soon become a beggar. But you are our trustee and must  know that, if you become a beggar, all our public work will come to  a stop.'  The friend, I am thankful to say, is still alive. I have not yet come  across a purer man than he, in South Africa or anywhere else. I have  known him to apologize to people and to cleanse himself, when,  having happened to suspect them, he had found his suspicion to be  unfounded.  I saw that he had rightly warned me. For though I made good Badri's  loss, I should not have been able to meet any similar loss and  should have been driven to incur debt - a thing I have never done in  my life and always abhorred. I realized that even a man's reforming  zeal ought not to make him exceed his limits. I also saw that in  thus lending trust-money I had disobeyed the cardinal teaching of  the Gita, viz., the duty of a man of equipoise to act without  desire for the fruit. The error became for me a beacon-light of  warning.  The sacrifice offered on the altar of vegetarianism was neither  intentional nor expected. It was a virtue of necessity.",
    "1908-1912": " Just about the time when I gave up milk and cereals, and started on the  experiment of a fruit diet, I began fasting as a means of  self-restraint. In this Mr. Kallenbach also joined me. I had been  used to fasting now and again, but for purely health reasons. That  fasting was necessary for self-restraint I learnt from a friend.  Having been born in a Vaishnava family and of a mother who was given  to keeping all sorts of hard vows, I had observed, while in India,  the Ekadashi and other fasts, but in doing so I had merely copied my mother and  sought to please my parents.  At that time I did not understand, nor  did I believe in, the efficacy of fasting. But seeing that the  friend I have mentioned was observing it with benefit, and with the  hope of supporting the brahmacharya vow, I followed his example and began keeping the  Ekadashi fast. As a rule Hindus allow themselves milk and fruit on a fasting  day, but such fast I had been keeping daily. So now I began complete  fasting, allowing myself only water.  When I started on this experiment, the Hindu month of Shravan and  the Islamic month of Ramzan happened to coincide. The Gandhis used  to observe not only the Vaishnava but also the Shaivite vows, and  visited the Shaivite as also the Vaishnava temples. Some of the  members of the family used to observe pradosha  in the whole of the month of Shravan. I decided to do likewise. These important experiments were undertaken while we were at Tolstoy  Farm, where Mr. Kallenbach and I were staying with a few Satyagrahi  families, including young people and children. For these last we had  a school. Among them were four or five Musalmans. I always helped  and encouraged them in keeping all their religious observances. I  took care to see that they offered their daily namaz.  There were Christians and Parsi youngsters too, whom I considered it  my duty to encourage to follow their respective religious  observances.  During this month, therefore, I persuaded the Musalman youngsters to  observe the ramzan fast. I had of course decided to observe  pradosha myself, but I now asked the Hindu, Parsi and Christian youngsters to  join me. I explained to them that it was always a good thing to join  with others in any matter of self-denial. Many of the Farm inmates  welcomed my proposal. The Hindu and the Parsi youngsters did not  copy the Musalman ones in every detail; it was not necessary.  The Musalman youngsters had to wait for their breakfast until sunset,  whereas the others did not do so, and were thus able to prepare  delicacies for the Musalman friends and serve them. Nor had the  Hindu and other youngsters to keep the Musalmans company when they  had their last meal before sunrise next morning, and of course all  except the Musalmans allowed themselves water.  The result of these experiments was that all were convinced of the  value of fasting, and a splendid esprit de corps  grew up among them.  We were all vegetarians on Tolstoy Farm, thanks, I must gratefully  confess, to the readiness of all to respect my feelings. The  Musalman youngsters must have missed their meat during ramzan,  but none of them ever let me know that they did so. They delighted  in and relished the vegetarian diet, and the Hindu youngsters often  prepared vegetarian delicacies for them, in keeping with the  simplicity of the Farm.  I have purposely digressed in the midst of this chapter on fasting,  as I could not have given these pleasant reminiscences anywhere  else, and I have indirectly described a characteristic of mine,  namely that I have always loved to have my co-workers with me in  anything that has appealed to me as being good. They were quite new  to fasting, but thanks to the pradosha and ramzan  fasts, it was easy for me to interest them in fasting as a means of  self-restraint.  Thus an atmosphere of self-restraint naturally sprang up on the  Farm. All the Farm inmates now began to join us in keeping partial  and complete fasts, which, I am sure, was entirely to the good. I  cannot definitely say how far this self-denial touched their hearts  and helped them in their striving to conquer the flesh. For my part,  however, I am convinced that I greatly benefited by it both  physically and morally. But I know that it does not necessarily  follow that fasting and similar disciplines would have the same  effect for all.  Fasting can help to curb animal passion, only if it is undertaken  with a view to self-restraint. Some of my friends have actually  found their animal passion and palate stimulated as an after-effect  of fasts. That is to say, fasting is futile unless it is accompanied  by an incessant longing for self-restraint. The famous verse from  the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita  is worth noting in this connection:  I have described in the last chapter how Kasturbai's illness was  instrumental in bringing about some changes in my diet. At a later  stage more changes were introduced for the sake of supporting brahmacharya. The first of these was the giving up of milk. It was from  Raychandbhai that I first learnt that milk stimulated animal  passion. Books on vegetarianism strengthened the idea, but so long  as I had not taken the brahmacharya vow I could not make up my mind to forego milk. I had long realized  that milk was not necessary for supporting the body, but it was not  easy to give it up. While the necessity for avoiding milk in the  interests of self-restraint was growing upon me, I happened to come  across some literature from Calcutta, describing the tortures to  which cows and buffaloes were subjected by their keepers. This had a  wonderful effect on me. I discussed it with Mr. Kallenbach. Though I have introduced Mr. Kallenbach to the readers of the  history of Satyagraha in South Africa, and referred to him in a  previous chapter, I think it necessary to say something more about  him here. We met quite by accident. He was a friend of Mr. Khan's,  and as the latter had discovered deep down in him a vein of  other-worldliness he introduced him to me.  When I came to know him I was startled at his love of luxury and extravagance. But at our very  first meeting, he asked searching questions concerning matters of  religion. We incidentally talked of Gautama Buddha's renunciation.  Our acquaintance soon ripened into very close friendship, so much so  that we thought alike, and he was convinced that he must carry out  in his life the changes I was making in mine.  At that time he was single, and was expending Rs. , monthly on  himself, over and above house rent. Now he reduced himself to such  simplicity that his expenses came to Rs.  per month. After the  breaking up of my household and my first release from jail, we began  to live together. It was a fairly hard life that we led.  It was during this time that we had the discussion about milk. Mr.  Kallenbach said, 'We constantly talk about the harmful effects of  milk. Why then do not we give it up? It is certainly not necessary.'  I was agreeably surprised at the suggestion, which I warmly  welcomed, and both of us pledged ourselves to abjure milk there and  then. This was at Tolstoy Farm in the year .  But this denial was not enough to satisfy me. Soon after this I  decided to live on a pure fruit diet, and that too composed of the  cheapest fruit possible. Our ambition was to live the life of the  poorest people.  The fruit diet turned out to be very convenient also. Cooking was  practically done away with. Raw groundnuts, bananas, dates, lemons,  and olive oil composed our usual diet.  I must here utter a warning for the aspirants of brahmacharya.  Though I have made out an intimate connection between diet and brahmacharya,  it is certain that mind is the principal thing. A mind consciously  unclean cannot be cleansed by fasting. Modifications in diet have no  effect on it. The concupiscence of the mind cannot be rooted out  except by intense self-examination, surrender to God and, lastly,  grace. But there is an intimate connection between the mind and the  body, and carnal mind always lusts for delicacies and luxuries. To  obviate this tendency dietetic restrictions and fasting would appear  to be necessary. The carnal mind, instead of controlling the senses,  becomes their slave, and therefore the body always needs clean  non-stimulating foods and periodical fasting.  Those who make light of dietetic restrictions and fasting are as  much in error as those who stake their all on them. My experience  teaches me that, for those whose minds are working towards  self-restraint, dietetic restriction and fasting are very helpful.  In fact without their help concupiscence cannot be completely rooted  out the mind.   The reader will, I hope, bear in mind the fact that I am, in these  chapters, describing things not mentioned, or only cursorily  mentioned, in the history of Satyagraha in South Africa. If he does  so, he will easily see the connection between the recent chapters.  As the Farm grew, it was found necessary to make some provision for  the education of its boys and girls. There were, among these, Hindu,  Musalman, Parsi and Christian boys and some Hindu girls. It was not  possible, and I did not think it necessary, to engage special  teachers for them. It was not possible, for qualified Indian  teachers were scarce, and even when available, none would be ready  to go to a place twenty-one miles distant from Johannesburg on a small  salary. Also we were certainly not overflowing with money. And I did  not think it necessary to import teachers from outside the Farm. I  did not believe in the existing system of education, and I had a  mind to find out by experience and experiment the true system. Only  this much I knew \u2013 that, under ideal conditions, true education could  be imparted only by the parents, and that then there should be the  minimum of outside help, that Tolstoy Farm was a family, in which I  occupied the place of the father, and that I should so far as  possible shoulder the responsibility for the training of the young. The conception no doubt was not without its flaws. All the young  people had not been with me since their childhood, they had been  brought up in different conditions and environments, and they did  not belong to the same religion. How could I do full justice to the  young people, thus circumstanced, even if I assumed the place of  paterfamilias?  But I had always given the first place to the culture of the heart  or the building of character, and as I felt confident that moral  training could be given to all alike, no matter how different their  ages and their upbringing, I decided to live amongst them all the  twenty-four hours of the day as their father. I regarded character  building as the proper foundation for their education and, if the  foundation was firmly laid, I was sure that the children could learn  all the other things themselves or with the assistance of friends.  But as I fully appreciated the necessity of a literary training in  addition, I started some classes with the help of Mr. Kallenbach and  Sjt. Pragji Desai. Nor did I underrate the building up of the body.  This they got in the course of their daily routine. For there were  no servants on the Farm, and all the work, from cooking down to  scavenging, was done by the inmates. There were many fruit trees to  be looked after, and enough gardening to be done as well. Mr.  Kallenbach was fond of gardening and had gained some experience of  this work in one of the Governmental model gardens. It was  obligatory on all, young and old, who were not engaged in the  kitchen, to give some time to gardening. The children had the lion's  share of this work, which included digging pits, felling timber and  lifting loads. This gave them ample exercise. They took delight in  the work, and so they did not generally need any other exercise or  games. Of course some of them, and sometimes all them, malingered  and shirked. Sometimes I connived at their pranks, but often I was  strict with them. I dare say they did not like the strictness, but I  do not recollect their having resisted it. Whenever I was strict, I  would, by argument, convince them that it was not right to play with  one's work. The conviction, would however, be short-lived, the next  moment they would again leave their work and go to play. All the  same we got along, and at any rate they built up fine physiques.  There was scarcely any illness on the Farm, though it must be said  that good air and water and regular hours of food were not a little  responsible for this.  A word about vocational training. It was my intention to teach every  one of the youngsters some useful manual vocation. For this purpose  Mr. Kallenbach went to a Trappist monastery and returned having  learnt shoe-making. I learnt it from him and taught the art to such  as were ready to take it up. Mr. Kallenbach had some experience of  carpentry, and there was another inmate who knew it; so we had a  small class in carpentry. Cooking almost all the youngsters knew. All this was new to them. They had never even dreamt that they would  have to learn these things some day. For generally the only training  that Indian children received in South Africa was in the three R's. On Tolstoy Farm we made it a rule that the youngsters should not be  asked to do what the teachers did not do, and therefore, when they  were asked to do any work, there was always a teacher co-operating  and actually working with them. Hence whatever the youngsters  learnt, they learnt cheerfully.  Literary training and character building must be dealt with in the  following chapters.  It was at Tolstoy Farm that Mr. Kallenbach drew my attention to a  problem that had never before struck me. As I have already said,  some of the boys at the Farm were bad and unruly. There were  loafers, too, amongst them. With these my three boys came in daily  contact, as also did other children of the same type as my own sons.  This troubled Mr. Kallenbach, but his attention was centred on the  impropriety of keeping my boys with these unruly youngsters. One day he spoke out: 'Your way of mixing your own boys with the bad  ones does not appeal to me. It can have only one result. They will  become demoralized through this bad company.' I do not remember whether the question puzzled me at the moment, but  I recollect what I said to him: 'How can I distinguish between my boys and the loafers? I am equally  responsible for both. The youngsters have come because I invited  them. If I were to dismiss them with some money, they would  immediately run off to Johannesburg and fall back into their old  ways. To tell you the truth, it is quite likely that they and their  guardians believe that, by having come here, they have laid me under  an obligation. That they have to put up with a good deal of  inconvenience here, you and I know very well. But my duty is clear.  I must have them here, and therefore my boys also must needs live  with them. And surely you do not want me to teach my boys to feel  from today that they are superior to other boys. To put that sense  of superiority into their heads would be to lead them astray. This  association with other boys will be a good discipline for them. They  will, of their own accord, learn to discriminate between good and  evil. Why should we not believe that, if there is really anything  good in them, it is bound to react on their companions? However that  may be, I cannot help keeping them here, and if that means some  risk, we must run it.' Mr. Kallenbach shook his head. The result, I think, cannot be said to have been bad. I do not  consider my sons were any the worse for the experiment. On the  contrary I can see that they gained something. If there was the  slightest trace of superiority in them, it was destroyed and they  learnt to mix with all kinds of children. They were tested and  disciplined. This and similar experiments have shown me that, if good children  are taught together with bad ones and thrown into their company,  they will lose nothing, provided the experiment is conducted under  the watchful care of their parents and guardians. Children wrapped up in cotton wool are not always proof against all  temptation or contamination. It is true, however, that when boys and  girls of all kinds of upbringing are kept and taught together, the  parents and the teachers are put to the severest test. They have  constantly to be on the alert.  The spiritual training of the boys was a much more difficult matter than  their physical and mental training. I relied little on religious  books for the training of the spirit. Of course I believed that  every student should be acquainted with the elements of his own  religion and have a general knowledge of his own scriptures, and  therefore I provided for such knowledge as best I could. But that,  to my mind, was part of the intellectual training. Long before I  undertook the education of the youngsters of the Tolstoy Farm I had  realized that the training of the spirit was a thing by itself. To  develop the spirit is to build character and to enable one to work  towards a knowledge of God and self-realization. And I held that  this was an essential part of the training of the young, and that  all training without culture of the spirit was of no use, and might  be even harmful.  I am familiar with the superstition that self-realization is  possible only in the fourth stage of life, i.e., sannyasa  (renunciation). But it is a matter of common knowledge that those  who defer preparation for this invaluable experience until the last  stage of life attain not self-realization but old age amounting to a  second and pitiable childhood, living as a burden on this earth. I  have a full recollection that I held these views even whilst I was  teaching i.e., in -, though I might not then have expressed  them in identical language.  How then was this spiritual training to be given? I made the  children memorize and recite hymns, and read to them from books on  moral training. But that was far from satisfying me. As I came into  closer contact with them I saw that it was not through books that  one could impart training of the spirit. Just as physical training  was to be imparted through physical exercise, and intellectual  through intellectual exercise, even so the training of  the spirit was possible only through the exercise of the spirit. And  the exercise of the spirit entirely depended on the life and  character of the teacher. The teacher had always to be mindful of  his p's and q's, whether he was in the midst of his boys or not. It is possible for a teacher situated miles away to affect the  spirit of the pupils by his way of living. It would be idle for me,  if I were a liar, to teach boys to tell the truth. A cowardly  teacher would never succeed in making his boys valiant, and a  stranger to self-restraint could never teach his pupils the value of self-restraint.  I saw, therefore, that I must be an eternal  object-lesson to the boys and girls living with me. They thus became  my teachers, and I learnt I must be good and live straight, if only  for their sakes. I may say that the increasing discipline and  restraint I imposed on myself at Tolstoy Farm was mostly due to  those wards of mine.  One of them was wild, unruly, given to lying, and quarrelsome. On  one occasion he broke out most violently. I was exasperated. I never  punished my boys, but this time I was very angry. I tried to reason  with him. But he was adamant and even tried to overreach me. At last  I picked up a ruler lying at hand and delivered a blow on his arm. I  trembled as I struck him. I dare say he noticed it. This was an  entirely novel experience for them all. The boy cried out and begged  to be forgiven. He cried not because the beating was painful to him;  he could, if he had been so minded, have paid me back in the same  coin, being a stoutly built youth of seventeen; but he realized my  pain in being driven to this violent resource. Never again after  this incident did he disobey me. But I still repent that violence. I  am afraid I exhibited before him that day not the spirit, but the  brute, in me.  I have always been opposed to corporal punishment. I remember only  one occasion on which I physically punished one of my sons. I have  therefore never until this day been able to decide whether I was  right or wrong in using the ruler. Probably it was improper, for it  was prompted by anger and a desire to punish. Had it been an  expression only of my distress, I should have considered it  justified. But the motive in this case was mixed.  This incident set me thinking and taught me a better method of  correcting students. I do not know whether that method would have  availed on the occasion in question. The youngster soon forgot the  incident, and I do not think he ever showed great improvement. But  the incident made me understand better the duty of a teacher towards  his pupils.  Cases of misconduct on the part of the boys often occurred after  this, but I never resorted to corporal punishment. Thus in my  endeavour to impart spiritual training to the boys and girls under  me, I came to understand better and better the power of the spirit.  It was seen in the last chapter how we provided for the physical  training on Tolstoy Farm, and incidentally for the vocational.  Though this was hardly done in a way to satisfy me, it may be  claimed to have been more or less successful.  Literary training, however, was a more difficult matter. I had  neither the resources nor the literary equipment necessary; and I  had not the time I would have wished to devote to the subject. The  physical work that I was doing used to leave me thoroughly exhausted  at the end of the day, and I used to have the classes just when I  was most in need of some rest. Instead, therefore, of my being fresh  for the class, I could with the greatest difficulty keep myself  awake. The mornings had to be devoted to work on the farm and  domestic duties, so the school hours had to be kept after the midday  meal. There was no other time suitable for the school. We gave three periods at the most to literary training. Hindi,  Tamil, Gujarati and Urdu were all taught, and tuition was given  through the vernaculars of the boys. English was taught as well. It  was also necessary to acquaint the Gujarati Hindu children with a  little Samskrit, and to teach all the children elementary history,  geography and arithmetic.  I had undertaken to teach Tamil and Urdu.  The little Tamil I knew was acquired during voyages and in jail. I  had not got beyond Pope's excellent Tamil handbook. My knowledge of  the Urdu script was all that I had acquired on a single voyage, and  my knowledge of the language was confined to the familiar Persian  and Arabic words that I had learnt from contact with Musalman  friends. Of Samskrit I knew no more than I had learnt at the high  school, even my Gujarati was no better than that which one acquires  at the school.  Such was the capital with which I had to carry on. In poverty of  literary equipment my colleagues went one better than I. But my love  for the languages of my country, my confidence in my capacity as a  teacher, as also the ignorance of my pupils, and  more than that, their generosity, stood me in good stead.  The Tamil boys were all born in South Africa, and therefore knew  very little Tamil, and did not know the script at all. So I had to  teach them the script and the rudiments of grammar. That was easy  enough. My pupils knew that they could any day beat me in Tamil  conversation, and when Tamilians, not knowing English, came to see  me, they became my interpreters. I got along merrily, because I  never attempted to disguise my ignorance from my pupils. In all  respects I showed myself to them exactly as I really was. Therefore  in spite of my colossal ignorance of the language I never lost their  love and respect. It was comparatively easier to teach the Musalman  boys Urdu. They knew the script. I had simply to stimulate in them  an interest in reading and to improve their handwriting. These youngsters were for the most part unlettered and unschooled.  But I found in the course of my work that I had very little to teach  them, beyond weaning them from their laziness, and supervising their  studies. As I was content with this, I could pull on with boys of  different ages and learning different subjects in one and the same  class room.  Of text-books, about which we hear so much, I never felt the want. I  do not even remember having made much use of the books that were  available. I did not find it at all necessary to load the boys with  quantities of books. I have always felt that the true text-book for  the pupil is his teacher. I remember very little that my teachers  taught me from books, but I have even now a clear recollection of  the things they taught me independently of books.  Children take in much more and with less labour through their ears  than through their eyes. I do not remember having read any book from  cover to cover with my boys. But I gave them, in my own language,  all that I had digested from my reading of various books, and I dare  say they are still carrying a recollection of it in their minds. It  was laborious for them to remember what they learnt from books, but  what I imparted to them by word of mouth, they could repeat with the  greatest ease. Reading was a task for them, but listening to me was  a pleasure, when I did not bore them by failure to make my subject  interesting. And from the questions that my talks prompted them to  put, I had a measure of their power of understanding. ",
    "1913-1917": " Whilst I was yet winding up my work on the Committee, I received a letter  from Sjts. Mohanlal Pandya and Shankarlal Parikh telling me of the  failure of crops in the Kheda district, and asking me to guide the  peasants, who were unable to pay the assessment. I had not the  inclination, the ability or the courage to advise without an inquiry  on the spot.  At the same time there came a letter from Shrimati Anasuyabai about  the condition of labour in Ahmedabad. Wages were low, the labourers  had long been agitating for an increment, and I had a desire to  guide them if I could. But I had not the confidence to direct even  this comparatively small affair from that long distance. So I seized  the first opportunity to go to Ahmedabad. I had hoped that I should  be able to finish both these matters quickly and get back to  Champaran to supervise the constructive work that had been  inaugurated there.  But things did not move as swiftly as I had wished, and I was unable  to return to Champaran, with the result that the schools closed down  one by one. My co-workers and I had built many castles in the air,  but they all vanished for the time being.  One of these was cow protection work in Champaran, besides rural  sanitation and education. I had seen, in the course of my travels,  that cow protection and Hindi propaganda had become the exclusive  concern of the Marwadis. A Marwadi friend had sheltered me in his dharmashala  whilst at Bettiah. Other Marwadis of the place had interested me in  their goshala (dairy). My ideas about cow protection had been  definitely formed then, and my conception of the work was the same  as it is today. Cow protection, in my opinion, included  cattle-breeding, improvement of the stock, humane treatment of  bullocks, formation of model dairies, etc. The Marwadi friends had  promised full co-operation in this work, but as I could not fix  myself up in Champaran, the scheme could not be carried out. The goshala in Bettiah is still there, but it has not become a  model dairy, the Champaran bullock is still made to work beyond his  capacity, and the so-called Hindu still cruelly belabours the poor  animal and disgraces his religion.  That this work should have remained unrealized has been, to me, a  continual regret, and whenever I go to Champaran and hear the gentle  reproaches of the Marwadi and Bihari friends, I recall with a heavy  sigh all those plans which I had to drop so abruptly.  The educational work in one way or another is going on in many  places. But the cow protection work had not taken firm root, and has  not, therefore, progressed in the direction intended.  Whilst the Kheda peasants' question was still being discussed, I had already  taken up the question of the mill-hands in Ahmedabad.  I was in a most delicate situation. The mill-hands' case was strong.  Shrimati Anasuyabai had to battle against her own brother, Sjt.  Ambalal Sarabhai, who led the fray on behalf of the mill-owners. My  relations with them were friendly, and that made fighting with them  the more difficult. I held consultations with them, and requested  them to refer the dispute to arbitration, but they refused to  recognize the principle of arbitration. I had therefore to advise the labourers to go on strike. Before I  did so, I came in very close contact with them and their leaders,  and explained to them the conditions of a successful strike:  Before I proceed to describe the progress of the labour dispute it is  essential to have a peep into the Ashram. All the while I was in  Champaran the Ashram was never out of my mind, and occasionally I  paid it flying visits.  At that time the Ashram was in Kochrab, a small village near  Ahmedabad. Plague broke out in this village, and I saw evident  danger to the safety of the Ashram children. It was impossible to  keep ourselves immune from the effects of the surrounding  insanitation, however scrupulously we might observe the rules of  cleanliness within the Ashram walls. We were not then equal either  to getting the Kochrab people to observe these rules nor to serving  the village otherwise.  Our ideal was to have the Ashram at a safe distance both from town  and village, and yet at a manageable distance from either. And we  were determined, some day, to settle on ground of our own. The plague, I felt, was sufficient notice to quit Kochrab. Sjt.  Punjabhai Hirachand, a merchant in Ahmedabad, had come in close  contact with the Ashram, and used to serve us in a number of matters  in a pure and selfless spirit. He had a wide experience of things in  Ahmedabad, and he volunteered to procure us suitable land. I went  about with him north and south of Kochrab in search of land, and  then suggested to him to find out a piece of land three or four  miles to the north. He hit upon the present site. Its vicinity to  the Sabarmati Central Jail was for me a special attraction. As  jail-going was understood to be the normal lot of Satyagrahis, I  liked this position. And I knew that the sites selected for jails  have generally clean surroundings.  In about eight days the sale was executed. There was no building on  the land and no tree. But its situation on the bank of the river and  its solitude were great advantages.  We decided to start by living under canvas, and having a tin shed  for a kitchen, till permanent houses were built.  The Ashram had been slowly growing. We were now over forty souls,  men, women and children, having our meals at a common kitchen. The  whole conception about the removal was mine, the execution was as  usual left to Maganlal.  Our difficulties, before we had permanent living accommodation, were  great. The rains were impending, and provisions had to be got from  the city four miles away. The ground, which had been a waste, was  infested with snakes, and it was no small risk to live with little  children under such conditions. The general rule was not to kill the  snakes, though I confess none of us had shed the fear of these  reptiles, nor have we even now.  The rule of not killing venomous reptiles had been practised for the  most part at Phoenix, Tolstoy Farm and Sabarmati. At each of these  places we had to settle on waste lands. We have had, however, no  loss of life occasioned by snakebite. I see, with the eye of faith,  in this circumstance the hand of the God of Mercy. Let no one cavil  at this, saying that God can never be partial, and that He has no  time to meddle with the humdrum affairs of men. I have no other  language to express the fact of the matter, to describe this uniform  experience of mine. Human language can but imperfectly describe  God's ways. I am sensible of the fact that they are indescribable  and inscrutable. But if mortal man will dare to describe them, he  has no better medium than his own inarticulate speech. Even if it be  a superstition to believe that complete immunity from harm for  twenty-five years in spite of a fairly regular practice of  non-killing is not a fortuitous accident but a grace of God, I  should still hug that superstition.  During the strike of the mill-hands in Ahmedabad the foundation of  the Ashram weaving shed was being laid. For the principal activity  of the Ashram was then weaving. Spinning had not so far been  possible for us.  As last, after no end of wandering in Gujarat, Gangabehn found the  spinning wheel in Vijapur in the Baroda State. Quite a number of  people there had spinning wheels in their homes, but had long since  consigned them to the lofts as useless lumber. They expressed to  Gangabehn their readiness to resume spinning, if someone promised to provide  them with a regular supply of slivers, and to buy the yarn spun by  them. Gangabehn communicated the joyful news to me. The providing of  slivers was found to be a difficult task. On my mentioning the  thing to the late Umar Sobani, he solved the difficulty by  immediately undertaking to send a sufficient supply of slivers from  his mill. I sent to Gangabehn the slivers received from Umar Sobani,  and soon yarn began to pour in at such a rate that it became quite a  problem how to cope with it.  Mr. Umar Sobani's generosity was great, but still one could not go  on taking advantage of it for ever. I felt ill at ease, continuously  receiving slivers from him. Moreover, it seemed to me to be  fundamentally wrong to use mill-slivers. If one could use mill-slivers,  why not use mill-yarn as well? Surely no mills supplied  slivers to the ancients? How did they make their slivers then?  With these thoughts in my mind I suggested to Gangabehn to find  carders who could supply slivers. She confidently undertook the  task. She engaged a carder who was prepared to card cotton. He  demanded thirty-five rupees, if not much more, per month. I  considered no price too high at the time. She trained a few  youngsters to make slivers out of the carded cotton. I begged for  cotton in Bombay. Sjt. Yashvantprasad Desai at once responded.  Gangabehn's enterprise thus prospered beyond expectations. She found  out weavers to weave the yarn that was spun in Vijapur, and soon  Vijapur khadi gained a name for itself.  While these developments were taking place in Vijapur, the spinning  wheel gained a rapid footing in the Ashram. Maganlal Gandhi, by  bringing to bear all his splendid mechanical talent on the wheel,  made many improvements in it, and wheels and their accessories began  to be manufactured at the Ashram. The first piece of khadi  manufactured in the Ashram cost  annas per yard. I did not  hesitate to commend this very coarse khadi at that rate to friends,  who willingly paid the price.  I was laid up in bed at Bombay. But I was fit enough to make  searches for the wheel there. At last I chanced upon two spinners.  They charged one rupee for a seer of yarn, i.e.,  tolas  or nearly three quarters of a pound. I was then ignorant of the  economics of khadi. I considered no price too high for securing  handspun yarn. On comparing the rates paid by me with those paid in  Vijapur I found that I was being cheated. The spinners refused to  agree to any reduction in their rates. So I had to dispense with  their service. But they served their purpose. They taught spinning  to Shrimatis Avantikabai, Ramibai Kamdar, the widowed mother of Sjt.  Shankarlal Banker and Shrimati Vasumatibehn. The wheel began merrily  to hum in my room, and I may say without exaggeration that its hum  had no small share in restoring me to health. I am prepared to  admit that its effect was more psychological than physical. But then  it only shows how powerfully the physical in man reacts to the  psychological. I too set my hand to the wheel, but did not do much  with it at the time.  In Bombay, again, the same old problem of obtaining a supply of  hand-made slivers presented itself. A carder twanging his bow used  to pass daily by Sjt. Revashankar's residence. I sent for him and  learnt that he carded cotton for stuffing mattresses. He  agreed to card cotton for slivers, but demanded a stiff price for it,  which, however, I paid. The yarn thus prepared I disposed of to some  Vaishnava friends for making from it the garlands for the pavitra ekadashi.  Sjt. Shivji started a spinning class in Bombay. All these  experiments involved considerable expenditure. But it was willingly  defrayed by patriotic friends, lovers of the motherland, who had  faith in khadi. The money thus spent, in my humble opinion, was not  wasted . It brought us a rich store of experience, and revealed to  us the possibilities of the spinning wheel.  I now grew impatient for the exclusive adoption of khadi for  my dress. My dhoti was still of Indian mill cloth. The coarse khadi manufactured in the  Ashram and at Vijapur was only thirty inches in width. I gave notice to Gangabehn that, unless she provided me with a  khadi dhoti of forty-five inches within a month, I would do with coarse, short khadi dhoti.  The ultimatum came upon her as a shock. But she proved equal to the  demand made upon her. Well within the month she sent me a pair of  khadi dhotis of forty-five inches width, and thus relieved me from what would then have  been a difficult situation for me.  At about the same time Sjt. Lakshmidas brought Sjt. Ramji, the  weaver, with his wife Gangabehn from Lathi to the Ashram and got  khadi dhotis woven at the Ashram. The part played by this couple in the spread of  khadi was by no means insignificant. They initiated a host of  persons in Gujarat and also outside into the art of weaving hand-spun yarn. To see Gangabehn at her loom is a stirring sight. When this unlettered but self-possessed sister plies at her loom, she  becomes so lost in it that it is difficult to distract her  attention, and much more difficult to draw her eyes off her beloved  loom.  Before I reached home, the party which had started from Phoenix had already  arrived. According to our original plan I was to have preceded them,  but my preoccupation in England with the war had upset all our  calculations, and when I saw that I had to be detained in England  indefinitely, I was faced with the question of finding a place for  accommodating the Phoenix party. I wanted them all to stay together  in India, if possible, and to live the life they had led at Phoenix.  I did not know of any Ashram to which I could recommend them to go,  and therefore cabled to them to meet Mr. Andrews and do as he  advised.  So they were first put in the Gurukul, Kangri, where the late Swami  Shraddhanandji treated them as his own children. After this they  were put in the Shantiniketan Ashram, where the Poet and his people  showered similar love upon them. The experiences they gathered at  both these places too stood them and me in good stead.  The Poet, Shraddhanandji and Principal Sushil Rudra, as I used to  say to Andrews, composed this trinity. When in South Africa he was  never tired of speaking of them, and of my many sweet memories of  South Africa, Mr. Andrews' talks, day in and day out, of this great  trinity, are amongst the sweetest and most vivid. Mr. Andrews  naturally put the Phoenix party in touch with Sushil Rudra.  Principal Rudra had no Ashram, but he had a home which he placed  completely at the disposal of the Phoenix family. Within a day of  their arrival, his people made them feel so thoroughly at home that  they did not seem to miss Phoenix at all.  It was only when I landed in Bombay that I learnt that the Phoenix  party was at Shantiniketan. I was therefore impatient to meet them  as soon as I could after my meeting with Gokhale.  The receptions in Bombay gave me an occasion for offering what might be called a  little Satyagraha.  At the party given in my honour at Mr. Jehangir Petit's place, I did  not dare to speak in Gujarati. In those palatial surroundings of  dazzling splendour I, who had lived my best life among indentured  labourers, felt myself a complete rustic. With my Kathiawadi cloak,  turban and dhoti, I looked somewhat more civilized than I do today,  but the pomp and splendour of Mr. Petit's mansion made me feel  absolutely out of my element. However, I acquitted myself tolerably  well, having taken shelter under Sir Pherozeshah's protecting wing. Then there was the Gujarati function. The Gujaratis would not let me  go without a reception, which was organized by the late Uttamlal  Trivedi. I had acquainted myself with the programme beforehand. Mr.  Jinnah was present, being a Gujarati, I forget whether as president  or as the principal speaker. He made a short and sweet little speech  in English. As far as I remember most of the other speeches were  also in English. When my turn came, I expressed my thanks in  Gujarati explaining my partiality for Gujarati and Hindustani, and  entering my humble protest against the use of English in a Gujarati  gathering. This I did, not without some hesitation, for I was afraid  lest it should be considered discourteous for an inexperienced man,  returned home after a long exile, to enter his protest against  established practices. But no one seemed to misunderstand my  insistence on replying in Gujarati. In fact I was glad to note that  everyone seemed reconciled to my protest.  The meeting thus emboldened me to think that I should not find it  difficult to place my new-fangled notions before my countrymen. After a brief stay in Bombay, full of these preliminary experiences,  I went to Poona whither Gokhale had summoned me.  From Poona I went to Rajkot and Porbandar, where I had to meet my  brother's widow and other relatives.  During the Satyagraha in South Africa I had altered my style of  dress so as to make it more in keeping with that of the indentured labourers, and in England also I had adhered to the same style for indoor use. For landing in Bombay I had a Kathiawadi suit of clothes  consisting of a shirt, a dhoti, a cloak and a white scarf, all made  of Indian mill cloth. But as I was to travel third from Bombay, I  regarded the scarf and the cloak as too much of an encumbrance, so I  shed them, and invested in an eight-to-ten-annas Kashmiri cap. One  dressed in that fashion was sure to pass muster as a poor man. On account of the plague prevailing at that time, third class  passengers were being medically inspected at Viramgam or Wadhwan \u2013  I forget which. I had slight fever. The inspector on finding that I  had a temperature asked me to report myself to the Medical Officer  at Rajkot and noted down my name.  Someone had perhaps sent the information that I was passing through  Wadhwan, for the tailor Motilal, a noted public worker of the place,  met me at the station. He told me about the Viramgam customs, and  the hardships railway passengers had to suffer on account of it. I  had little inclination to talk because of my fever, and tried to  finish with a brief reply which took the form of a question:  'Are you prepared to go to jail?'  I had taken Motilal to be one of those impetuous youths who do not  think before speaking. But not so Motilal. He replied with firm  deliberation:  'We will certainly go to jail, provided you lead us. As Kathiawadis,  we have the first right on you. Of course we do not mean to detain  you now, but you must promise to halt here on your return. You will  be delighted to see the work and the spirit of our youths, and you  may trust us to respond as soon as you summon us.'  Motilal captivated me. His comrade eulogizing him, said:  'Our friend is but a tailor. But he is such a master of his  profession that he easily earns Rs.  a month \u2013  which is just what he  needs \u2013 working an hour a day, and gives the rest of his time to  public work. He leads us all, putting our education to shame.' Later I came in close contact with Motilal, and I saw that there was  no exaggeration in the eulogy. He made a point of spending some days  in the then newly started Ashram every month to teach the children  tailoring and to do some of the tailoring of the Ashram himself. He  would talk to me every day of Viramgam, and the hardships of the  passengers, which had become absolutely unbearable for him. He was  cut off in the prime of youth by a sudden illness, and public life  at Wadhwan suffered without him.  On reaching Rajkot, I reported myself to the Medical officer the  next morning. I was not unknown there. The Doctor felt ashamed and  was angry with the inspector. This was unnecessary, for the  inspector had only done his duty. He did not know me, and even if he  had known me, he should not have done otherwise. The Medical Officer  would not let me go to him again insisted on sending an inspector to  me instead.  Inspection of third class passengers for sanitary reasons is  essential on such occasions. If big men choose to travel third,  whatever their position in life, they must voluntarily submit  themselves to all the regulations that the poor are subject to, and  the officials ought to be impartial. My experience is that the  officials, instead of looking upon third class passengers as  fellowmen, regard them as so many sheep. They talk to them  contemptuously, and brook no reply or argument. The third class  passenger has to obey the official as though he were his servant,  and the letter may with impunity belabour and blackmail him, and  book him his ticket only after putting him to the greatest possible  inconvenience, including often missing the train. All this I have  seen with my own eyes. No reform is possible unless some of the  educated and the rich voluntarily accept the status of the poor,  travel third, refuse to enjoy the amenities denied to the poor and,  instead of taking avoidable hardships, discourtesies and injustice  as a matter of course, fight for their removal.  Wherever I went in Kathiawad I heard complaints about the Viramgam  customs hardships. I therefore decided immediately to make use of  Lord Willingdon's offer. I collected and read all the literature  available on the subject, convinced myself that the complaints were  well founded, and opened correspondence with the Bombay Government.  I called on the Private Secretary to Lord Willingdon and waited on  His Excellency also. The latter expressed his sympathy but shifted  the blame on Delhi. 'If it had been in our hands, we should have  removed the cordon long ago. You should approach the Government of  India,' said the Secretary.  I communicated with the Government of India, but got no reply beyond  an acknowledgment. It was only when I had an occasion to meet Lord  Chelmsford later that redress could be had. When I placed the facts  before him, he expressed his astonishment. He had known nothing of  the matter. He gave me a patient hearing, telephoned that very  moment for papers about Viramgam, and promised to remove the cordon  if the authorities had no explanation or defence to offer. Within a  few days of this interview I read in the papers that the Viramgam  customs cordon had been removed.  I regarded this event as the advent of Satyagraha in India. For  during my interview with the Bombay Government the Secretary had  expressed his disapproval of a reference to Satyagraha in a speech  which I had delivered in Bagasra (in Kathiawad).  'Is not this a threat?' he had asked. 'And do you think a powerful  Government will yield to threats?'  'This was no threat,' I had replied. 'It was educating the people.  It is my duty to place before the people all the legitimate remedies  for grievances. A nation that wants to come into its own ought to  know all the ways and means to freedom. Usually they include  violence as the last remedy. Satyagraha, on the other hand, is an  absolutely non-violent weapon. I regard it as my duty to explain  its practice and its limitations. I have no doubt that the British  Government is a powerful Government, but I have no doubt also that  Satyagraha is a sovereign remedy.'  The clever Secretary nodded his head and said: 'We shall see.'  The moment I reached Bombay Gokhale sent me word that the Governor was  desirous of seeing me, and that it might be proper for me to respond  before I left for Poona. Accordingly I called on His Excellency.  After the usual inquiries, he said:  'I ask one thing of you. I would like you to come and see me  whenever you propose to take any steps concerning Government.' I replied:  'I can very easily give the promise, inasmuch as it is my rule, as a  Satyagrahi, to understand the viewpoint of the party I propose to  deal with, and to try to agree with him as far as may be possible. I  strictly observed the rule in South Africa and I mean to do the same  here.'  Lord Willingdon thanked me and said:  'You may come to me whenever you like, and you will see that my Government do not willfully do  anything wrong.'  To which I replied: 'It is that faith which sustains me.' After this I went to Poona. It is impossible for me to set down all  the reminiscences of this precious time. Gokhale and the members of  the Servants of India Society overwhelmed me with affection. So far  as I recollect, Gokhale had summoned all of them to meet me. I had a  frank talk with them all on every sort of subject.  Gokhale was very keen that I should join the Society and so was I.  But the members felt that, as there was a great difference between  my ideals and methods of work and theirs, it might not be proper for  me to join the Society. Gokhale believed that, in spite of my  insistence on my own principles, I was equally ready and able to  tolerate theirs.  'But,' he said, 'the members of the Society have not yet understood  your readiness for compromise. They are tenacious of their  principles, and quite independent. I am hoping that they will accept  you, but if they don't, you will not for a moment think that they are  lacking in respect or love for you. They are hesitating to take any  risk lest their high regard for you should be jeopardized. But  whether you are formally admitted as a member or not, I am going to  look upon you as one.'  I informed Gokhale of my intentions. Whether I was admitted as a  member or not, I wanted to have an Ashram where I could settle down  with my Phoenix family, preferably somewhere in Gujarat, as, being a  Gujarati, I thought I was best fitted to serve the country through  serving Gujarat. Gokhale liked the idea. He said: 'You should  certainly do so. Whatever may be the result of your talks with the  members, you must look to me for the expenses of the Ashram, which I  will regard as my own.'  My heart overflowed with joy. It was a pleasure to feel free from  the responsibility of raising funds, and to realize that I should  not be obliged to set about the work all on my own, but that I  should be able to count on a sure guide whenever I was in  difficulty. This took a great load off my mind.  So the late Dr. Dev was summoned and told to open an account for me  in the Society's books and to give me whatever I might require for  the Ashram and for public expenses.  I now prepared to go to Shantiniketan. On the eve of my departure  Gokhale arranged a party of selected friends, taking good care to  order refreshments of my liking, i.e., fruits and nuts. The party  was held just a few paces from his room, and yet he was hardly in a  condition to walk across and attend it. But his affection for me got  the better of him and he insisted on coming. He came, but fainted  and had to be carried away. Such fainting was not a new thing with  him and so when he came to, he sent word that we must go on with the  party.  This party was of course no more than a conversazione in the open  space opposite the Society's guesthouse, during which friends had  heart-to-heart chats over light refreshments of groundnuts, dates  and fresh fruits of the season.  But the fainting fit was to be no common event in my life.   At Burdwan we came face to face with the hardships that a third class  passenger has to go through even in securing his ticket. 'Third class  tickets are not booked so early,' we were told. I went to the  Station Master, though that too was a difficult business. Someone  kindly directed me to where he was, and I represented to him our  difficulty. He also made the same reply. As soon as the booking  window opened, I went to purchase the tickets. But it was no easy  thing to get them. Might was right, and passengers, who were forward  and indifferent to others, coming one after another, continued to  push me out. I was therefore about the last of the first crowd to  get a ticket.  The train arrived, and getting into it was another trial. There was  a free exchange of abuse and pushes between passengers already in  the train and those trying to get in. We ran up and down the  platform, but were everywhere met with the same reply: 'No room  here.' I went to the guard. He said, 'You must try to get in where  you can or take the next train.'  'But I have urgent business,' I respectfully replied. He had no time  to listen to me. I was disconcerted. I told Maganlal to get in  wherever possible, and I got into an inter-class compartment with my  wife. The guard saw us getting in. At Asansol station he came to  charge us excess fares. I said to him:  'It was your duty to find us room. We could not get any, and so we  are sitting here. If you can accommodate us in a third class  compartment, we shall be only too glad to go there.'  'You may not argue with me,' said the guard. 'I cannot accommodate  you. You must pay the excess fare, or get out.'  I wanted to reach Poona somehow. I was not therefore prepared to  fight the guard, so I paid the excess fare he demanded, i.e., up to  Poona. But I resented the injustice.  In the morning we reached Mogalsarai. Maganlal had managed to get a  seat in the third class, to which I now shifted.\u00a0 I acquainted  the ticket examiner with all the facts, and asked him to give me a  certificate to the effect that I had shifted to a third class  compartment at Mogalsarai. This he declined to do. I applied to the  railway authorities for redress, and got a reply to this effect: 'It  is not our practice to refund excess fares without the production of  a certificate, but we make an exception in your case. It is not  possible, however, to refund the excess fare from Burdwan to  Mogalsarai.'  Since this I have had experiences of third class travelling which,  if I wrote them all down, would easily fill a volume. But I can only  touch on them causally in these chapters. It has been and always  will be my profound regret that physical incapacity should have  compelled me to give up third class travelling.  The woes of third class passengers are undoubtedly due to the high-handedness  of railway authorities. But the rudeness, dirty habits,  selfishness and ignorance of the passengers themselves are no less  to blame. The pity is that they often do not realize that they are  behaving ill, dirtily or selfishly. They believe that everything  they do is in the natural way. All this may be traced to the  indifference towards them of us 'educated' people.  We reached Kalyan dead tried. Maganlal and I got some water from the  station water-pipe and had our bath. As I was proceeding to arrange  for my wife's bath, Sjt. Kaul of the Servants of India Society  recognizing us came up. He too was going to Poona. He offered to  take my wife to the second class bath room. I hesitated to accept  the courteous offer. I knew that my wife had no right to avail  herself of the second class bathroom, But I ultimately connived at  the impropriety. This, I know, does not become a votary of truth.  Not that my wife was eager to use the bath room, but a husband's  partiality for his wife got the better of his partiality for Truth.  The face of truth is hidden behind the golden veil of maya, says  the Upanishad.  From Rajkot I proceeded to Shantiniketan. The teachers and students  overwhelmed me with affection. The reception was a beautiful  combination of simplicity, art and love. It was here I met Kakasaheb  Kalelkar for the first time.  I did not know then why Kalelkar was called 'Kakasaheb'. But I  learnt later on that Sjt. Keshavrao Deshpande, who was a  contemporary and a close friend of mine in England, and who had  conducted a school in the Baroda State called 'Ganganath Vidyalaya',  had given the teachers family names with a view to investing the  Vidyalaya with a family atmosphere. Sjt. Kalelkar who was a teacher  there came to be called, 'Kaka' (literaly, paternal uncle), Phadke was  called 'Mama' (literaly, maternal uncle), and Harihar Sharma received the  name 'Anna' (literaly, brother). Others also got similar names. Anandanand  (Swami) as Kaka's friend and Patwardhan (Appa) as Mama's  friend later joined the family, and all in course of time became my  co-workers one after another. Sjt. Deshpande himself used to be  called 'Saheb'. When the Vidyalaya had to be dissolved, the family  also broke up, but they never gave up their spiritual relationship  or their assumed names.  Kakasaheb went out to gain experience of different institutions, and  at the time I went to Shantiniketan, he happened to be there.  Chintaman Shastri, belonging to the same fraternity, was there also.  Both helped in teaching Samskrit.  The Phoenix family had been assigned separate quarters at  Shantiniketan. Maganlal Gandhi was at their head, and he had made it  his business to see that all the rules of the Phoenix Ashram should  be scrupulously observed. I saw that, by dint of his love, knowledge  and perseverance, he had made his fragrance felt in  the whole of Shantiniketan.  Andrews was there, and also Pearson. Amongst the Bengali teachers  with whom we came in fairly close contact were Jagadanandbabu,  Nepalbabu, Santoshbabu, Kshitimohanbabu, Nagenbabu, Sharadbabu and  Kalibabu.  As is my wont, I quickly mixed with the teachers and students, and  engaged them in a discussion on self-help. I put it to the teachers  that, if they and the boys dispensed with the services of paid cooks  and cooked their food themselves, it would enable the teachers to  control the kitchen from the point of view of the boy's physical and  moral health, and it would afford to the students an object-lesson  in self-help. One or two of them were inclined to shake their heads.  Some of them strongly approved of the proposal. The boys welcomed  it, if only because of their instinctive taste for novelty. So we  launched the experiment. When I invited the Poet to express his  opinion, he said that he did not mind it provided the teachers were  favourable. To the boys he said, 'The experiment contains the key to  Swaraj.'  Pearson began to wear away his body in making the experiment a  success. He threw himself into it with zest. A batch was formed to  cut vegetables, another to clean the grain, and so on. Nagenbabu and  others undertook to see to the sanitary cleaning of the kitchen and  its surroundings. It was a delight to me to see them working spade  in hand.  But it was too much to expect the hundred and twenty-five boys with  their teachers to take to this work of physical labour like ducks to  water. There used to be daily discussion. Some began early to show  fatigue. But Pearson was not the man to be tired. One would always  find him with his smiling face doing something or other in or about  the kitchen. He had taken upon himself the cleaning of the bigger  utensils. A party of students played on their sitar  before this cleaning party in order to beguile the tedium of the  operation. All alike took the thing up with zest and Shantiniketan  became a busy hive.  Changes like these when once begun always develop. Not only was the  Phoenix party's kitchen self-conducted, but the food cooked in it  was of the simplest. Condiments were eschewed. Rice, dal,  vegetables and even wheat flour were all cooked at one and the same  time in a steam cooker. And Shantiniketan boys started a similar kitchen with a view to introducing reform in the Bengali  kitchen. One or two teachers and some students ran this kitchen. The experiment was, however, dropped after some time. I am of the opinion  that the famous institution lost nothing by having conducted the  experiment for a brief interval, and some of the experiences gained  could not but be of help to the teachers.  I had intended to stay at Shantiniketan for some time, but fate  willed otherwise. I had hardly been there a week when I received  from Poona a telegram announcing Gokhale's death. Shantiniketan was  immersed in grief. All the members came over to me to express their  condolences. A special meeting was called in the Ashram temple to  mourn the national loss. It was a solemn function. The same day I  left for Poona with my wife and Maganlal. All the rest stayed at  Shantiniketan.  Andrews accompanied me up to Burdwan. 'Do you think,' he asked me,  'that a time will come for Satyagraha in India? And if so, have you  any idea when it will come?'  'It is difficult to say,' said I. 'For one year I am to do nothing.  For Gokhale took from me a promise that I should travel in India for  gaining experience, and express no opinion on public questions until  I have finished the period of probation. Even after the year is  over, I will be in no hurry to speak and pronounce opinions. And so  I do not suppose there will be any occasion for Satyagraha for five  years or so.'  I may note in this connection that Gokhale used to laugh at some of  my ideas in Hind Swaraj (Indian Home Rule)  and say: 'After you have stayed a year in India, your views will  correct themselves.'  I next went to Rangoon to meet Dr. Mehta, and on my way I halted at  Calcutta. I was the guest of the late Babu Bhupendranath Basu.  Bengali hospitality reached its climax here. In those days I was a  strict fruitarian, so all the fruits and nuts available in Calcutta  were ordered for me. The ladies of the house kept awake all night  skinning various nuts. Every possible care was taken in dressing  fresh fruit in the Indian style. Numerous delicacies were prepared  for my companions, amongst whom was my son Ramdas. Much as I could  appreciate this affectionate hospitality, I could not bear the  thought of a whole household being occupied in entertaining two or  three guests. But as yet I saw no escape from such embarrassing  attentions.  On the boat going to Rangoon I was a deck passenger. If excess of  attention embarrassed us in Sjt. Basu's house, grossest inattention,  even to the elementary comforts of deck passengers, was our lot on  the boat. What was an apology for a bath room was unbearably dirty,  the latrines were stinking sinks. To use the latrine one had to wade  through urine and excreta or jump over them.  This was more than flesh and blood could bear. I approached the  Chief Officer without avail. If anything was lacking to complete the  picture of stink and filth, the passengers furnished it by their  thoughtless habits. They spat where they sat, dirtied the  surroundings with the leavings of their food, tobacco and betel  leaves. There was no end to the noise, and everyone tried to  monopolize as much room as possible. Their luggage took up more room  than they. We had thus two days of the severest trial.  On reaching Rangoon I wrote to the Agent of the Steamship Company,  acquainting him with all the facts. Thanks to this letter and to Dr.  Mehta's efforts in the matter, the return journey, though on deck was  less unbearable.  In Rangoon my fruitarian diet was again a source of additional  trouble to the host. But since Dr. Mehta's home was as good as my  own, I could control somewhat the lavishness of the menu. However,  as I had not set any limit to the number of articles I might eat,  the palate and the eyes refused to put an effective check on the  supply of varieties ordered. There were no regular hours for meals.  Personally I preferred having the last meal before night fall.  Nevertheless as a rule it could not be had before eight or nine. This year \u2013  \u2013 was the year of the Kumbha fair, which is held at  Hardvar once every  years. I was by no means eager to attend the  fair, but I was anxious to meet Mahatma Munshiramji who was in his  Gurukul. Gokhale's Society had sent a big volunteer corps for  service at the Kumbha. Pandit Hridayanath Kunzru was at the head,  and the late Dr. Dev was the medical officer. I was invited to send  the Phoenix party to assist them, and so Maganlal Gandhi had already  preceded me. On my return from Rangoon, I joined the band. The journey from Calcutta to Hardvar was particularly trying.  Sometimes the compartments had no lights. From Saharanpur we were  huddled into carriages for goods or cattle. These had no roofs, and  what with the blazing midday sun overhead and the scorching iron  floor beneath, we were all but roasted. The pangs of thirst, caused  by even such a journey as this, could not persuade orthodox Hindus  to take water, if it was 'Musalmani.' They waited until they could  get the 'Hindu' water. These very Hindus, let it be noted, do not so  much as hesitate or inquire when during illness the doctor  administers them wine or prescribes beef tea or a Musalman or  Christian compounder gives them water.  Our stay in Shantiniketan had  taught us that the scavenger's work would be our special function in  India. Now for the volunteers in Hardvar tents had been pitched in a dharmashala, and Dr. Dev had dug some pits to be used as latrines.  He had to depend on paid scavengers for looking after these. Here  was work for the Phoenix party. We offered to cover up the excreta  with earth and to see to their disposal, and Dr. Dev gladly accepted  our offer. The offer was naturally made by me, but it was Maganlal  Gandhi who had to execute it. My business was mostly to keep sitting  in the tent giving darshan and holding religious and other  discussions with numerous pilgrims who called on me. This left me  not a minute which I could call my own. I was followed even to the  bathing ghat by these darshan-seekers, nor did they leave me  alone whilst I was having my meals. Thus it was in Hardvar that I  realized what a deep impression my humble services in South Africa  had made throughout the whole of India.  But this was no enviable position to be in. I felt as though I was  between the devil and the deep sea. Where no one recognized me, I  had to put up with the hardships that fall to the lot of the  millions in this land, e.g., in railway travelling. Where I  was surrounded by people who had heard of me I was the victim of  their craze for darshan. Which of the two conditions was more pitiable,  I have often been at a loss to determine. This at least I know that  the darshanvalas' blind love has often made me angry, and more  often sore at heart. Whereas travelling, though often trying, has  been uplifting and has hardly ever roused me to anger.  I was in those days strong enough to roam about a lot, and was  fortunately not so known as not to be able to go in the streets  without creating much fuss. During these roamings I came to observe  more of the pilgrims' absent mindedness, hypocrisy and slovenliness,  than of their piety. The swarm of sadhus, who had descended there,  seemed to have been born to enjoy the good things of life. Here I saw a cow with five feet! I was astonished, but knowing men  soon disillusioned me. The poor five-footed cow was a sacrifice to  the greed of the wicked. I learnt that the fifth foot was nothing  else but a foot cut off from a live calf and grafted upon the  shoulder of the cow! The result of this double cruelty was exploited  to fleece the ignorant of their money. There was no Hindu but would  be attracted by a five-footed cow, and no Hindu but would lavish his  charity on such a miraculous cow.  The day of the fair was now upon us. It proved a red letter day for  me. I had not gone to Hardvar with the sentiments of a pilgrim. I  have never thought of frequenting places of pilgrimage in search of  piety. But the seventeen lakhs of men that were reported to be there  could not all be hypocrites or mere sight-seers. I had no doubt that  countless people amongst them had gone there to earn merit and for  self-purification. It is difficult, if not impossible, to say to  what extent this kind of faith uplifts the soul.  I therefore passed the whole night immersed in deep thought. There  were those pious souls in the midst of the hypocrisy that surrounded  them. They would be free of guilt before their Maker. If the visit  to Hardvar was in itself a sin, I must publicly protest against it,  and leave Hardvar on the day Kumbha. If the pilgrimage to Hardvar  and to the Kumbha fair was not sinful, I must impose some act of  self-denial on myself in atonement for the iniquity prevailing there  and purify myself. This was quite natural for me. My life is based  on disciplinary resolutions. I thought of the unnecessary trouble I  had caused to my hosts at Calcutta and Rangoon, who had so lavishly  entertained me. I therefore decided to limit the articles of my  daily diet and to have my final meal before sunset. I was convinced  that, if I did not impose these restrictions on myself, I should put  my future hosts to considerable inconvenience and should engage them  in serving me rather than engage myself in service. So I pledged  myself never whilst in India to take more than five articles in  twenty-four hours, and never to eat after dark. I gave the fullest  thought to the difficulties I might have to face. But I wanted to  leave no loophole. I rehearsed to myself what would happen during an  illness, if I counted medicine among the five articles, and made no  exception in favour of special articles of diet. I finally decided  that there should be no exception on any account whatsoever. I have been under these vows for now thirteen years. They have  subjected me to a severe test, but I am able to testify that they  have also served as my shield. I am of opinion that they have added  a few years to my life and saved me from many an illness.  On arrival in Poona, we found ourselves, after the performance of the shradha ceremonies, discussing the future of the Society, and the question  as to whether I should join it or not. This question of membership  proved a very delicate matter for me to handle. Whilst Gokhale was  there I did not have to seek admission as a member. I had simply to  obey his wish, a position I loved to be in. Launching on the stormy  sea of Indian public life, I was in need of a sure pilot. I had one  in Gokhale and had felt secure in his keeping. Now that he was gone,  I was thrown on my own resources, and I felt that it was my duty to  seek admission. That, I thought, would please Gokhale's spirit. So,  without hesitation and with firmness, I began the wooing. Most of the members of the Society were in Poona at this juncture. I  set about pleading with them and tried to dispel their fears about  me. But I saw that they were divided. One section favoured my  admission, the other was strongly against it. I knew that neither  yielded to the other in its affection for me, but possibly their  loyalty to the Society was greater, at any rate not less than their  love for me. All our discussions were therefore free from  bitterness, and strictly confined to matters of principle. The  section that was opposed to me held that they and I were as the  poles asunder in various vital matters, and they felt my membership  was likely to imperil the very objects for which the Society was  founded. This naturally was more than they could bear.  We dispersed after prolonged discussions, the final decision being  postponed to a later date.  I was considerably agitated as I returned home. Was it right for me  to be admitted by a majority vote? Would it be consonant with my  loyalty to Gokhale? I saw clearly that, when there was such a sharp  division amongst the members of the Society over admitting me, by  far the best course for me was to withdraw my application for  admission and save those opposed to me from a delicate situation.  Therein I thought lay my loyalty to the Society and Gokhale. The  decision came to me in a flash, and immediately I wrote to Mr.  Shastri asking him not to have the adjourned meeting at all. Those  who had opposed my application fully appreciated the decision. It  saved them from an awkward position and bound us in closer bonds of  friendship. The withdrawal of my application made me truly a member  of the Society.  Experience now tells me that it was well that I did not formally  become a member, and that the opposition of those who had been  against me was justified. Experience has shown too that our views on  matters of principle were widely divergent. But the recognition of  the differences has meant no estrangement or bitterness between us.  We have remained as brothers, and the Society's Poona home has  It is true that I did not officially become a member of the Society,  but I have ever been a member in spirit. Spiritual relationship is  far more precious than physical. Physical relationship divorced from spiritual  is body without soul.   The pilgrimage to the Kumbha fair was my second visit to Hardvar. The Satyagraha Ashram was founded on the th of May, .  Shraddhanandji wanted me to settle in Hardvar. Some of my Calcutta  friends recommended Vaidyanathadham. Others strongly urged me to  choose Rajkot. But when I happened to pass through Ahmedabad, many  friends pressed me to settle down there, and they volunteered to  find the expenses of the Ashram, as well as a house for us to live  in.  I had a predilection for Ahmedabad. Being a Gujarati I thought I  should be able to render the greatest service to the country through  the Gujarati language. And then, as Ahmedabad was an ancient centre  of handloom weaving, it was likely to be the most favourable field  for the revival of the cottage industry of hand-spinning. There was  also the hope that, the city being the capital of Gujarat, monetary  help from its wealthy citizens would be more available here than  elsewhere.  The question of untouchability was naturally among the subjects  discussed with the Ahmedabad friends. I made it clear to them that I  should take the first opportunity of admitting an untouchable  candidate to the Ashram if he was otherwise worthy.  'Where is the untouchable who will satisfy your condition?' said a  vaishnava friend self-complacently.  I finally decided to found the Ashram at Ahmedabad.  So far as accommodation was concerned, Sjt. Jivanlal Desai, a  barrister in Ahmedabad, was the principal man to help me. He offered  to let, and we decided to hire, his Kochrab bungalow.  The first thing we had to settle was the name of the Ashram. I  consulted friends. Amongst the names suggested were 'Sevashram' (the  abode of service), 'Tapovan' (the abode of austerities), etc. I liked  the name 'Sevashram' but for the absence of emphasis on the method  of service. 'Tapovan' seemed to be a pretentious title, because  though tapas was dear to us we would not presume to be  tapasvins (men of austerity). Our creed was devotion to truth, and our  business was the search for and insistence on truth. I wanted to  acquaint India with the method I had tried in South Africa, and I  desired to test in India the extent to which its application might  be possible. So my companions and I selected the name 'Satyagraha  Ashram', as conveying both our goal and our method of service. For the conduct of the Ashram a code of rules and observances was  necessary. A draft was therefore prepared, and friends were invited  to express their opinions on it. Amongst the many opinions that were  received, that of Sir Gurudas Banerji is still in my memory. He  liked the rules, but suggested that humility should be added as one  of the observances, as he believed that the younger generation sadly  lacked humility. Though I noticed this fault, I feared humility  would cease to be humility the moment it became a matter of vow. The  true connotation of humility is self-effacement. Self-effacement is moksha (salvation), and whilst it cannot, by itself, be an observance,  there may be other observances necessary for its attainment. If the  acts of an aspirant after moksha or a servant have no humility  or selflessness about them, there is no longing for moksha  or service. Service without humility is selfishness and egotism. There were at this time about thirteen Tamilians in our party. Five  Tamil youngsters had accompanied me from South Africa, and the rest  came from different parts of the country. We were in all about  twenty- five men and women.  This is how the Ashram started. All had their meals in a common  kitchen and strove to live as one family.  It was a positive relief to reach the Gurukul and meet Mahatma  Munshiramji with his giant frame. I at once felt the wonderful  contrast between the peace of the Gurukul and the din and noise of  Hardvar. The Mahatma overwhelmed me with affection. The Brahmacharis  were all attention. It was here that I was first introduced to  Acharya Ramadevji, and I could immediately see what a force and a  power he must be. We had different viewpoints in several matters,  nevertheless our acquaintance soon ripened into friendship. I had long discussions with Acharya Ramadevji and other professors  about the necessity of introducing industrial training into the  Gurukul. When the time came for going away it was a wrench to leave  the place.  I had heard much in praise of the Lakshman Jhula (a hanging bridge  over the Ganges) some distance from Hrishikesh, and many friends  pressed me not to leave Hardvar without having gone as far as the  bridge. I wanted to do this pilgrimage on foot and so I did it in  two stages.  Many sannyasis called on me at Hrishikesh. One of them was  particularly attracted towards me. The Phoenix party was there and  their presence drew from the Swami many questions.  We had discussions about religion and he realized that I felt deeply  about matters of religion. He saw me bareheaded and shirtless as I  had returned from my bath in the Ganges. He was pained to miss the shikha (tuft of hair) on my head and the sacred thread about my neck and said:  'It pains me to see you, a believing Hindu, going without a sacred  thread and the shikha. These are the two external symbols of  Hinduism and every Hindu ought to wear them.'  Now there is a history as to how I came to dispense with both. When  I was an urchin of ten, I envied the Brahman lads sporting bunches  of keys tied to their sacred threads, and I wished I could do  likewise. The practice of wearing the sacred thread was not then  common among the vaishya families in Kathiawad. But a movement had just been started for  making it obilgatory for the first three varnas.  As a result several members of the Gandhi clan adopted the sacred  thread. The Brahman who was teaching two or three of us boys Ramraksha  invested us with the thread, and although I had no occasion to  possess a bunch of keys, I got one and began to sport it. Later,  when the thread gave way, I do not remember whether I missed it very  much. But I know that I did not go in for a fresh one. As I grew up several well-meaning attempts were made both in India  and South Africa to re-invest me with the sacred thread, but with  little success. If the shudras may not wear it, I argued, what  right have the other varnas to do so? And I saw no adequate reason  for adopting what was to me an unnecessary custom. I had no objection  to the thread as such, but the reasons for wearing it were lacking. As a vaishnava I had naturally worn round my neck the kanthi,  and the shikha was considered obligatory by elders. On the eve of my going to  England, however, I got rid of the shikha,  lest when I was bare-headed it should expose me to ridicule and make  me look, as I then thought, a barbarian in the eyes of the  Englishmen. In fact this cowardly feeling carried me so far that in  South Africa I got my cousin Chhaganlal Gandhi, who was religiously  wearing the shikha, to do away with it. I feared that it might come in the way of his  public work and so, even at the risk of paining him, I made him get  rid of it.  I therefore made a clean breast of the whole matter to the Swami and  said:  'I will not wear the sacred thread, for I see no necessity for it,  when countless Hindus can go without it and yet remain Hindus.  Moreover, the sacred thread should be a symbol of spiritual  regeneration, presupposing a deliberate attempt on the part of the  wearer at a higher and purer life. I doubt, whether in the present  state of Hinduism and of India, Hindus can vindicate the right to  wear a symbol charged with such a meaning. That right can come only  after Hinduism has purged itself of untouchability, has removed all  distinctions of superiority and inferiority, and shed a host of  other evils and shams that have become rampant in it. My mind  therefore rebels against the idea of wearing the sacred thread. But  I am sure your suggestion about the shikha is worth considering. I  once used to have it, and I discarded it from a false sense of  shame. And so I feel that I should start growing it again. I shall  discuss the matter with my comrades.'  The Swami did not appreciate my position with regard to the sacred  thread. The very reasons that seemed to me to point to not wearing  it appeared to him to favour its wearing. Even today my position  remains about the same as it was at Hrishikesh. So long as there are  different religions, every one of them may need some outward  distinctive symbol. But when the symbol is made into a fetish and an  instrument of proving the superiority of one's religion over  others', it is fit only to be discarded. The sacred thread does not  appear to me today to be a means of uplifting Hinduism. I am  therefore indifferent to it. As for the shikha,  cowardice having been the reason for discarding it, after  consultation with friends I decided to re-grow it.  But to return to Lakshman Jhula. I was charmed with the natural  scenery about Hrishikesh and the Lakshman Jhula, and bowed my head  in reverence to our ancestors for their sense of the beautiful in  Nature, and for their foresight in investing beautiful  manifestations of nature with a religious significance. But the way in which men were using these beauty spots was far from  giving me peace. As at Hardvar, so at Hrishikesh, people dirtied the  roads and the fair banks of the Ganges. They did not even hesitate  to desecrate the sacred water of the Ganges. It filled me with agony  to see people performing natural functions on the thoroughfares and  river banks, when they could easily have gone a little farther away  from public haunts.  Lakshman Jhula was, I saw, nothing but an iron suspension bridge  over the Ganges. I was told that originally there had been a fine  rope-bridge. But a philanthropic Marwadi got it into his head to  destroy the rope-bridge and erect an iron one at a heavy cost and  then entrusted the keys to the Government! I am at a loss to say  anything about the rope-bridge as I have never seen it, but the iron  bridge is entirely out of place in such surroundings and mars their  beauty. The making over of the keys of this pilgrims' bridge to the  Government was too much even for my loyalty of those days.  The Svargashram which one reaches after crossing the bridge was a wretched place,  being nothing but a number of shabby-looking sheds of galvanized  iron sheets. These, I was told, were made for sadhakas  (aspirants). There were hardly any living there at the moment. Those  who were in the main building gave one an unfavourable impression. But the Hardvar experiences proved for me to be of inestimable  value. They helped me in no small way to decide where I was to live  and what I was to do.  I knew Maulana Mazharul Haq in London when he was studying for the  bar, and when I met him at the Bombay Congress in  \u2013 the year in  which he was President of the Muslim League \u2013 he had renewed the  acquaintance, and extended me an invitation to stay with him  whenever I happened to go to Patna. I bethought myself of this  invitation and sent him a note indicating the purpose of my visit.  He immediately came in his car, and pressed me to accept his  hospitality. I thanked him and requested him to guide me to my  destination by the first available train, the railway guide being  useless to an utter stranger like me. He had a talk with Rajkumar  Shukla and suggested that I should first go to Muzaffarpur. There  was a train for that place the same evening, and he sent me off by  it.  Principal Kripalani was then in Muzaffarpur. I had known of him ever  since my visit to Hyderabad. Dr. Choithram had told me of his great  sacrifice, of his simple life, and of the Ashram that Dr. Choithram  was running out of funds provided by Professor Kripalani. He used to be  a professor in the Government College, Muzaffarpur, and had just  resigned the post when I went there. I had sent a telegram informing  him of my arrival, and he met me at the station with a crowd of  students, though the train reached there at midnight. He had no  rooms of his own, and was staying with Professor Malkani who  therefore virtually became my host. It was an extraordinary thing in  those days for a Government professor to harbour a man like me.  Professor Kripalani spoke to me about the desperate condition of  Bihar, particularly of the Tirhut division and gave me an idea of  the difficulty of my task. He had established very close contact  with the Biharis, and had already spoken to them about the mission  that took me to Bihar.  In the morning a small group of vakils called on me. I still  remember Ramnavmi Prasad among them, as his earnestness specially  appealed to me.  'It is not possible,' he said, 'for you to do the kind of work you  have come for, if you stay here (meaning Professor Malkani's quarters).  You must come and stay with one of us. Gaya Babu is a well-known  vakil here. I have come on his behalf in invite you to stay with  him. I confess we are all afraid of Government, but we shall render  what help we can. Most of the things Rajkumar Shukla has told you  are true. It is a pity our leaders are not here today. I have,  however, wired to them both, Bapu Brajkishore Prasad and Babu  Rajendra Prasad. I expect them to arrive shortly, and they are sure  to be able to give you all the information you want and to help you  considerably. Pray come over to Gaya Babu's place.'  This was a request that I could not resist, though I hesitated for  fear of embarrassing Gaya Babu. But he put me at ease, and so I went  over to stay with him. He and his people showered all their  affection on me.  Brajkishore Babu now arrived from Darbhanga and Rajendra Babu from  Puri. Brajkishore Babu was not the Babu Brajkishore Prasad I had met  in Lucknow. He impressed me this time with his humility, simplicity,  goodness and extraordinary faith, so characteristic of the Biharis,  and my heart was joyous over it. The Bihar vakils' regard for him  was an agreeable surprise to me.  Soon I felt myself becoming bound to this circle of friends in  life-long friendship. Brajkishore Babu acquainted me with the facts of  the case. He used to be in the habit of taking up the cases of the  poor tenants. There were two such cases pending when I went there.  When he won any such case, he consoled himself that he was doing  something good for these poor people. Not that he did not  charge fees from these simple peasants. Lawyers labour under the  belief that, if they do not charge fees, they will have no  wherewithal to run their households, and will not be able to render  effective help to the poor people. The figures of the fees they  charged and the standard of a barrister's fees in Bengal and Bihar  staggered me.  'We gave Rs. , to so and so for his opinion,' I was told.  Nothing less than four figures in any case.  The friends listened to my kindly reproach and did not misunderstand  me.  'Having studied these cases,' said I, 'I have come to the conclusion  that we should stop going to law courts. Taking such cases to the  courts does little good. Where the ryots are so crushed and fear-  stricken, law courts are useless. The real relief for them is to be  free from fear. We cannot sit still until we have driven tinkathia  out of Bihar. I had thought that I should be able to leave here in  two days, but I now realize that the work might take even two years.  I am prepared to give that time, if necessary. I am now feeling my  ground, but I want your help.'  I found Brajkishore Babu exceptionally coolheaded. 'We shall render  all the help we can,' he said quietly, 'but pray tell us what kind  of help you will need.'  And thus we sat talking until midnight.  'I shall have little use for your legal knowledge,' I said to them.  'I want clerical assistance and help in interpretation. It may be  necessary to face imprisonment, but, much as I would love you to run  that risk, you would go only so far as you feel  yourselves capable of going. Even turning yourselves into clerks and  giving up your profession for an indefinite period is no small  thing. I find it difficult to understand the local dialect of Hindi,  and I shall not be able to read papers written in Kaithi or Urdu. I  shall want you to translate them for me. We cannot afford to pay for  this work. It should all be done for love and out of a spirit of  service.'  Brajkishore Babu understood this immediately, and he now  cross-examined me and his companions by turns. He tried to ascertain  the implications of all that I had said \u2013 how long their service would  be required, how many of them would be needed, whether they might  serve by turns and so on. Then he asked the vakils the capacity of  their sacrifice.  Ultimately they gave me this assurance. 'Such and such a number of  us will do whatever you may ask. Some of us will be with you for so  much time as you may require. The idea of accommodating oneself to  imprisonment is a novel thing for us. We will try to assimilate it.'  The Ashram had been in existence only a few months when we were put to a  test such as I had scarcely expected. I received a letter from  Amritlal Thakkar to this effect: 'A humble and honest untouchable  family is desirous of joining your Ashram. Will you accept them?' I was perturbed. I had never expected that an untouchable family  with an introduction from no less a man than Thakkar Bapa would so  soon be seeking admission to the Ashram. I shared the letter with my  companions. They welcomed it.  I wrote to Amritlal Thakkar expressing our willingness to accept the  family, provided all the members were ready to abide by the rules of  the Ashram.  The family consisted of Dudabhai, his wife Danibehn and their  daughter Lakshmi, then a mere toddling babe. Dudabhai had been a  teacher in Bombay. They all agreed to abide by the rules and were  accepted.  But their admission created a flutter amongst the friends who had  been helping the Ashram. The very first difficulty was found with  regard to the use of the well, which was partly controlled by the  owner of the bungalow. The man in charge of the water-lift objected  that drops of water from our bucket would pollute him. So he took to  swearing at us and molesting Dudabhai. I told everyone to put up  with the abuse and continue drawing water at any cost. When he saw  that we did not return his abuse, the man became ashamed and ceased  to bother us.  All monetary help, however, was stopped. The friend who had asked  that question about an untouchable being able to follow the rules of  the Ashram had never expected that any such would be forthcoming.  With the stopping of monetary help came rumours of proposed social  boycott. We were prepared for all this. I had told my companions  that, if we were boycotted and denied the usual facilities, we would  not leave Ahmedabad. We would rather go and stay in the  untouchables' quarters and live on whatever we could get by manual labour. Matters came to such a pass that Maganlal Gandhi one day gave me  this notice: 'We are out of funds and there is nothing for the next  month.'  I quietly replied: 'Then we shall go to the untouchables' quarter.' This was not the first time I had been faced with such a trial. On  all such occasions God has sent help at the last moment. One  morning, shortly after Maganlal had given me warning of our monetary  plight, one of the children came and said that a Sheth who was  waiting in a car outside wanted to see me. I went out to him. 'I  want to give the Ashram some help.' Will you accept it?' 'Most certainly,' said I. 'And I confess I am at  the present moment at the end of my resources.'  'I shall come tomorrow at this time,' he said. 'Will you be here?' 'Yes,' said I, and he left.  Next day, exactly at the appointed hour, the car drew up near our  quarters, and the horn was blown. The children came with the news.  The Sheth did not come in. I went out to see him. He placed in my  hands currency notes of the value of Rs. ,, and drove away. I had never expected this help, and what a novel way of rendering  it! The gentleman had never before visited the Ashram. So far as I  can remember, I had met him only once. No visit, no enquiries,  simply rendering help and going away! This was a unique experience  for me. The help deferred the exodus to the untouchables' quarter.  We now felt quite safe for a year.  Just as there was a storm outside so there was a storm in the Ashram  itself. Though in South Africa untouchable friends used to come to  my place and live and feed with me, my wife and other women did not  seem quite to relish the admission into the Ashram of the  untouchable friends. My eyes and ears easily detected their  indifference, if not their dislike towards Danibehn. The monetary  difficulty had caused me no anxiety, but this internal storm was  more than I could bear. Danibehn was an ordinary woman. Dudabhai was  a man with slight education but of good understanding. I liked his  patience. Sometimes he did flare up, but on the whole I was well  impressed with his forbearance. I pleaded with him to swallow minor  insults. He not only agreed, but prevailed upon his wife to do  likewise.  The admission of this family proved a valuable lesson to the Ashram.  In the very beginning we proclaimed to the world that the Ashram  would not countenance untouchability. Those who wanted to help the  Ashram were thus put on their guard, and the work of the Ashram in  this direction was considerably simplified. The fact that it is  mostly the real orthodox Hindus who have met the daily growing  expenses of the Ashram is perhaps a clear indication that  untouchability is shaken to its foundation. There are indeed many  other proofs of this, but the fact that good Hindus do not scruple  to help an Ashram where we go the length of dining with the  untouchables is no small proof.  I am sorry that I should have to skip over quite a number of things  pertaining to this subject, how we tackled delicate questions  arising out of the main question, how we had to overcome some  unexpected difficulties, and various other matters which are quite  relevant to a description of experiments with Truth. The chapters  that follow will also suffer from the same drawback. I shall have to  omit important details, because most of the characters in the drama  are still alive, and it is not proper without permission to use  their names in connection with events with which they are concerned.  It is hardly practicable to obtain their consent or to get them  every now and then to revise the chapters concerning themselves.  Besides, such procedure is outside the limit of this autobiography. I  therefore fear that the rest of the story, valuable as it in my  opinion to seekers after Truth, will be told with inevitable  omissions. Nevertheless, it is my desire and hope, God willing, to  bring this narrative down to the days of Non-co-operation.   I do not remember to have seen a handloom or a spinning wheel when in   I described it in Hind Swaraj  as the panacea for the growing pauperism of India. In that book I  took it as understood that anything that helped India to get rid of  the grinding poverty of her masses would in the same process also  establish Swaraj. Even in , when I returned to India from South  Africa, I had not actually seen a spinning wheel. When the  Satyagraha Ashram was founded at Sabarmati, we introduced a few  handlooms there. But no sooner had we done this than we found  ourselves up against a difficulty. All of us belonged either to the  liberal professions or to business; not one of us was an artisan. We  needed a weaving expert to teach us to weave before we could work  the looms. One was at last procured from Palanpur, but he did not  communicate to us the whole of his art. But Maganlal  Gandhi was not to be easily baffled. Possessed of a natural talent  for mechanics, he was able fully to master the art before long, and  one after another several new weavers were trained up in the Ashram. The object that we set before ourselves was to be able to clothe  ourselves entirely in cloth manufactured by our own hands. We  therefore forthwith discarded the use of mill-woven cloth, and all  the members of the Ashram resolved to wear hand-woven cloth made  from Indian yarn only. The adoption of this practice brought us a  world of experience. It enabled us to know, from direct contact, the  conditions of life among the weavers, the extent of their  production, the handicaps in the way of their obtaining their yarn  supply, the way in which they were being made victims of fraud, and,  lastly, their ever growing indebtedness. We were not in a position  immediately to manufacture all the cloth for our needs. The  alternative therefore was to get our cloth supply from handloom  weavers. But ready-made cloth from Indian mill-yarn was not easily  obtainable either from the cloth-dealers or from the weavers  themselves. All the fine cloth woven by the weavers was from foreign  yarn, since Indian mills did not spin fine counts. Even today the  out-turn of higher counts by Indian mills is very limited, whilst  highest counts they cannot spin at all. It was after the greatest  effort that we were at last able to find some weavers who  condescended to weave Swadeshi yarn for us, and only on condition  that the Ashram would take up all the cloth that they might produce.  By thus adopting cloth woven from mill-yarn as our wear, and  propagating it among our friends, we made ourselves voluntary agents  of the Indian spinning mills. This in its turn brought us into  contact with the mills, and enabled us to know something about their  management and their handicaps. We saw that the aim of the mills was  more and more to weave the yarn spun by them; their co-operation  with the handloom weaver was not willing, but unavoidable and  temporary. We became impatient to be able to spin our own yarn. It  was clear that, until we could do this ourselves, dependence on the  mills would remain. We did not feel that we could render any service  to the country by continuing as agents of Indian spinning mills. No end of difficulties again faced us. We could get neither spinning  wheel nor a spinner to teach us how to spin. We were employing some  wheels for filling pearns and bobbins for weaving in the Ashram. But  we had no idea that these could be used as spinning wheels. Once  Kalidas Jhaveri discovered a woman who, he said, would demonstrate  to us how spinning was done. We sent to her a member of the Ashram  who was known for his great versatility in learning new things. But  even he returned without wresting the secret of the art. So the time passed on, and my impatience grew with the time. I plied  every chance visitor to the Ashram who was likely to possess some  information about hand spinning with questions about the art. But the  art being confined to women and having been all but exterminated, if  there was some stray spinner still surviving in some obscure corner,  only a member of that sex was likely to find out her whereabouts. In the year  I was taken by my Gujarati friends to preside at  the Broach Educational Conference. It was here that I discovered  that remarkable lady Gangabehn Majmundar. She was a widow, but her  enterprising spirit knew no bounds. Her education, in the accepted  sense of the term, was not much. But in courage and commonsense she  easily surpassed the general run of our educated women. She had  already got rid of the curse of untouchability, and fearlessly moved  among and served the suppressed classes. She had means of her own,  and her needs were few. She had a well seasoned constitution, and  went about everywhere without an escort. She felt quite at home on  horseback. I came to know her more intimately at the Godhra  Conference. To her I poured out my grief about the charkha, and she  lightened my burden by a promise to prosecute an earnest and  incessant search for the spinning wheel.  I must regard my participation in Congress proceedings at Amritsar as  my real entrance into the Congress politics. My attendance at the  previous Congress was nothing more perhaps than an annual renewal of  allegiance to the Congress. I never felt on these occasions that I  had any other work cut out for me except that of a mere private, nor  did I desire more.  My experience of Amritsar had shown that there were one or two  things for which perhaps I had some aptitude and which could be  useful to the Congress. I could already see that the late Lokamanya,  the Deshabandhu, Pandit Motilalji and other leaders were pleased  with my work in connection with the Punjab inquiry. They used to  invite me to their informal gatherings where, as I found, resolutions  for the Subjects Committee were conceived. At these gatherings only  those persons were invited who enjoyed the special confidence of the  leaders and whose services were needed by them. Interlopers also  sometimes found their way to these meetings.  There were, for the coming year, two things which interested me, as  I had some aptitude for them. One of these was the memorial of the  Jalianwala Bagh Massacre. The Congress had passed a resolution for  it amid great enthusiasm. A fund of about five lakhs had to be  collected for it. I was appointed one of the trustees. Pandit  Malaviyaji enjoyed the reputation of being the prince among beggars  for the public cause. But I knew that I was not far behind him in  that respect. It was whilst I was in South Africa that I discovered  my capacity in this direction. I had not the unrivalled magic of  Malaviyaji for commanding princely donations from the potentates of  India. But I knew that there was no question of approaching the  Rajas and Maharajas for donations for the Jalianwala Bagh memorial.  The main responsibility for the collection thus fell, as I had  expected, on my shoulders. The generous citizens of Bombay  subscribed most liberally, and the memorial trust has at present a  handsome credit balance in the bank. But the problem that faces the  country today is what kind of memorial to erect on the ground, to  sanctify which, Hindus, Musalmans and Sikhs mingled their blood. The  three communities, instead of being bound in a bond of amity and  love, are to all appearance, at war with one another, and the  nation is at a loss as to how to utilize the memorial fund. My other aptitude which the Congress could utilize was as a  draftsman. The Congress leaders had found that I had a faculty for  condensed expression, which I had acquired by long practice. The  then existing constitution of the Congress was Gokhale's legacy. He  had framed a few rules which served as a basis for running the  Congress machinery. The interesting history of the framing of these  rules I had learnt form Gokhale's own lips. But everybody had now  come to feel that these rules were no longer adequate for the ever  increasing business of the Congress. The question had been coming up  year after year. The Congress at that time had practically no  machinery functioning during the interval between session and  session, or for dealing with fresh contingencies that might arise in  the course of the year. The existing rules provided for  three secretaries, but as a matter of fact only one of them was a  functioning secretary, and even he was not a whole-timer. How was  he, single-handed, to run the Congress office, to think of the  future, or to discharge during the current year the obligations  contracted by the Congress in the past? During that year, therefore,  everybody felt that this question would assume all the more  importance. The Congress was too unwieldy a body for the discussion  of public affairs. There was no limit set to the number of delegates  in the Congress or to the number of delegates that each province could  return. Some improvement upon the existing chaotic condition was  thus felt by everybody to be an imperative necessity. I undertook  the responsibility of framing a constitution on one condition. I saw  that there were two leaders, viz., the Lokamanya and the  Deshabandhu who had the greatest hold on the public. I requested  that they, as the representatives of the people, should be  associated with me on the Committee for framing the constitution.  But since it was obvious that they would not have the time  personally to participate in the constitution-making work, I  suggested that two persons enjoying their confidence should be a  appointed along with me on the Constitution Committee, and that the  number of its personnel should be limited to three. This suggestion  was accepted by the late Lokmanya and the late Deshabandhu, who suggested the names of Sjts. Kelkar and I.B. Sen  respectively as their proxies. The Constitution Committee could not  even once come together, but we were able to consult with each other  by correspondence, and in the end presented a unanimous report. I  regard this constitution with a certain measure of pride. I hold  that, if we could fully work out this constitution, the mere fact of  working it out would bring us Swaraj. With the assumption of this  responsibility I may be said to have made my real entrance into the  Congress politics.  The trial began. The Government pleader, the Magistrate and other  officials were at a loss to know what to do. The Government pleader was pressing the Magistrate to postpone  the case. But I interfered and requested the Magistrate not to  postpone the case, as I wanted to plead guilty to having disobeyed  the order to leave Champaran and read a brief statement as follows: 'With the permission of the Court I would like to make a brief  statement showing why I have taken the very serious step of  seemingly disobeying the order passed under section  of Cr. P.C.  In my humble opinion it is a question of difference of opinion  between the Local Administration and myself. I have entered the  country with motives of rendering humanitarian and national service.  I have done so in response to a pressing invitation to come and help  the ryots, who urge they are not being fairly treated by the indigo  planters. I could not render any help without studying the problem.  I have, therefore, come to study it with the assistance, if  possible, of the Administration and the planters. I have no other  motive, and cannot believe that my coming can in any way disturb  public peace and cause loss of life. I claim to have considerable  experience in such matters. The Administration, however, have  thought differently. I fully appreciate their difficulty, and I  admit too that they can only proceed upon information they received.  As a law-abiding citizen my first instinct would be, as it were, to  obey the order served upon me. But I could not do so without doing  violence to my sense of duty to those for whom I have come. I feel  that I could just now serve them only by remaining in their midst. I  could not, therefore, voluntarily retire. Amid this conflict of  duties I could only throw the responsibility of removing me from  them on the Administration. I am fully conscious of the fact that a  person, holding, in the public life of India, a position such as I  do, has to be most careful in setting an example. It is my firm  belief that in the complex constitution under which we are living,  the only safe and honourable course for a self-respecting man is, in  the circumstances such as face me, to do what I have decided to do,  that is, to submit without protest to the penalty of disobedience.  'I venture to make this statement not in any way in extenuation of  the penalty to be awarded against me, but to show that I have  disregarded the order served upon me, not for want of respect for  lawful authority, but in obedience to the higher law of our being,  the voice of conscience.'  There was now no occasion to postpone the hearing, but as both the  Magistrate and the Government pleader had been taken by surprise,  the Migistrate postponed judgment. Meanwhile I had wired full  details to the Viceroy, to Patna friends, as also to Pandit Madan  Mohan Malaviya and others.  Before I could appear before the Court to receive the sentence, the  Magistrate sent a written message that the Lieutenant Governor had  ordered the case against me to be withdrawn, and the Collector wrote  to me saying that I was at liberty to conduct the proposed inquiry,  and  that I might count on whatever help I needed from the officials.  None of us was prepared for this prompt and happy issue. I called on the Collector, Mr. Heycock. He seemed to be a good man,  anxious to do justice. He told me that I might ask for whatever  papers I desired to see, and that I was at liberty to see him  whenever I liked.  The country thus had its first direct object-lesson in Civil  Disobedience. The affair was freely discussed both locally and in  the press, and my inquiry got unexpected publicity.  It was necessary for my inquiry that the Government should remain  neutral. But the inquiry did not need support from press reporters  or leading articles in the press. Indeed the situation in Champaran  was so delicate and difficult that over-energetic criticism or  highly coloured reports might easily damage the cause which I was seeking  to espouse. So I wrote to the editors of the principal papers  requesting them not to trouble to send any reporters, as I should  send them whatever might be necessary for publication and keep them  informed.  I knew that the Government attitude countenancing my presence had  displeased the Champaran planters, and I know that even the  officials, though they could say nothing openly, could hardly have  liked it. Incorrect or misleading reports, therefore, were likely to  incense them all the more, and their ire, instead of descending on  me, would be sure to descend on the poor fear-stricken ryots and  seriously hinder my search for the truth about the case.  In spite of these precautions the planters engineered against me a  poisonous agitation. All sorts of falsehoods appeared in the press  about my co-workers and myself. But my extreme cautiousness and my  insistence on truth, even to the minutest detail, turned the edge of  their sword.  The planters left no stone unturned in maligning Brajkishorebabu,  but the more they maligned him, the more he rose in the estimation  of the people.  In such a delicate situation as this I did not think it proper to  invite any leaders from other provinces. Pandit Malaviyaji had sent  me an assurance that, whenever I wanted him, I had only to send him  word, but I did not trouble him. I thus prevented the struggle from  assuming a political aspect. But I sent to the leaders and the  principal papers occasional reports, not for publication, but merely  for their information. I had seen that, even where the end might be  political, but where the cause was non-political, one damaged it by  giving it a political aspect and helped it by keeping it within its  non-political limit. The Champaran struggle was a proof of the fact  that disinterested service of the people in any sphere ultimately  helps the country politically.  My object was to inquire into the condition of the Champaran  agriculturists and understand their grievances against the indigo  planters. For this purpose it was necessary that I should meet  thousands of the ryots. But I deemed it essential, before starting  on my inquiry, to know the planters' side of the case and see the  Commissioner of the Division. I sought and was granted appointments  with both.  The Secretary of the Planters' Association told me  plainly that I was an outsider and that I had no business to come  between the planters and their tenants, but if I had any  representation to make, I might submit it in writing. I politely  told him that I did not regard myself as an outsider, and that I had  every right to inquire into the condition of the tenants if they  desired me to do so.  The Commissioner, on whom I called, proceeded to bully me, and  advised me forthwith to leave Tirhut. I acquainted my co-workers with all this, and told them that there  was a likelihood of Government stopping me from proceeding further,  and that I might have to go to jail earlier than I had expected, and  that, if I was to be arrested, it would be best that the arrest  should take place in Motihari or if possible in Bettiah. It was  advisable, therefore, that I should go to those place as early as  possible.  Champaran is a district of the Tirhut division and Motihari is its  headquarters. Rajkumar Shukla's place was in the vicinity of Bettiah,  and the tenants belonging to the kothis in its neighbourhood were  the poorest in the district. Rajkumar Shukla wanted me to see them  and I was equally anxious to do so.  So I started with my co-workers for Motihari the same day. Babu  Gorakh Prasad harboured us in his home, which became a caravanserai.  It could hardly contain us all. The very same day we heard that  about five miles from Motihari a tenant had been ill-treated. It was  decided that, in company with Babu Dharanidhar Prasad, I should go  and see him the next morning, and we accordingly set off for the  place on elephant's back. An elephant, by the way, is about as  common in Champaran as a bullock-cart in Gujarat. We had scarcely  gone half when a messenger from the Police Superintendent overtook  us and said that the latter had sent his compliments. I saw what he  meant. Having left Dharanidharbabu to proceed to the original  destination, I got into the hired carriage which the messenger had  brought. He then served on me a notice to leave Champaran, and drove  me to my place. On his asking me to acknowledge the service of the  notice, I wrote to the effect that I did not propose to comply with  it and leave Champaran till my inquiry was finished. Thereupon I  received a summons to take my trial the next day for disobeying the  order to leave Champaran.  I kept awake that whole night writing letters and giving necessary  instructions to Babu Brajkishore Prasad.  The news of the notice and the summons spread like wildfire, and I  was told that Motihari that day witnessed unprecedented scenes.  Gorakhbabu's house and the court house overflowed with men.  Fortunately I had finished all my work during the night and so was  able to cope with the crowds. My companions proved the greatest help.  They occupied themselves with regulating the crowds, for the latter  followed me wherever I went.  A sort of friendliness sprang up between the officials \u2013 Collector,  Magistrate, Police Superintendent \u2013 and myself. I might have legally  resisted the notices served on me. Instead I accepted them all, and  my conduct towards the officials was correct. They thus saw that I  did not want to offend them personally, but that I wanted to offer  civil resistance to their orders. In this way they were put at ease,  and instead of harassing me they gladly availed themselves of my and  my co-workers' co-operation in regulating the crowds. But it was an  ocular demonstration to them of the fact that their authority was  shaken. The people had for the moment lost all fear of punishment  and yielded obedience to the power of love which their new friend  exercised.  It should be remembered that no one knew me in Champaran. The  peasants were all ignorant. Champaran, being far up north of the  Ganges, and right at the foot of the Himalayas in close proximity to  Nepal, was cut off from the rest of India. The Congress was  practically unknown in those parts. Even those who had heard the  name of the Congress shrank from joining it or even mentioning it.  And now the Congress and its members had entered this land, though  not in the name of the Congress, yet in a far more real sense.   In consultation with my co-workers I had decided that nothing should  be done in the name of the Congress. What we wanted was work and not  name, substance and not shadow. For the name of the Congress was the  b\u00eate noire of the Government and their controllers \u2013 the planters.  To them the Congress was a byword for lawyers' wrangles, evasion of  law through legal loopholes, a byword for bomb and anarchical crime  and for diplomacy and hypocrisy. We had to disillusion them both.  Therefore we had decided not to mention the name of the Congress and  not to acquaint the peasants with the organization  called the Congress. It was enough, we thought, if they understood  and followed the spirit of the Congress instead of its letter.  No emissaries had therefore been sent there, openly or secretly, on  behalf of the Congress to prepare the ground for our arrival.  Rajkumar Shukla was incapable of reaching the thousands of peasants.  No political work had yet been done amongst them. The world outside  Champaran was not known to them. And yet they received me as though  we had been age-long friends. It is no exaggeration, but the literal  truth, to say that in this meeting with the peasants I was face to  face with God, Ahimsa and Truth.  When I come to examine my title to this realization, I find nothing  but my love for the people. And this in turn is nothing but an  expression of my unshakable faith in Ahimsa.  That day in Champaran was an unforgettable event in my life and a  red-letter day for the peasants and for me.  According to the law, I was to be on my trial, but truly speaking  Government was to be on its trial. The Commissioner only succeeded  in trapping Government in the net which he had spread for me.  Brajkishorebabu and Rajendrababu were a matchless pair. Their devotion made it  impossible for me to take a single step without their help. Their  disciples, or their companions \u2013 Shambhaubabu, Anugrahababu,  Dharanibabu, Ramnavmibabu and other vakils \u2013 were always with us.  Vindhyababu and Janakdharibabu also came and helped us now and then.  All these were Biharis. Their principal work was to take down the  ryots' statements.  Professor Kripalani could not but cast in his lot with us. Though a  Sindhi he was more Bihari than a born Bihari. I have seen only a few  workers capable of merging themselves in the province of their  adoption. Kripalani is one of those few. He made it impossible for  anyone to feel that he belonged to a different province. He was my  gatekeeper in chief. For the time being he made it the end and aim of  his life to save me from darshan - seekers. He warded off people, calling to his aid now his unfailing  humour, now his non-violent threats. At nightfall he would take up  his occupation of a teacher and regale his companions with his  historical studies and observations, and quicken any timid visitor  into bravery.  Maulana Mazharul Haq had registered his name on the standing list of  helpers whom I might count upon whenever necessary, and he made a  point of looking in once or twice a month. The pomp and splendour in  which he then lived was in sharp contrast to his simple life of  today. The way in which he associated with us made us feel that he  was one of us, though his fashionable habit gave a stranger a  different impression.  As I gained more experience of Bihar, I became convinced that work  of a permanent nature was impossible without proper village  education. The ryots' ignorance was pathetic. They either allowed  their children to roam about, or made them toil on indigo  plantations from morning to night for a couple of coppers a day. In  those days a male labourer's wage did not exceed ten pice, a  female's did not exceed six, and a child's three. He who succeeded  in earning four annas a day was considered most fortunate. In consultation with my companions I decided to open primary schools  in six villages. One of our conditions with the villagers was that  they should provide the teachers with board and lodging while we  would see to the other expenses. The village folk had hardly any  cash in their hands, but they could well afford to provide  foodstuffs. Indeed they had already expressed their readiness to  contribute grain and other raw materials.  From where to get the teachers was a great problem. It was difficult  to find local teachers who would work for a bare allowance or  without remuneration. My idea was never to entrust children to  commonplace teachers. Their literary qualification was not so  essential as their moral fibre.  So I issued a public appeal for voluntary teachers. It received a  ready response. Sjt. Gangadharrao Deshpande sent Babasaheb Soman and  Pundalik. Shrimati Avantikabai Gokhale came from Bombay and Mrs.  Anandibai Vaishampayan from Poona. I sent to the Ashram for  Chhotalal, Surendranath and my son Devdas. About this time Mahadev  Desai and Narahari Parikh with their wives cast in their lot with  me. Kasturbai was also summoned for the work. This was a fairly  strong contingent. Shrimati Avantikabai and Shrimati Anandibai were  educated enough, but Shrimati Durga Desai and Shrimati Manibehn  Parikh had nothing more than a bare knowledge of Gujarati, and  Kasturbai not even that. How were these ladies to instruct the  children in Hindi?  I explained to them they were expected to teach the children not  grammar and the three R's so much as cleanliness and good manners. I  further explained that even as regards letters there was not so  great a difference between Gujarati, Hindi and Marathi as they  imagined, and in the primary classes, at any rate, the teaching of  the rudiments of the alphabet and numerals was not a difficult  matter. The result was that the classes taken by these ladies were  found to be most successful. The experience inspired them with  confidence and interest in their work. Avantikabai's became a model  school. She threw herself heart and soul into her work. She brought  her exceptional gifts to bear on it. Through these ladies we could,  to some extent, reach the village women.  But I did not want to stop at providing for primary education. The  villages were insanitary, the lanes full of filth, the wells  surrounded by mud and stink and the courtyards unbearably untidy.  The elder people badly needed education in cleanliness. They were  all suffering from various skin diseases. So it was decided to do as  much sanitary work as possible and to penetrate every department of  their lives.  Doctors were needed for this work. I requested the Servants of India  Society to lend us the services of the late Dr. Dev. We had been  great friends, and he readily offered his services for six months.  The teachers \u2013 men and women \u2013 had all to work under him.  All of them had express instructions not to concern themselves with  grievances against planters or with politics. People who had any  complaints to make were to be referred to me. No one was to venture  out of his beat. The friends carried out these instructions with  wonderful fidelity. I do not remember a single occasion of  indiscipline.  To give a full account of the Champaran inquiry would be to narrate the  histroy, for the period, of the Champaran ryot, which is out of the  question in these chapters. The Champaran inquiry was a bold  experiment with Truth and Ahimsa, and I am giving week by week only  what occurs to me as worth giving from that point of view. For more  details the reader must turn to Sjt. Rajendra Prasad's history of  the Champaran Satyagraha in Hindi, of which, I am told, an English  edition is now in the press.  But to return to the subject matter of this chapter. The inquiry  could not be conducted in Gorakhbabu's house, without practically  asking poor Gorakhbabu to vacate it. And the people of Motihari had  not yet shed their fear to the extent of renting a house to us.  However, Brajkishorebabu tactfully secured one with considerable  open space about it, and we now removed there.  It was not quite possible to carry on the work without money. It had  not been the practice hitherto to appeal to the public for money for  work of this kind. Brajkishorebabu and his friends were mainly  vakils who either contributed funds themselves, or found it from  friends whenever there was an occasion. How could they ask the  people to pay when they and their kind could well afford to do so?  That seemed to be the argument. I had made up my mind not to accept  anything from the Champaran ryots. It would be bound to be  misinterpreted. I was equally determined not to appeal to the  country at large for funds to conduct this inquiry. For that was  likely to give it an all-India and political aspect. Friends from  Bombay offered Rs. ,, but I declined the offer with thanks. I  decided to get as much as was possible, with Brajkishorebabu's help,  from well-to-do Biharis living outside Champaran and, if more was  needed, to approach my friend Dr. P.J. Mehta of Rangoon. Dr. Mehta  readily agreed to send me whatever might be needed. We were thus  free from all anxiety on this score. We were not likely to require  large funds, as we were bent on exercising the greatest economy in  consonance with the poverty of Champaran. Indeed it\u00a0 was found  in the end that we did not need any large amount. I have an  impression that we expended in all not more than three thousand  rupees, and, as far as I remember, we saved a few hundred rupees  from what we had collected.  The curious ways of living of my companions in the early days were a  constant theme of raillery at their expense. Each of the vakils had  a servant and a cook, and therefore a separate kitchen, and they  often had their dinner as late as midnight. Though they paid their  own expenses, their irregularity worried me, but as we had become  close friends there was no possibility of a misunderstanding between  us, and they received my ridicule in good part. Ultimately it was  agreed that the servants should be dispensed with, that all the  kitchens should be amalgamated, and that regular hours should be  observed. As all were not vegetarians, and as two kitchens would  have been expensive, a common vegetarian kitchen was decided upon.  It was also felt necessary to insist on simple meals.  These arrangements considerably reduced the expenses and saved us a  lot of time and energy, and both these were badly needed. Crowds of  peasants came to make their statements, and they were followed by an  army of companions who filled the compound and garden to  overflowing. The efforts of my companions to save me from darshan-seekers  were often of no avail, and I had to be exhibited for darshan  at particular hours. At least five to seven volunteers were required  to take down statements, and even then some people had to go away in  the evening without being able to make their statements. All these  statements were not essential, many of them being repetitions, but  the people could not be satisfied otherwise, and I appreciated their  feeling in the matter.  Those who took down the statements had to observe certain rules.  Each peasant had to be closely cross-examined, and whoever failed to  satisfy the test was rejected. This entailed a lot of extra time but  most of the statements were thus rendered incontrovertible.  An officer from the C.I.D. would always be present when these  statements were recorded. We might have prevented him, but we had  decided from the very beginning not only not to mind the presence of  C.I.D. officers, but to treat them with courtesy and to give them  all the information that it was possible to give them. This was far  from doing us any harm. On the contrary the very fact that the  statements were taken down in the presence of the C.I.D. officers  made the peasants more fearless. Whilst on the one hand excessive  fear of the C.I.D. was driven out of the peasants' minds, on the  other, their presence exercised a natural restraint on exaggeration.  It was the business of C.I.D. friends to entrap people and so the  peasants had necessarily to be cautious.  As I did not want to irritate the planters, but to win them over by  gentleness, I made a point of writing to and meeting such of them  against whom allegations of a serious nature were made. I met the  Planters' Association as well, placed the ryots' grievances before  them and acquainted myself with their point of view. Some of the  planters hated me, some were indifferent and a few treated me with  courtesy. Whilst on the one hand social service work of the kind I have described in  the foregoing chapters was being carried out, on the other the work  of recording statements of the ryots' grievances was progressing  apace. Thousands of such statements were taken, and they could not  but have their effect. The ever growing number of ryots coming to  make their statements increased the planters' wrath, and they moved  heaven and earth to counteract my inquiry.  One day I received a letter from the Bihar Government to the  following effect: 'Your inquiry has been sufficiently prolonged;  should you not now bring it to an end and leave Bihar?' The letter  was couched in polite language, but its meaning was obvious.  I wrote in reply that the inquiry was bound to be prolonged, and  unless and until it resulted in bringing relief to the people, I had  no intention of leaving Bihar, I pointed out that it was open to  Government to terminate my inquiry by accepting the ryots'  grievances as genuine and redressing them, or by recognizing that  the ryots had made out a prima facie case for an official inquiry  which should be immediately instituted.  Sir Edward Gait, the Lieutenant Governor, asked me to see him,  expressed his willingness to appoint an inquiry and invited me to be  a member of the Committee. I ascertained the names of the other  members, and after consultation with my co-workers agreed to serve  on the Committee, on condition that I should be free to confer with  my co-workers during the progress of the inquiry, that Government  should recognize that, by being a member of the Committee, I did not  cease to be the ryots' advocate, and that in case the result of the  inquiry failed to give me satisfaction, I should be free to guide  and advise the ryots as to what line of action they should take.  Sir Edward Gait accepted the condition as just and proper and  announced the inquiry. The late Sir Frank Sly was appointed Chairman  of the Committee.  The Committee found in favour of the ryots, and recommended that the  planters should refund a portion of the exactions made by them which  the Committee had found to be unlawful, and that the tinkathia  system should be abolished by law.  Sir Edward Gait had a large share in getting the Committee to make a  unanimous report and in getting the agrarian bill passed in  accordance with the Committee's recommendations. Had he not adopted  a firm attitude, and had he not brought all his tact to bear on the  subject, the report would not have been unanimous, and the Agrarian  Act would not have been passed. The planters wielded extraordinary  power. They offered strenuous opposition to the bill in spite of the  report, but Sir Edwin Gait remained firm up to the last and fully  carried out the recommendations of the Committee.  The tinkathia  system which had been in existence for about a century was thus  abolished, and with it the planters' raj came to an end. The ryots,  who had all along remained crushed, now somewhat came to their own,  and the superstition that the stain of indigo could never be washed  out was exploded.  It was my desire to continue the constructive work for some years,  to establish more schools and to penetrate the villages more  effectively. The ground had been prepared, but it did not please  God, as often before, to allow my plans to be fulfilled. Fate  decided otherwise and drove me to take up work elsewhere.  As far as was possible we placed each school in charge of one man and  one woman. These volunteers had to look after medical relief and  sanitation. The womenfolk had to be approached through women.  Medical relief was a very simple affair. Castor oil, quinine and  sulphur ointment were the only drugs provided to the volunteers. If  the patient showed a furred tongue or complained of constipation,  castor oil was administered, in case of fever quinine was given  after an opening dose of castor oil, and the sulphur ointment was  applied in case of boils and itch after thoroughly washing the  affected parts. No patient was permitted to take home any medicine.  Wherever there was some complication Dr. Dev was consulted. Dr. Dev used to visit each  centre on certain fixed days in the week.  Quite a number of people availed themselves of this simple relief.  This plan of work will not seem strange when it is remembered that  the prevailing ailments were few and amenable to simple treatment,  by no means requiring expert help. As for the people the arrangement  answered excellently.  Sanitation was a difficult affair. The people were not prepared to  do anything themselves. Even the field labourers were not ready to  do their own scavenging. But Dr. Dev was not a man easily to lose  heart. He and the volunteers concentrated their energies on making a  village ideally clean. They swept the roads and the courtyards,  cleaned out the wells, filled up the pools near by, and lovingly  persuaded the villagers to raise volunteers from amongst  themselves. In some villages they shamed people into taking up the  work, and in others the people were so enthusiastic that they even  prepared roads to enable my car to go from place to place. These  sweet experiences were not unmixed with bitter ones of people's  apathy. I remember some villagers frankly expressing their dislike  for this work.  It may not be out of place here to narrate an experience that I have  described before now at many meetings. Bhitiharva was a small  village in which was one of our schools. I happened to visit a  smaller village in its vicinity and found some of the women dressed  very dirtily. So I told my wife to ask them why they did not wash  their clothes. She spoke to them. One of the women took her into her  hut and said: 'Look now, there is no box or cupboard here containing  other clothes. The sari I am wearing is the only one I have. How  am I to wash it? Tell Mahatmaji to get me another sari, and I  shall then promise to bathe and put on clean clothes every day.'  This cottage was not an exception, but a type to be found in many  Indian villages. In countless cottages in India people live without  any furniture, and without a change of clothes, merely with a rag to  cover their shame.  One more experience I will note. In Champaran there is no lack of  bamboo and grass. The school hut they had put up at Bhitiharva was  made of these materials. Someone \u2013 possibly some of the neighbouring  planters' men \u2013 set fire to it one night. It was not thought advisable  to build another hut of bamboo and grass. The school was in charge  of Sjt. Soman and Kasturbai. Sjt. Soman decided to build a pukka  house, and thanks to his infectious labour, many co-operated with  him, and a brick house was soon made ready. There was no fear now of  this building being burnt down.  Thus the volunteers with their schools, sanitation work and medical  relief gained the confidence and respect of the village folk, and  were able to bring good influence to bear upon them.  But I must  confess with regret that my hope of putting this constructive work  on a permanent footing was not fulfilled. The volunteers had come  for temporary periods, I could not secure any more from outside, and  permanent honorary workers from Bihar were not available. As soon as  my work in Champaran was finished, work outside, which had been  preparing in the meantime, drew me away. The few months' work in  Champaran, however, took such deep root that its influence in one  form or another is to be observed there even today.  The Punjab Government could not keep in confinement the hundreds of  Punjabis who, under the martial law regime, had been clapped into  jail on the strength of the most meagre evidence by tribunals that  were courts only in name. There was such an outcry all round against  this flagrant piece of injustice that their further incarceration  became imposible. Most of the prisoners were released before the  Congress opened. Lala Harkishanlal and the other leaders were all  released, while the session of the Congress was still in progress.  The Ali Brothers too arrived there straight from jail. The people's  joy knew no bounds. Pandit Motilal Nehru, who, at the sacrifice of  his splendid practice, had made the Punjab his headquarters and had  done great service, was the President of the Congress; the late  Swami Shraddhanandji was the Chairman of the Reception Committee. Up to this time my share in the annual proceedings of the Congress was  confined only to the constructive advocacy of Hindi by making my  speech in the national language, and to presenting in that speech the  case of the Indians overseas. Nor did I expect to be called upon to  do anything more this year. But, as had happened on many a previous  occasion, responsible work came to me all of a sudden. The King's announcement on the new reforms had just been issued. It  was not wholly satisfactory even to me, and was unsatisfactory to  everyone else. But I felt at that time that the reforms, though  defective, could still be accepted. I felt in the King's  announcement and its language the hand of Lord Sinha, and it lent a  ray of hope. But experienced stalwarts like the late Lokamanya and  Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das shook their heads. Pandit Malaviyaji  was neutral.  Pandit Malaviyaji had harboured me in his own room. I had a glimpse  of the simplicity of his life on the occasion of the foundation  ceremony of the Hindu University; but on this occasion, being in the  same room with him, I was able to observe his daily routine in the  closest detail, and what I saw filled me with joyful surprise. His  room presented the appearance of a free inn for all the poor. You  could hardly cross from one end to the other. It was so crowded. It  was accessible at all odd hours to chance visitors who had the  licence to take as much of his time as they liked. In a corner of  this crib lay my charpai in all its dignity.  But I may not occupy this chapter with a description of Malaviyaji's  mode of living, and must return to my subject.  I was thus enabled to  hold daily discussions with Malaviyaji, who used lovingly to explain  to me, like an elder brother, the various view-points of the  different parties. I saw that my participation in the deliberations  on the resolution on the reforms was inevitable. Having had my share  of responsibility in the drawing up of the Congress report on the  Punjab wrongs, I felt that all that still remained to be done in  that connection must claim my attention. There had to be dealings  with Government in that matter. Then similarly there was the  Khilafat question. I further believed at that time that Mr. Montagu  would not betray or allow India's cause to be betrayed. The release  of the Ali Brothers and other prisoners too seemed to me to be an  auspicious sign. In these circumstances I felt that a resolution not  rejecting but accepting the reforms was the correct thing.  Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das, on the other hand, held firmly to the  view that the reforms ought to be rejected as wholly inadequate and  unsatisfactory. The late Lokamanya was more or less neutral, but had  decided to throw in his weight on the side of any resolution that  the Deshabandhu might approve.  The idea of having to differ from such seasoned, well tried and  universally revered leaders was unbearable to me. But on the other  hand the voice of conscience was clear. I tried to run away from the  Congress and suggested to Pandit Malaviyaji and Motilalji that it  would be in the general interest if I absented myself from the  Congress for the rest of the session. It would save me from having  to make an exhibition of my difference with such esteemed leaders. But my suggestion found no favour with these two seniors. The news  of my proposal was somehow whispered to Lala Harkishanlal. 'This  will never do. It will very much hurt the feelings of the Punjabis,'  he said. I discussed the matter with Lokamanya, Deshabandhu and Mr.  Jinnah, but no way out could be found. Finally I laid bare my  distress to Malaviyaji. 'I see no prospect of a compromise,' I told  him, 'and if I am to move my resolution, a division will have to be  called and votes taken. But I do not find here any arrangements for  it. The practice in the open session of the Congress so far has been  to take votes by a show of hands with the result that all  distinction between visitors and delegates is lost, while, as for  taking a count of votes in such vast assemblies, we have no means at  all. So it comes to this that, even if I want to call a division,  there will be no facility for it, nor meaning in it.' But Lala  Harkishanlal came to the rescue and undertook to make the necessary  arrangements. 'We will not,' he said, 'permit visitors in the  Congress pandal on the day on which voting is to take place. And as  for taking the count, well, I shall see to that. But you must not  absent yourself from the Congress.'  I capitulated; I framed my  resolution, and in heart trembling undertook to move it. Pandit  Malaviyaji and Mr. Jinnah were to support it. I could notice that,  although our difference of opinion was free from any trace of  bitterness, and although our speeches too contained nothing but cold  reasoning, the people could not stand the very fact of a difference;  it pained them. They wanted unanimity.  Even while speeches were being delivered, efforts to settle the  difference were being made on the platform, and notes were being  freely exchanged among the leaders for that purpose. Malaviyaji was  leaving no stone unturned to bridge the gulf. Just then Jeramdas  handed over his amendment to me and pleaded in his own sweet manner  to save the delegates from the dilemma of a division. His amendment  appealed to me. Malaviyaji's eye was already scanning every quarter  for a ray of hope. I told him that Jeramdas's amendment seemed to me  to be likely to be acceptable to both the parties. The Lokamanya, to  whom it was next shown, said, 'If C.R. Das approves, I will have no  objection.' Deshabandhu at last thawed, and cast a look towards Sjt.  Bepin Chandra Pal for endorsement. Malaviyaji was filled with hope.  He snatched away the slip of paper containing the amendment, and  before Deshabandhu had even pronounced a definite 'yes', shouted  out, 'Brother delegates, you will be glad to learn that a compromise  had been reached.' What followed beggars description. The pandal was  rent with the clapping of hands, and the erstwhile gloomy faces of  the audience lit up with joy.  It is hardly necessary to deal with the text of the amendment. My  object here is only to describe how this resolution was undertaken  as part of my experiments with which these chapters deal. The compromise further increased my responsibility.  We must now leave, for the time being, these dark happenings in the Punjab.  The Congress inquiry into Dyerism in the Punjab had just commenced,  when I received a letter of invitation to be present at a joint  conference of Hindus and Musalmans that was to meet at Delhi to  deliberate on the Khilafat question. Among the signatories to it  were the late Hakim Ajmal Khan Saheb and Mr. Asaf Ali. The late  Swami Shraddhanandji, it was stated, would be attending and, if I  remember aright, he was to be the vice-president of the conference,  which, so far as I can recollect, was to be held in the November of  that year. The Conference was to deliberate on the situation arising  out of the Khilafat betrayal, and on the question as to whether the  Hindus and Musalmans should take any part in the peace celebrations.  The letter of invitation went on to say, among other things, that  not only the Khilafat question but the question of cow protection as  well would be discussed at the conference, and it would, therefore,  afford a golden opportunity for a settlement of the cow question. I did  not like this reference to the cow question. In my letter in reply  to the invitation, therefore, whilst promising to do my best to  attend, I suggested that the two questions should not be mixed up  together or considered in the spirit of a bargain, but should be  decided on their own merits and treated separately.  With these thoughts filling my mind, I went to the conference. It  was a very well attended gathering, though it did not present the  spectacle of later gatherings that were attended by tens of  thousands. I discussed the question referred to above with the late  Swami Shraddhanandji, who was present at the conference. He  appreciated my argument and left it to me to place it before the  conference. I likewise discussed it with the late Hakim Saheb.  Before the conference I contended that, if the Khilafat question had  a just and legitimate basis, as I believe it had, and if the  Government had really committed a gross injustice, the Hindus were  bound to stand by the Musalmans in their demand for the redress of  the Khilafat wrong. It would ill become them to bring in the cow  question in this connection, or to use the occasion to make terms  with the Musalmans, just as it would ill become the Musalmans to  offer to stop cow slaughter as a price for the Hindus' support on  the Khilafat question. But it would be another matter and quite  graceful, and reflect great credit on them, if the Musalmans of  their own free will stopped cow slaughter out of regard for the  religious sentiments of the Hindus, and from a sense of duty towards  them as neighbours and children of the same soil. To take up such an  independent attitude was, I contended, their duty, and would enhance  the dignity of their conduct. But if the Musalmans considered it as  their neighbourly duty to stop cow slaughter, they should do so  regardless of whether the Hindus helped them in the Khilafat or not.  'That being so,' I argued, 'the two questions should be discussed  independently of each other, and the deliberations of the conference  should be confined to the question of the Khilafat only.' My  argument appealed to those present and, as a result, the question of  cow protection was not discussed at this conference.  But in spite of my warning Maulana Abdul Bari Saheb said: 'No matter  whether the Hindus help us or not, the Musalmans ought, as the  countrymen of the Hindus, out of regard for the latter's  susceptibilities, to give up cow slaughter.' And at one time it  almost looked as if they would really put an end to it. There was a suggestion from some quarters that the Punjab question  should be tacked on to that of the Khilafat wrong. I opposed the  proposal. The Punjab question, I said, was a local affair and could  not therefore weigh with us in our decision to participate or not in  the peace celebrations. If we mixed up the local question with the  Khilafat question, which arose directly out of the peace terms, we  should be guilty of a serious indiscretion. My argument easily  carried conviction.  Maulana Hasrat Mohani was present in this meeting. I had known him  even before, but it was only here that I discovered what a fighter  he was. We differed from each other almost from the very beginning,  and in several matters the differences have persisted. Among the numerous resolutions that were passed at this conference,  one called upon both Hindus and Musalmans to take the Swadeshi vow,  and as a natural corollary to it, to boycott foreign goods. Khadi  had not as yet found its proper place. This was not a resolution  that Hasrat Saheb would accept. His object was to wreak vengeance on  the British Empire in case justice was denied in the matter of the  Khilafat. Accordingly, he brought in a counter proposal  for the boycott purely of British goods so far as practicable. I  opposed it on the score of principle, as also of practicability,  adducing for it those arguments that have now become pretty  familiar. I also put before the conference my view-point of  non-violence. I noticed that my arguments made a deep impression on  the audience. Before me, Hasrat Mohani's speech had been received  with such loud acclamations that I was afraid that mine would only  be a cry in the wilderness. I had made bold to speak only because I  felt it would be a dereliction of duty not to lay my views before  the conference. But, to my agreeable surprise, my speech was  followed with the closest attention by those present, and evoked a  full measure of support among those on the platform, and speaker  after speaker rose to deliver speeches in support of my views. The  leaders were able to see that not only would the boycott of British  goods fail of its purpose, but would, if adopted, make of them a  laughing stock. There was hardly a man present in that assembly but  had some article of British manufacture on his person. Many of the  audience therefore realized that nothing but harm could result from  adopting a resolution that even those who voted for it were unable  to carry out.  'Mere boycott of foreign cloth cannot satisfy us, for who knows long  it will be, before we shall be able to manufacture Swadeshi cloth in  sufficient quantity for our needs, and before we can bring about  effective boycott of foreign cloth? We want something that will  produce an immediate effect on the British. Let your boycott of  foreign cloth stand, we do not mind it, but give us something  quicker, and speedier in addition' \u2013 so spoke in effect Maulana  Hasrat Mohani. Even as I was listening to him, I felt that something  new, over and above boycott of foreign cloth, would be necessary. An  immediate boycott of foreign cloth seemed to me also to be a clear  impossibility at that time. I did not then know that we could, if we  liked, produce enough khadi for all our clothing requirements; this  was only a later discovery. On the other hand, I knew even then  that, if we depended on the mills alone for effecting the boycott of  foreign cloth, we should be betrayed. I was still in the middle of  this dilemma when the Maulana concluded his speech.  I was  handicapped for want of suitable Hindi or Urdu words. This was my  first occasion for delivering an argumentative speech before an  audience especially composed of Musalmans of the North. I had spoken  in Urdu at the Muslim League at Calcutta, but it was only for a few  minutes, and the speech was intended only to be a feeling appeal to  the audience. Here, on the contrary, I was faced with a critical, if  not hostile audience, to whom I had to explain and bring home my  viewpoint. But I had cast aside all shyness. I was not there to  deliver an address in the faultless, polished Urdu of the Delhi  Muslims, but to place before the gathering my views in such broken  Hindi as I could command. And in this I was successful. This meeting  afforded me a direct proof of the fact that Hindi-Urdu alone could  become the lingua franca of India. Had I spoken in English, I  could not have produced the impression that I did on the audience,  and the Maulana might not have felt called upon to deliver his  challenge. Nor, if he had delivered it, could I have taken it up  effectively.  I could not hit upon a suitable Hindi or Urdu word for the new idea,  and that put me out somewhat. At last I described it by the word  'non-co-operation,' an expression that I used for the first time at  this meeting. As the Maulana was delivering his speech, it seemed to  me that it was vain for him to talk about effective resistance to a  Government with which he was co-operating in more than one thing, if  resort to arms was impossible or undesirable. The only true  resistance to the Government, it therefore seemed to me, was to  cease to co-operate with it. Thus I arrived at the word  non-co-operation. I had not then a clear idea of all its manifold  implications. I therefore did not enter into details. I simply said:  'The Musalmans have adopted a very important resolution. If the  peace terms are unfavourable to them \u2013 which may God forbid  \u2013  they will stop all co-operation with Government. It is an inalienable  right of the people thus to withhold co-operation. We are not bound  to retain Government titles and honours, or to continue in  Government service. If Government should betray us in a great cause  like the Khilafat, we could not do otherwise than non-co-operate. We  are therefore entitled to non-co-operate with Government in case of  a betrayal.'  But months elapsed before the word non-co-operation became current  coin. For the time being it was lost in the proceedings of the  conference. Indeed when I supported the co-operation resolution at  the Congress which met at Amritsar a month later, I did so in the  hope that the betrayal would never come.  Sir Michael O'Dwyer held me responsible for all that had happened in the  Punjab, and some irate young Punjabis held me responsible for the  martial law. They asserted that, if only I had not suspended civil  disobedience, there would have been no Jalianwala Bagh massacre.  Some of them even went the length of threatening me with  assassination if I went to the Punjab. But I felt that my position was so correct and above question that  no intelligent person could misunderstand it. I was impatient to go to the Punjab. I had never been there before,  and that made me all the more anxious to see things for myself. Dr.  Satyapal, Dr. Kitchlu and Pandit Rambhaj Dutt Chowdhari, who had  invited me to the Punjab, were at this time in jail. But I felt sure  that the Government could not dare to keep them and the other  prisoners in prison for long. A large number of Punjabis used to  come and see me whenever I was in Bombay. I ministered to them a  word of cheer on these occasions, and that would comfort them. My  self-confidence of that time was infectious. But my going to the Punjab had to be postponed again and again. The  Viceroy would say, 'not yet,' every time I asked for permission to  go there, and so the thing dragged on. In the meantime the Hunter Committee was announced to hold an  inquiry in connection with the Punjab Government's doings under the  martial law. Mr. C. F. Andrews had now reached the Punjab. His  letters gave a heart-rending description of the state of things  there, and I formed the impression that the martial law  atrocities were in fact even worse than the press reports had  showed. He pressed me urgently to come and join him. At the same  time Malaviyaji sent telegrams asking me to proceed to the Punjab at  once. I once more telegraphed to the Viceroy asking whether I could  now go to the Punjab. He wired back in reply that I could go there  after a certain date. I cannot exactly recollect now, but I think it  was th of October. The scene that I witnessed on my arrival at Lahore can never be  effaced from my memory. The railway station was from end to end one  seething mass of humanity. The entire populace had turned out of  doors in eager expectation, as if to meet a dear relation after a  long separation, and was delirious with joy. I was put up at the  late Pandit Rambhaj Dutt's bungalow, and the burden of entertaining  me fell on the shoulders of Shrimati Sarala Devi. A burden it truly  was, for even then, as now, the place where I was accommodated  became a veritable caravanserai. Owing to the principal Punjab leaders being in jail, their place, I  found, had been properly taken up by Pandit Malaviyaji, Pandit  Motilalji and the late Swami Sharddhanandji. Malaviyaji and  Shraddhanandji I had known intimately before, but this was the first  occasion on which I came in close personal contact with Motilalji.  All these leaders, as also such local leaders as had escaped the  privilege of going to jail, at once made me feel perfectly at home  amongst them, so that I never felt like a stranger in their midst. How we unanimously decided not to lead evidence before the Hunter  Committee is now a matter of history. The reasons for that decision  were published at that time, and need not be recapitulated here.  Suffice it to say that looking back upon these events from this  distance of time, I still feel that our decision to boycott the  Committee was absolutely correct and proper. As a logical consequence of the boycott of the Hunter Committee, it  was decided to appoint a non-official Inquiry Committee, to hold  almost a parallel inquiry on behalf of the Congress. Pandit Motilal  Nehru, the late Deshbandhu C. R. Das, Sjt. Abbas Tyebji, Sjt.  M.R. Jayakar and myself were appointed to this Committee, virtually  by Pandit Malaviyaji. We distributed ourselves over various places  for purposes of inquiry. The responsibility for organizing the work  of the Committee devolved on me, and as the privilege of conducting  the inquiry in the largest number of places fell to my lot, I got a  rare opportunity of observing at close quarters the people of the  Punjab and the Punjab villages. In the course of my inquiry I made acquaintance with the women of  the Punjab also. It was as if we had known one another for ages.  Wherever I went they came flocking, and laid before me their heaps  of yarn. My work in connection with the inquiry brought home to me  the fact that the Punjab could become a great field for khadi work. As I proceeded further and further with my inquiry into the  atrocities that had been committed on the people, I came across  tales of Government's tyranny and the arbitrary despotism of its  officers such as I was hardly prepared for, and they filled me with  deep pain. What surprised me then, and what still continues to fill  me with surprise, was the fact that a province that had furnished  the largest number of soldiers to the British Government during the  war, should have taken all these brutal excesses lying down. The task of drafting the report of this Committee was also entrusted  to me. I would recommend a perusal of this report to anyone who  wants to have an idea of the kind of atrocities that were  perpetrated on the Punjab people. All that I wish to say here about  it is that there is not a single conscious exaggeration in it  anywhere, and every statement made in it is substantiated by  evidence. Moreover, the evidence published was only a fraction of  what was in the Committee's possession. Not a single statement,  regarding the validity of which there was the slightest room for  doubt, was permitted to appear in the report. This report,  prepared as it was solely with a view to bringing out the truth and  nothing but the truth, will enable the reader to see to what lengths  the British Government is capable of going, and what inhumanities  and barbarities it is capable of perpetrating in order to maintain  its power. So far as I am aware, not a single statement made in this  report has ever been disproved.  I had expected someone on behalf of Dada Abdulla's attorney to meet me  at Pretoria station. I knew that no Indian would be there to receive  me, since I had particularly promised not to put up at an Indian  house. But the attorney had sent no one. I understood later that as  I had arrived on a Sunday, he could not have sent anyone without  inconvenience. I was perplexed, and wondered where to go, as I  feared that no hotel would accept me. Pretoria station in  was quite different from what it was in  . The lights were burning dimly. The travellers were few. I let  all the other passengers go and thought that, as soon as the ticket  collector was fairly free, I would hand him my ticket and ask him if  he could direct me to some small hotel or any other such place where  I might go; otherwise I would spend the night at the station. I must  confess I shrank from asking him even this, for I was afraid of  being insulted. The station became clear of all passengers. I gave my ticket to the  ticket collector and began my inquiries. He replied to me  courteously, but I saw that he could not be of any considerable  help. But an American Negro who was standing near by broke into the  conversation. 'I see,' said he, 'that you are an utter stranger here, without any  friends. If you will come with me, I will take you to a small hotel,  of which the proprietor is an American who is very well known to me.  I think he will accept you.' I had my own doubts about the offer, but I thanked him and accepted  his suggestion. He took me to Johnson's Family Hotel. He drew Mr.  Johnson aside to speak to him, and the latter agreed to accommodate  me for the night, on condition that I should have my dinner served  in my room. 'I assure you,' said he, 'that I have no colour prejudice. But I  have only European custom, and, if I allowed you to eat in the  dining-room, my guests might be offended and even go away.' 'Thank you,' said I, 'even for accommodating me for the night. I am now  more or less acquainted with the conditions here, and I understand  your difficulty. I do not mind your serving the dinner in my room. I  hope to be able to make some other arrangement tomorrow.' I was shown into a room, where I now sat waiting for the dinner and  musing, as I was quite alone. There were not many guests in the  hotel, and I had expected the waiter to come very shortly with the  dinner. Instead Mr. Johnston appeared. He said: 'I was ashamed of  having asked you to have your dinner here. So I spoke to the other  guests about you, and asked them if they would mind your having your  dinner in the dining-room. They said they had no objection, and that  they did not mind your staying here as long as you liked. Please,  therefore, come to the dining-room, if you will, and stay here as  long as you wish.' I thanked him again, went to the dining-room and had a hearty dinner. Next morning I called on the attorney, Mr. A. W. Baker. Abdulla  Sheth had given me some description of him, so his cordial reception  did not surprise me. He received me very warmly and made kind  inquiries. I explained all about myself. Thereupon he said: 'We have  no work for you here as barrister, for we have engaged the best  counsel. The case is a prolonged and complicated one, so I shall  take your assistance only to the extent of getting necessary  information. And of course you will make communication with my  client easy for me, as I shall now ask for all the information I  want from him through you. That is certainly an advantage, I have  not yet found rooms for you. I thought I had better do so after  having seen you. There is a fearful amount of colour prejudice here,  and therefore it is not easy to find lodgings for such as you. But I  know a poor woman. She is the wife of a baker. I think she will take  you and thus add to her income at the same time. Come, let us go to  her place.' So he took me to her house. He spoke with her privately about me,  and she agreed to accept me as a boarder at  shilling a week. Mr. Baker, besides being an attorney, was a staunch lay preacher, He  is still alive and now engaged purely in missionary work, having  given up the legal profession. He is quite well-to-do. He still  corresponds with me. In his letters he always dwells on the same  theme. He upholds the excellence of Christianity from various points  of view, and contends that it is impossible to find eternal peace,  unless one accepts Jesus as the only son of God and the Saviour of  mankind. During the very first interview Mr. Baker ascertained my religious  views. I said to him: 'I am a Hindu by birth. And yet I do not know  much of Hinduism, and I know less of other religions. In fact I do  not know where I am, and what is and what should be my belief. I  intend to make a careful study of my own religion and, as far as I  can, of other religions as well.' Mr. Baker was glad to hear all this, and said: 'I am one of the  directors of the South Africa General Mission. I have built a church  at my own expense, and deliver sermons in it regularly. I am free  from colour prejudice. I have some co-workers, and we meet at one  o'clock every day for a few minutes and pray for peace and light. I  shall be glad if you will join us there. I shall introduce you to my  co-workers who will be happy to meet you, and I dare say you will  also like their company. I shall give you, besides, some religious  books to read, though of course the book of books is the Holy Bible,  which I would specially recommend to you.' I thanked Mr. Baker and agreed to attend the one o'clock prayers as  regularly as possible. 'So I shall expect you here tomorrow at one o'clock, and we shall go  together to pray,' added Mr. Baker, and we said good-bye. I had little time for reflection just yet. I went to Mr. Johnston, paid the bill and removed to the new  lodgings, where I had my lunch. The landlady was good woman. She had  cooked a vegetarian meal for me. It was not long before I made  myself quite at home with the family. I next went to see the friend to whom Dada Abdulla had given me a  note. From him I learnt more about the hardships of Indians in South  Africa. He insisted that I should stay with him. I thanked him, and  told him that I had already made arrangements. He urged me not to  hesitate to ask for anything I needed. It was now dark. I returned home, had my dinner, went to my room and  lay there absorbed in deep thought. There was not any immediate work  for me. I informed Abdulla Sheth of it. What, I thought, can be  the meaning of Mr. Baker's interest in me? What shall I gain from his  religious co-workers? How far should I undertake the study of  Christianity? How was I to obtain literature about Hinduism? And how  was I to understand Christianity in its proper perspective without  thoroughly knowing my own religion? I could come to only one  conclusion: I should make a dispassionate study of all that came to  me, and deal with Mr. Baker's group as God might guide me; I should  not think of embracing another religion before I had fully  understood my own. Thus musing I fell asleep.......... Thrice in her life my wife narrowly escaped death through serious illness.  The cures were due to household remedies. At the time of her first  attack Satyagraha was going on or was about to commence. She  had frequent haemorrhage. A medical friend advised a surgical  operation, to which she agreed after some hesitation. She was  extremely emaciated, and the doctor had to perform the operation  without chloroform. It was successful, but she had to suffer much  pain. She, however, went through it with wonderful bravery. The  doctor and his wife who nursed her were all attention. This was in  Durban. The doctor gave me leave to go to Johannesburg, and told me  not to have any anxiety about the patient.  In a few days, however, I received a letter to the effect that  Kasturbai was worse, too weak to sit up in bed, and had once become  unconscious. The doctor knew that he might not, without my consent,  give her wines or meat. So he telephoned to me at Johannesburg for  permission to give her beef tea. I replied saying I could not grant  the permission, but that, if she was in a condition to express her  wish in the matter she might be consulted, and she was free to do as  she liked. 'But,' said the doctor, 'I refuse to consult the  patient's wishes in the matter. You must come yourself. If you do  not leave me free to prescribe whatever diet I like, I will not hold  myself responsible for your wife's life.'  I took the train for Durban the same day, and met the doctor who  quietly broke this news to me: 'I had already given Mrs. Gandhi beef  tea when I telephoned to you.'  'Now, doctor, I call this a fraud,' said I.  'No question of fraud in prescribing medicine or diet for a patient.  In fact we doctors consider it a virtue to deceive patients or their  relatives, if thereby we can save our patients, said the doctor with  determination.  I was deeply pained, but kept cool. The doctor was a good man and a  personal friend. He and his wife had laid me under a debt of  gratitude, but I was not prepared to put up with his medical morals.  'Doctor, tell me what you propose to do now. I would never allow my  wife to be given meat or beef, even if the denial meant her death,  unless of course she desired to take it.'  'You are welcome to your philosophy. I tell you that, so long as you  keep your wife under my treatment, I must have the option to give  her anything I wish. If you don't like this, I must regretfully ask  you to remove her. I can't see her die under my roof.' 'Do you mean to say that I must remove her at once?'  'Whenever did I ask you to remove her? I only want to be left  entirely free. If you do so, my wife and I will do all that is  possible for her, and you may go back without the least anxiety on  her score. But if you will not understand this simple thing, you  will compel me to ask you to remove your wife from my place.' I think one of my sons was with me. He entirely agreed with me, and  said his mother should not be given beef tea. I next spoke to  Kasturbai herself. She was really too weak to be consulted in this  matter. But I thought it my painful duty to do so. I told her what  had passed between the doctor and myself. She gave a resolute reply:  'I will not take beef tea. It is a rare thing in this world to be  born as a human being, and I would far rather die in your arms than  pollute my body with such abominations.'  I pleaded with her. I told her that she was not bound to follow me.  I cited to her the instances of Hindu friends and acquaintances who  had no scruples about taking meat or wine as medicine. But she was  adamant. 'No,' said she, 'pray remove me at once.'  I was delighted. Not without some agitation I decided to take her  away. I informed the doctor of her resolve. He exclaimed in a rage:  'What a callous man you are! You should have been ashamed to broach  the matter to her in her present condition. I tell you your wife is  not in a fit state to be removed.\u00a0 She cannot stand the least  little hustling. I shouldn't surprised if she were to die on the  way. But if you must persist, you are free to do so. If you will not  give her beef tea, I will not take the risk of keeping her under my  roof even for a single day.'  So we decided to leave the place at once. It was drizzling and the  station was some distance. We had to take the train from Durban for  Phoenix, whence our Settlement was reached by a road of two miles  and a half. I was undoubtedly taking a very great risk, but I  trusted in God, and proceeded with my task. I sent a messenger to  Phoenix in advance, with a message to West to receive us at the  station with a hammock, a bottle of hot milk and one of hot water,  and six men to carry kasturbai in the hammock. I got a rickshaw to  enable me to take her by the next available train, put her into it  in that dangerous condition, and marched away.  Kasturbai needed no cheering up. On the contrary, she comforted me,  saying: 'Nothing will happen to me. Don't worry.'  She was mere skin and bone, having had no nourishment for days. The  station platform was very large, and as the rickshaw could not be  taken inside, one had to walk some distance before one could reach  the train. So I carried her in my arms and put her into the  compartment. From Phoenix we carried her in the hammock, and there  she slowly picked up strength under hydropathic treatment.  In two or three days of our arrival at Phoenix a Swami came to our  place. He had heard of the resolute way in which we had rejected the  doctor's advice, and he had, out of sympathy, come to plead with us.  My second and third sons Manilal and Ramdas were, so far as I can  recollect, present when the Swami came. He held forth on the  religious harmlessness of taking meat, citing authorities from Manu.  I did not like his carrying on this disputation in the presence of  my wife, but I suffered him to do so out of courtesy. I knew the  verses from the Manusmriti, I did not need them for my conviction. I knew also that there was a  school which regarded these verses as interpolations: but even if  they were not, I held my views on vegetarianism independently of  religious texts, and Kasturbai's faith was unshakable. To her the  scriptural texts were a sealed book, but the traditional religion of  her forefathers was enough for her. The children swore by their  father's creed and so they made light of the Swami's discourse. But  Kasturbai put an end to the dialogue at once. 'Swamiji,' she said,  'whatever you may say, I do not want to recover by means of beef  tea. Pray don't worry me any more. You may discuss the thing with my  husband and children if you like. But my mind is made up.'  My first experience of jail life was in . I saw that some of the  regulations that the prisoners had to observe were such as should   voluntarily be observed by a brahmachari,  that is, one desiring to practise self-restraint. Such, for  instance, was the regulation requiring the last meal to be finished  before sunset. Neither the Indian nor the African prisoners were  allowed tea or coffee. They could add salt to the cooked food if  they wished, but they might not have anything for the mere  satisfaction of the palate. When I asked the jail medical officer to  give us curry powder, and to let us add salt to the food whilst it  was cooking, he said: 'You are not here for satisfying your palate.  From the point of view of health, curry powder is not necessary, and  it makes no difference whether you add salt during or after  cooking.'  Ultimately these restrictions were modified, though not without  much difficulty, but both were wholesome rules of self-restraint.  Inhibitions imposed from without rarely succeed, but when they are  self-imposed, they have a decidedly salutary effect. So, immediately  after release from jail, I imposed on myself the two rules. As far  as was then possible, I stopped taking tea, and finished my last  meal before sunset. Both these now require no effort in the  observance.  There came, however an occasion which compelled me to give up salt  altogether, and this restriction I continued for an unbroken period  of ten years. I had read in some books on vegetarianism that salt  was not a necessary article of diet for man, that on the contrary  saltless diet was better for the health. I had deduced that a  brahmachari benefited by a saltless diet. I had read and realized  that the weak-bodied should avoid pulses. I was very fond of them. Now it happened that Kasturbai, who had a brief respite after her  operation, had again begun getting haemorrhage, and the malady  seemed to be obstinate. Hydropathic treatment by itself did not  answer. She had not much faith in my remedies, though she did not  resist them. She certainly did not ask for outside help. So when all  my remedies had failed, I entreated her to give up salt and pulses.  She would not agree, however much I pleaded with her, supporting  myself with authorities. At last she challenged me, saying that even  I could not give up these articles if I was advised to do so. I was  pained and equally delighted \u2013 delighted in that I got an opportunity  to shower my love on her. I said to her: 'You are mistaken. If I was  ailing and the doctor advised me to give up these or any other  articles, I should unhesitatingly do so. But there! Without any  medical advice, I give up salt and pulses for one year, whether you  do so or not.'  She was rudely shocked and exclaimed in deep sorrow:  'Pray forgive me. Knowing you, I should not have provoked you. I  promise to abstain from these things, but for heaven's sake take  back your vow. This is too hard on me.'  'It is very good for you to forego these articles. I have not the  slightest doubt that you will be all the better without them. As for  me, I cannot retract a vow seriously taken. And it is sure to  benefit me, for all restraint, whatever prompts it, is wholesome for  men. You will therefore leave me alone. It will be a test for me,  and a moral support to you in carrying out your resolve.' So she gave me up. 'You are too obstinate. You will listen to none,'  she said, and sought relief in tears.  I would like to count this incident as an instance of Satyagraha,  and it is one of the sweetest recollections of my life. After this Kasturbai began to pick up quickly \u2013 whether as a result of  the saltless and pulseless diet or of the other consequent changes  in her food; whether as a result of my strict vigilance in exacting  observance of the other rules of life, or as an effect of the mental  exhilaration produced by the incident, and if so to what extent, I  cannot say. But she rallied quickly, haemorrhage completely stopped,  and I added somewhat to my reputation as a quack.  As for me, I was all the better for the new denials. I never craved  for the things I had left, the year sped away, and I found the  senses to be more subdued than ever. The experiment stimulated the  inclination for self-restraint, and I continues the abstention from  the articles until long after I returned to India. Only once I  happened to take both the articles whilst I was in London in .  But of that occasion, and as to how I resumed both, I shall speak in  a later chapter.  I have tried the experiment of a saltles and pulseless diet on many  of my co-workers, and with good results in South Africa. Medically  there may be two opinions as to the value of this diet, but morally  I have no doubt that all self-denial is good for the soul. The diet  of a man of self-restraint must be different from that of a man of  pleasure, just as their ways of life must be different. Aspirants  after brahmacharya often defeat their own end by adopting courses suited to a life of  pleasure.  soon as the news reached South Africa that I along with other  Indians had offered my services in the war, I received two cables.  One of these was from Mr. Polak who questioned the consistency of my  action with my profession of ahimsa.  I had to a certain extent anticipated this objection, for I had  discussed the question in my Hind Swaraj (Indian Home Rule), and  used to discuss it day in and day out with friends in South Africa.  All of us recognized the immorality of war. If I was not prepared to  prosecute my assailant, much less would I be willing to participate  in a war, especially when I knew nothing of the justice or otherwise  of the cause of the combatants. Friends of course knew that I had  previously served in the Boer War, but they assumed that my views  had since undergone a change.  As a matter of fact the very same line of argument that persuaded me  to take part in the Boer War had weighed with me on this occasion.  It was quite clear to me that participation in war could never be  consistent with ahimsa. But it is not always given to one to be  equally clear about one's duty. A votary of truth is often obliged  to grope in the dark.  Ahimsa is a comprehensive principle. We are helpless mortals caught  in the conflagration of himsa. The saying that life lives on life  has a deep meaning in it. Man cannot for a moment live without  consciously or unconsciously committing outward himsa. The very  fact of his living \u2013 eating, drinking and moving about \u2013 necessarily  involves some himsa, destruction of life, be it ever so minute. A  votary of ahimsa therefore remains true to his faith if the spring  of all his actions is compassion, if he shuns to the best of his  ability the destruction of the tiniest creature, tries to save it,  and thus incessantly strives to be free from the deadly coil of himsa.  He will be constantly growing in self-restraint and  compassion, but he can never become entirely free from outward himsa. Then again, because underlying ahimsa is the unity of all life, the  error of one cannot but affect all, and hence man cannot be wholly  free from himsa. So long as he continues to be a social being, he  cannot but participate in the himsa that the very existence of  society involves. When two nations are fighting, the duty of a  votary of ahimsa is to stop the war. He who is not equal to that  duty, he who has no power of resisting war, he who is not qualified  to resist war, may take part in war, and yet whole-heartedly try to  free himself, his nation and the world from war.  I had hoped to improve my status and that of my people through the  British Empire. Whilst in England I was enjoying the protection of  the British Fleet, and taking shelter as I did under its armed  might, I was directly participating in its potential violence.  Therefore, if I desired to retain my connection with the Empire and  to live under its banner, one of three courses was open to me: I  could declare open resistance to the war and, in accordance with the  law of Satyagraha, boycott the Empire until it changed its military  policy; or I could seek imprisonment by civil disobedience of such  of its laws as were fit to be disobeyed; or I could participate in  the war on the side of the Empire and thereby acquire the capacity  and fitness for resisting the violence of war. I lacked this  capacity and fitness, as I thought there was nothing for it but to  serve in the war.  I make no distinction, from the point of view of ahimsa, between  combatants and non-combatants. He who volunteers to serve a band of  dacoits, by working as their carrier, or their watchman while they  are about their business, or their nurse when they are wounded, is  as much guilty of dacoity as the dacoits themselves. In the same way  those who confine themselves to attending to the wounded in battle  cannot be absolved from the guilt of war.  I had argued the whole thing out to myself in this manner, before I received Polak's cable,  and soon after its receipt, I discussed these views with several  friends and concluded that it was my duty to offer to serve in the  war. Even today I see no flaw in that line of argument, nor am I  sorry for my action, holding, as I then did, views favourable to the  British connection.  I know that even then I could not carry conviction with all my  friends about the correctness of my position. The question is  subtle. It admits of differences of opinion, and therefore I have  submitted my argument as clearly as possible to those who believe in  ahimsa and who are making serious efforts to practise it in every  walk of life. A devotee of Truth may not do anything in deference to  convention. He must always hold himself open to correction, and  whenever he discovers himself to be wrong he must confess it at all  costs and atone for it.  On arrival in England I learned that Gokhale had been stranded in Paris  where he had gone for reasons of health, and as communication  between Paris and London had been cut off, there was no knowing when  he would return. I did not want to go home without having seen him,  but no one could say definitely when he would arrive.  What then was I to do in the meanwhile? What was my duty as regards  the war? Sorabji Adajania, my comrade in jail and a Satyagrahi, was  then reading for the bar in London. As one of the best Satyagrahis  he had been sent to England to qualify himself as a barrister, so  that he might take my place on return to South Africa. Dr.  Pranjivandas Mehta was paying his expenses. With him, and through  him, I had conferences with Dr. Jivraj Mehta and others who were  persuing their studies in England. In consultation with them, a  meeting of the Indian residents in Great Britain and Ireland was  called. I placed my views before them.  I felt that Indians residing  in England ought to do their bit in the war. English students had  volunteered to serve in the army, and Indians might do no less. A  number of objections were taken to this line of argument. There was,  it was contended, a world of difference between the Indians and the  English. We were slaves and they were masters. How could a slave  co-operate with the master in the hour of the latter's need? Was it  not the duty of the slave, seeking to be free, to make the master's  need his opportunity? This argument failed to appeal to me then. I  knew the difference of status between an Indian and an Englishman,  but I did not believe that we had been quite reduced to slavery. I  felt then that it was more the fault of individual British officials  than of the British system, and that we could convert them by love.  If we would improve our status through the help and co-operation of  the British, it was our duty to win their help by standing by them  in their hour of need. Though the system was faulty, it did not seem  to me to be intolerable, as it does today. But if, having lost my  faith in the system, I refuse to co-operate with the British  Government today, how could those friends do so, having lost  their faith not only in the system but in the officials as well? The opposing friends felt that that was the hour for making a bold  declaration of Indian demands and for improving the status of Indians.  I thought that England's need should not be turned into our  opportunity, and that it was more becoming and far-sighted not to  press our demands while the war lasted. I therefore adhered to my  advice and invited those who would to enlist as volunteers. There  was a good response, practically all the provinces and all the  religions being represented among the volunteers.  I wrote a letter to Lord Crewe, acquainting him with these facts,  and expressing our readiness to be trained for ambulance work, if  that should be considered a condition precedent to the acceptance of  our offer.  Lord Crewe accepted the offer after some hesitation, and thanked us  for having tendered our services to the Empire at that critical  hour.  The volunteers began their preliminary training in first aid to the  wounded under the well-known Dr.Cantlie. It was a short course of  six weeks, but it covered the whole course of first aid.  We were a class of about eighty. In six weeks we were examined, and all  except one passed. For these the Government now provided military  drill and other training. Colonel Baker was placed in charge of this  work.  London in these days was a sight worth seeing. There was no panic,  but all were busy helping to the best of their ability. Able-bodied  adults began training as combatants, but what were the old, the  infirm and the women to do? There was enough work for them, if they  wanted. So they employed themselves in cutting and making clothes  and dressings for the wounded.  The Lyceum, a ladies' club, undertook to make as many clothes for  the soldiers as they could. Shrimati Sarojini Naidu was a member of  this club, and threw herself whole-heartedly into the work. This was  my first acquaintance with her. She placed before me a heap of  clothes which had been cut to pattern, and asked me to get them all  sewn up and return them to her. I welcomed her demand and with the  assistance of friends got as many clothes made as I could manage  during my training for first aid.  I must skip many of the recollections of South Africa.  At the conclusion of the Satyagraha struggle in , I received Gokhale's  instruction to return home via London. So in July Kasturbai,  Kallenbach and I sailed for England.  During Satyagraha I had begun traveling third class. I therefore  took third class passages for this voyage. But there was a good deal  of difference between third class accommodation on the boat on this  route and that provided on Indian coastal boats or railway trains.  There is hardly sufficient sitting, much less sleeping,  accommodation in the Indian service, and little cleanliness. During  the voyage to London, on the other hand, there was enough room and  cleanliness, and the steamship company had provided special  facilities for us. The company had provided reserved closet  accommodation for us, and as we were fruitarians, the steward had  orders to supply us with fruits and nuts. As a rule third class  passengers get little fruit or nuts. These facilities made our  eighteen days on the boat quite comfortable.  Some of the incidents during the voyage are well worth recording.  Mr. Kallenbach was very fond of binoculars, and had one or two  costly pairs. We had daily discussions over one of these. I tried to  impress on him that this possession was not in keeping with the  ideal of simplicity that we aspired to reach. Our discussions came  to a head one day, as we were standing near the porthole of our  cabin.  'Rather than allow these to be a bone of contention between us, why  not throw them into the sea and be done with them?' said I.  'Certainly throw the wretched things away,' said Mr. Kallenbach. 'I mean it,' said I.  'So do I,' quickly came the reply.  And forthwith I flung them into  the sea. They were worth some \u00a3, but their value lay less in their  price than in Mr. Kallenbach's infatuation for them. However, having  got rid of them, he never regretted it.  This is but one out of the many incidents that happened between Mr. Kallenbach and me.  Every day we had to learn something new in this way, for both of us  were trying to tread the path of Truth. In the march towards Truth,  anger, selfishness, hatred, etc., naturally give way, for otherwise  Truth would be impossible to attain. A man who is swayed by passions  may have good enough intentions, may be truthful in word, but he  will never find the Truth. A successful search for Truth means  complete deliverance from the dual throng such as of love and hate,  happiness and misery.  Not much time had elapsed since my fast when we started on our  voyage. I had not regained my normal strength. I used to stroll on  deck to get a little exercise, so as to revive my appetite and  digest what I ate. But even this exercise was beyond me, causing  me pain in the calves, so much so that on reaching London I found that  I was worse rather than better. There I came to know Dr. Jivraj  Mehta. I gave him the history of my fast and subsequent pain, and he  said, 'If you do not take complete rest for a few days, there is a  fear of your legs going out of use.'  It was then that I learned that a man emerging from a long fast  should not be in a hurry to regain lost strength, and should also  put a curb on his appetite. More caution and perhaps more restraint  are necessary in breaking a fast than in keeping it.  In Madeira we heard that the great War might break out at any  moment. As we entered the English Channel, we received the news of  its actual outbreak. We were stopped for some time. It was a  difficult business to tow the boat through the submarine mines which  had been laid throughout the Channel, and it took about two days to  reach Southampton.  War was declared on the th of August. We reached London on the th.  Day by day it became increasingly clear to me how very difficult it was  to bring up and educate boys and girls in the right way. If I was to  be their real teacher and guardian, I must touch their hearts. I  must share their joys and sorrows, I must help them to solve the  problems that faced them, and I must take along the right channel  the surging aspirations of their youth.  On the release of some of the Satyagrahis from jail, Tolstoy Farm  was almost denuded of its inmates. The few that remained mostly  belonged to Phoenix. So I removed them there. Here I had to pass  through a fiery ordeal.  In those days I had to move between Johannesburg and Phoenix. Once  when I was in Johannesburg I received tidings of the moral fall of  two of the inmates of the Ashram. News of an apparent failure or  reverse in the Satyagraha struggle would not have shocked me, but  this news came upon me like a thunderbolt. The same day I took the  train for Phoenix. Mr. Kallenbach insisted on accompanying me. He  had noticed the state I was in. He would not brook the thought of my  going alone, for he happened to be the bearer of the tidings which  had so upset me.  During the journey my duty seemed clear to me. I felt that the  guardian or teacher was responsible, to some extent at least, for  the lapse of his ward or pupil. So my responsibility regarding the  incident in question became clear to me as daylight. My wife had  already warned me in the matter, but being of a trusting nature, I  had ignored her caution. I felt that the only way the guilty parties  could be made to realize my distress and the depth of their own fall  would be for me to do some penance. So I imposed upon myself a fast  for seven days and a vow to have only one meal a day for a period of  four months and a half. Mr. Kallenbach tried to dissuade me, but in  vain. He finally conceded the propriety of the penance, and insisted  on joining me. I could not resist his transparent affection. I felt greatly relieved, for the decision meant a heavy load off my mind.  The anger against the guilty parties subsided and gave place to the  purest pity for them. Thus considerably eased, I reached Phoenix, I  made further investigation and acquainted myself with some more  details I needed to know.  My penance pained everybody, but it cleared the atmosphere. Everyone  came to realize what a terrible thing it was to be sinful, and the  bond that bound me to the boys and girls became stronger and truer. A circumstance arising out of this incident compelled me, a little  while after, to go into a fast for fourteen days, the results of  which exceeded even my expectations.  It is not my purpose to make out from these incidents that it is the  duty of a teacher to resort to fasting whenever there is a  delinquency on the part of his pupils. I hold, however, that some  occasions do call for this drastic remedy. But it presupposes  clearness of vision and spiritual fitness. Where there is no true  love between the teacher and the pupil, where the pupil's  delinquency has not touched the very being of the teacher and where  the pupil has no respect for the teacher, fasting is out of place  and may even be harmful. Though there is thus room for doubting the  propriety of fasts in such cases, there is no question about the  teacher's responsibility for the error of his pupil.  The first penance did not prove difficult for any of us. I had to suspend or  stop none of my normal activities. It may be recalled that during  the whole of this period of penance I was a strict fruitarian. The  latter part of the second fast went fairly hard with me. I had not  then completely understood the wonderful efficacy of Ramanama, and  my capacity for suffering was to that extent less. Besides, I did  not know the technique of fasting, especially the necessity of  drinking plenty of water, however nauseating or distasteful it might  be. Then the fact that the first fast had been an easy affair had  made me rather careless as to the second. Thus during the first I  took Kuhne baths every day, but during the second I gave them up  after two or three days, and drank very little water, as it was  distasteful and produced nausea. The throat became parched and weak  and during the last days I could speak only in a very low voice. In  spite of this, however, my work was carried on through dictation  where writing was necessary. I regularly listened to readings from  the Ramayana and other sacred books. I had also sufficient strength  to discuss and advise in all urgent matters.  Champaran is the land of King Janaka. Just as it abounds in mango groves, so  used it to be full of indigo plantations until the year . The  Champaran tenant was bound by law to plant three out of every twenty  parts of his land with indigo for his landlord. This system was  known as the tinkathia system, as three kathas out of twenty  (which make one acre) had to be planted with indigo.  I must confess that I did not then know even the name, much less the  geographical position, of Champaran, and I had hardly any notion of  indigo plantations. I had seen packets of indigo, but little dreamed  that it was grown and manufactured in Champaran at great hardship to  thousands of agriculturists.  Rajkumar Shukla was one of the agriculturists who had been under  this harrow, and he was filled with a passion to wash away the stain  of indigo for the thousands who were suffering as he had suffered. This man caught hold of me at Lucknow, where I had gone for the  Congress of . 'Vakil Babu will tell you everything about our  distress,' he said, and urged me to go to Champaran. 'Vakil Babu'  was none other than Babu Brajkishore Prasad, who became my esteemed  co-worker in Champaran, and who is the soul of public work in  Bihar. Rajkumar Shukla brought him to my tent. He was dressed in a  black alpaca achkan and trousers. Brijkishore Babu failed then to  make an impression on me. I took it that he must be some vakil  exploiting the simple agriculturists. Having heard from him  something of Champaran, I replied as was my wont: 'I can give no  opinion without seeing the condition with my own eyes. You will  please move the resolution in the Congress, but leave me free for  the present.' Rajkumar Shukla of course wanted some help from the  Congress. Babu Brajkishore Prasad moved the resolution, expressing  sympathy for the people of Champaran, and it was unanimously passed. Rajkumar Shukla was glad, but far from satisfied. He wanted me  personally to visit Champaran and witness the miseries of the ryots  there. I told him that I would include Champaran in the tour which I  had contemplated and give it a day or two. 'One day will be enough,'  said he, 'and you will see things with your own eyes.' From Lucknow I went to Cawnpore. Rajkumar Shukla followed me there.  'Champaran is very near here. Please give a day,' he insisted.' Pray  excuse me this time. But I promise that I will come,' said I,  further committing myself.  I returned to the Ashram. The ubiquitous Rajkumar was there too.  'Pray fix the day now', he said. 'Well,' said I, 'I have to be in  Calcutta on such and such a date, come and meet me then, and take me  from there.' I did not know where I was to go, what to do, what  things to see.  Before I reached Bhupen Babu's place in Calcutta, Rajkumar Shukla  had gone and established himself there. Thus this ignorant,  unsophisticated but resolute agriculturist captured me. So early in , we left Calcutta for Champaran, looking just like  fellow rustics. I did not even know the train. He took me to it, and  we travelled together, reaching Patna in the morning.  This was my first visit to Patna. I had no friend or acquaintance  with whom I could think of putting up. I had an idea that Rajkumar  Shukla, simple agriculturist as he was, must have some influence in  Patna. I had come to know him a little more on the journey, and on  reaching Patna I had no illusions left concerning him. He was  perfectly innocent of every thing. The vakils that he had taken to  be his friends were really nothing of the sort. Poor Rajkumar was  more or less as a menial to them. Between such agriculturist clients  and their vakils there is a gulf as wide as the Ganges in flood. Rajkumar Shukla took me to Rajendra Babu's place in Patna. Rajendra  Babu had gone to Puri or some other place, I now forget which. There  were one or two servants at the bungalow who paid us no attention. I  had with me something to eat. I wanted dates which my companion  procured for me from the bazaar.  There was strict untouchability in Bihar. I might not draw water at  the well whilst the servants were using it, lest drops of water from  my bucket might pollute them, the servants not knowing to what caste  I belonged. Rajkumar directed me to the indoor latrine, the servant  promptly directed me to the outdoor one. All this was far from  surprising or irritating to me, for I was inured to such things. The  servants were doing the duty, which they thought Rajendra Babu would  wish them to do.  These entertaining experiences enhanced my regard for Rajkumar  Shukla, if they also enabled me to know him better. I saw now that  Rajkumar Shukla could not guide me, and that I must take the reins  in my own hands. "
