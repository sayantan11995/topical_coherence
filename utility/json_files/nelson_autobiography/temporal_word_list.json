    "1939-1945": " USUALLY, when I returned to Mqhekezweni I did so with a sense of ease and completion. But not so this time. After passing my exams and\nreturning home, I told the regent what had transpired. He was furious, and could not comprehend the reasons for my actions. He thought it utterly\nsenseless. Without even hearing my full explanation, he bluntly informed me that I would obey the principal\u2019s instructions and return to Fort Hare in\nthe fall. His tone invited no discussion. It would have been pointless as well as disrespectful for me to debate my benefactor. I resolved to let the\nmatter rest for a while.\nJustice had also returned to Mqhekezweni and we were mightily glad to see one another. No matter how long Justice and I were apart, the\nbrotherly bonds that united us were instantly renewed. Justice had left school the year before and was living in Cape Town.\nWithin a few days, I resumed my old life at home. I looked after matters for the regent, including his herd and his relations with other chiefs. I did\nnot dwell on the situation at Fort Hare, but life has a way of forcing decisions on those who vacillate. It was an entirely different matter unrelated to\nmy studies that forced my hand.\nA few weeks after my homecoming, the regent summoned Justice and me to a meeting. \u201cMy children,\u201d he said in a very somber tone, \u201cI fear that I\nam not much longer for this world, and before I journey to the land of the ancestors, it is my duty to see my two sons properly married. I have,\naccordingly, arranged unions for both of you.\u201d\nThis announcement took us both by surprise, and Justice and I looked at each other with a mixture of shock and helplessness. The two girls\ncame from very good families, the regent said. Justice was to marry the daughter of Khalipa, a prominent Thembu nobleman, and Rolihlahla, as the\nregent always called me, was to marry the daughter of the local Thembu priest. The marriages, he said, were to take place immediately. Lobola,\nthe brideprice or dowry, is normally paid in the form of cattle by the groom\u2019s father, and would be paid by the community in Justice\u2019s case and in my\nown by the regent himself.\nJustice and I said little. It was not our place to question the regent, and as far as he was concerned, the matter was settled. The regent brooked\nno discussion: the bride had already been selected and lobola paid. It was final.\nJustice and I walked out of our interview with our heads down, dazed and dejected. The regent was acting in accordance with Thembu law and\ncustom, and his own motives could not be maligned: he wanted us to be settled during his lifetime. We had always known that the regent had the\nright to arrange marriages for us, but now it was no longer an abstract possibility. The brides were not fantasies, but flesh-and-blood women whom\nwe actually knew.\nWith all due respect to the young woman\u2019s family, I would be dishonest if I said that the girl the regent had selected for me was my dream bride.\nHer family was prominent and respected and she was attractive in a rather dignified way, but this young lady, I am afraid, had long been in love with\nJustice. The regent would not have known this, as parents rarely know the romantic side of their children\u2019s lives. My intended partner was\nundoubtedly no more eager to be burdened with me than I was with her.\nAt that time, I was more advanced socially than politically. While I would not have considered fighting the political system of the white man, I was\nquite prepared to rebel against the social system of my own people. Ironically, it was the regent himself who was indirectly to blame for this, for it\nwas the education he had afforded me that had caused me to reject such traditional customs. I had attended college and university with women for\nyears, and had had a small handful of love affairs. I was a romantic, and I was not prepared to have anyone, even the regent, select a bride for me.\nI made an appointment with the queen, the regent\u2019s wife, and put my case to her. I could not tell her that I did not want the regent to arrange a\nbride for me under any circumstances, as she would naturally have been unsympathetic. Instead, I devised an alternative plan, and told her that I\npreferred to marry a girl who was a relative of the queen\u2019s, whom I found desirable as a prospective partner. This young lady was in fact very\nattractive, but I had no idea as to what she thought of me. I said I would marry her as soon as I completed my studies. This was half a ruse, but it\nwas a better alternative than the regent\u2019s plan. The queen took my side in the matter, but the regent could not be dissuaded. He had made his\ndecision and he was not going to alter it.\nI felt as though he had left me no choice. I could not go through with this marriage, which I considered unfair and ill-advised. At the same time, I\nbelieved that I could no longer remain under the regent\u2019s guidance if I rejected his plan for me. Justice agreed, and the two of us decided that the\nonly option remaining was to run away, and the only place to run to was Johannesburg.\nIn retrospect, I realize that we did not exhaust all the options available to us. I could have attempted to discuss the matter with the regent through\nintermediaries and perhaps come to some settlement within the framework of our tribe and family. I could have appealed to the regent\u2019s cousin,\nChief Zilindlovu, one of the most enlightened and influential chiefs at the court of Mqhekezweni. But I was young and impatient, and did not see any\nvirtue in waiting. Escape seemed the only course.\nWe kept our plot secret while we worked out its details. First, we needed an opportunity. The regent believed Justice and I brought out the worst\nin each other, or at least Justice\u2019s penchant for adventures and high-jinks influenced my more conservative disposition. As a result, he took pains to\nkeep us separate as much as possible. When the regent was traveling, he generally asked one of us to accompany him so that we would not be\nalone together in his absence. More often than not, he took Justice with him, as he liked me to remain in Mqhekezweni to look after his affairs. But\nwe learned that the regent was preparing to leave for a full week to attend a session of the Bunga, the Transkeian legislative assembly, without\neither of us, and we decided this was the ideal time to steal away. We resolved that we would depart for Johannesburg shortly after the regent left\nfor the Bunga.\nI had few clothes and we managed to get whatever we had in a single suitcase. The regent left early on Monday, and by late morning we were\nready to go. But just as we were preparing to leave, the regent unexpectedly returned. We saw his car drive in and we ran into the garden and hid\namong the mealie stalks. The regent came into the house and his first question was \u201cWhere are those boys?\u201d Someone replied, \u201cOh, they are\naround.\u201d But the regent was suspicious, and was not content with that explanation. He had returned, he said, because he had forgotten to take his\nEpsom salts. He looked around a bit, and then seemed satisfied. I realized that he must have had some kind of premonition because he could\neasily buy Epsom salts in town. When his car disappeared behind the hills, we were on our way.\nWe had almost no money between us, but that morning, we went to see a local trader and made a deal to sell him two of the regent\u2019s prize oxen.\nThe trader assumed that we were selling the animals at the regent\u2019s behest, and we did not correct him. He paid us a very good price, and with that\nmoney we hired a car to take us to the local train station where we would catch a train to Johannesburg.\nAll seemed to be going smoothly, but unbeknown to us, the regent had driven to the local train station and instructed the manager that if two boys\nfitting our description came to buy tickets for Johannesburg, the manager must turn them away because we were not to leave the Transkei. We\narrived at the station only to find that the manager would not sell us tickets. We asked him why and he said, \u201cYour father has been here and says\nyou are trying to run away.\u201d We were stunned by this, and dashed back to our hired car and told him to drive to the next station. It was nearly fifty\nmiles away, and it took us more than an hour to get there.\n\n\fWe managed to get on a train there but it only went as far as Queenstown. In the s, traveling for an African was a complicated process. All\nAfricans over the age of sixteen were compelled to carry \u201cNative passes\u201d issued by the Native Affairs Department and were required to show that\npass to any white policeman, civil servant, or employer. Failure to do so could mean arrest, trial, a jail sentence or fine. The pass stated where the\nbearer lived, who his chief was, and whether he had paid the annual poll tax, which was a tax levied only on Africans. Later, the pass took the form\nof a booklet or \u201creference book,\u201d as it was known, containing detailed information that had to be signed by one\u2019s employer every month.\nJustice and I had our passes in order, but for an African to leave his magisterial district and enter that of another for the purpose of working or\nliving, he needed traveling documents, a permit, and a letter from his employer or, as in our case, his guardian \u2014 none of which we had. Even at\nthe best of times, when one had all these documents, a police officer might harass you because one was missing a signature or had an incorrect\ndate. Not having any of them was extremely risky. Our plan was to disembark in Queenstown, make our way to the house of a relative, and then\nmake arrangements for the necessary documents. This was also an ill-considered plan, but we came in for a bit of luck because at the house in\nQueenstown we accidentally met Chief Mpondombini, a brother of the regent\u2019s, who was fond of Justice and myself.\nChief Mpondombini greeted us warmly and we explained that we needed the requisite travel documents from the local magistrate. We lied about\nwhy we required them, claiming that we were on an errand for the regent. Chief Mpondombini was a retired interpreter from the Native Affairs\nDepartment and knew the chief magistrate well. He had no reason to doubt our story and not only escorted us to the magistrate, but vouched for us\nand explained our predicament. After listening to the chief, the magistrate rapidly made out the necessary traveling documents and affixed the\nofficial stamp. Justice and I looked at each other and smiled in complicity. But just as the magistrate was handing over the documents to us, he\nrecalled something and said that, as a matter of courtesy, he ought to inform the chief magistrate of Umtata, in whose jurisdiction we fell. This made\nus uneasy, but we stayed seated in his office. The magistrate cranked the telephone and reached his colleague in Umtata. As luck would have it,\nthe regent was just then paying a call on the chief magistrate of Umtata and was in his very office.\nAs our magistrate was explaining our situation to the chief magistrate of Umtata, the latter gentleman said something like, \u201cOh, their father just\nhappens to be right here,\u201d and then put the regent on the telephone. When the magistrate informed the regent what we were requesting, the regent\nexploded. \u201cArrest those boys!\u201d he shouted, loud enough that we could hear his voice through the receiver. \u201cArrest them and bring them back here\nimmediately!\u201d The chief magistrate put down the phone. He regarded us angrily. \u201cYou boys are thieves and liars,\u201d he told us. \u201cYou have presumed\nupon my good offices and then deceived me. Now, I am going to have you arrested.\u201d\nI immediately rose to our defense. From my studies at Fort Hare, I had a little knowledge of law and I put it to use. I said that we had told him lies,\nthat was true. But we had committed no offense and violated no laws, and we could not be arrested simply on the recommendation of a chief, even\nif he happened to be our father. The magistrate backed off and did not arrest us, but told us to leave his office and never to darken his door again.\nChief Mpondombini was also annoyed, and left us to our own devices. Justice remembered that he had a friend in Queenstown named Sidney\nNxu who was working in the office of a white attorney. We went to see this fellow, explained our situation, and he told us that the mother of the\nattorney he worked for was driving into Johannesburg and he would see if she would offer us a lift. He told us that his mother would give us a ride if\nwe paid a fee of fifteen pounds sterling. This was a vast sum, far more than the cost of a train ticket. The fee virtually depleted our savings, but we\nhad no choice. We decided to risk getting our passes stamped and the correct travel documents once we were in Johannesburg.\nWe left early the following morning. In those days, it was customary for blacks to ride in the back seat of the car if a white was driving. The two of\nus sat in that fashion, with Justice directly behind the woman. Justice was a friendly, exuberant person and immediately began chatting to me. This\nmade the old woman extremely uncomfortable. She had obviously never been in the company of a black who had no inhibitions around whites. After\nonly a few miles, she told Justice that she wanted him to switch seats with me, so that she could keep an eye on him, and for the rest of the journey\nshe watched him like a hawk. But after a while, Justice\u2019s charm worked on her and she would occasionally laugh at something he said.\n\nAt about ten o\u2019clock that evening, we saw before us, glinting in the distance, a maze of lights that seemed to stretch in all directions. Electricity, to\nme, had always been a novelty and a luxury, and here was a vast landscape of electricity, a city of light. I was terribly excited to see the city I had\nbeen hearing about since I was a child. Johannesburg had always been depicted as a city of dreams, a place where one could transform oneself\nfrom a poor peasant to a wealthy sophisticate, a city of danger and of opportunity. I remembered the stories that Banabakhe had told us at\ncircumcision school, of buildings so tall you could not see the tops, of crowds of people speaking languages you had never heard of, of sleek\nmotorcars and beautiful women and dashing gangsters. It was eGoli, the city of gold, where I would soon be making my home.\nOn the outskirts of the city the traffic became denser. I had never seen so many cars on the road at one time \u2014 even in Umtata, there were never\nmore than a handful of cars and here there were thousands. We drove around the city, rather than through it, but I could see the silhouette of the tall,\nblocky buildings, even darker against the dark night sky. I looked at great billboards by the side of the road, advertising cigarettes and candy and\nbeer. It all seemed tremendously glamorous.\nSoon we were in an area of stately mansions, even the smallest of which was bigger than the regent\u2019s palace, with grand front lawns and tall iron\ngates. This was the suburb where the old lady\u2019s daughter lived, and we pulled into the long driveway of one of these beautiful homes. Justice and I\nwere dispatched to the servants\u2019 wing, where we were to spend the night. We thanked the old lady, and then crawled off to sleep on the floor. But\nthe prospect of Johannesburg was so exciting to me that I felt like I slept on a beautiful feather bed that night. The possibilities seemed infinite. I had\nreached the end of what seemed like a long journey, but was actually the very beginning of a much longer and more trying journey that would test me\nin ways that I could not then have imagined. LIFE IN ALEXANDRA was exhilarating and precarious. Its atmosphere was alive, its spirit adventurous, its people resourceful. Although the\ntownship did boast some handsome buildings, it could fairly be described as a slum, living testimony to the neglect of the authorities. The roads\nwere unpaved and dirty, and filled with hungry, undernourished children scampering around half-naked. The air was thick with the smoke from coal\nfires in tin braziers and stoves. A single water tap served several houses. Pools of stinking, stagnant water full of maggots collected by the side of\nthe road. Alexandra was known as \u201cDark City\u201d for its complete absence of electricity. Walking home at night was perilous, for there were no lights,\nthe silence pierced by yells, laughter, and occasional gunfire. So different from the darkness of the Transkei, which seemed to envelop one in a\nwelcome embrace.\nThe township was desperately overcrowded; every square foot was occupied either by a ramshackle house or a tin-roofed shack. As so often\nhappens in desperately poor places, the worst elements came to the fore. Life was cheap; the gun and the knife ruled at night. Gangsters \u2014 known\na s tsotsis \u2014 carrying flick-knives or switchblades were plentiful and prominent; in those days they emulated American movie stars and wore\nfedoras and double-breasted suits and wide, colorful ties. Police raids were a regular feature of life. The police routinely arrested masses of people\nfor pass violations, possession of liquor, and failure to pay the poll tax. On almost every corner there were shebeens, illegal saloons that were\nshacks where home-brewed beer was served.\nIn spite of the hellish aspects of life in Alexandra, the township was also a kind of heaven. As one of the few areas of the country where Africans\ncould acquire freehold property and run their own affairs, where people did not have to kowtow to the tyranny of white municipal authorities,\nAlexandra was an urban Promised Land, evidence that a section of our people had broken their ties with the rural areas and become permanent\ncity dwellers. The government, in order to keep Africans in the countryside or working in the mines, maintained that Africans were by nature a rural\npeople, ill suited for city life. Alexandra, despite its problems and flaws, gave the lie to that argument. Its population, drawn from all African language\ngroups, was well adapted to city life and politically conscious. Urban life tended to abrade tribal and ethnic distinctions, and instead of being\nXhosas, or Sothos, or Zulus, or Shangaans, we were Alexandrians. This created a sense of solidarity, which caused great concern among the\nwhite authorities. The government had always utilized divide-and-rule tactics when dealing with Africans and depended on the strength of ethnic\ndivisions among the people. But in places like Alexandra, these differences were being erased.\nAlexandra occupies a treasured place in my heart. It was the first place I ever lived away from home. Even though I was later to live in Orlando, a\nsmall section of Soweto, for a far longer period than I did in Alexandra, I always regarded Alexandra Township as a home where I had no specific\nhouse, and Orlando as a place where I had a house but no home.\nIn that first year, I learned more about poverty than I did in all my childhood days in Qunu. I never seemed to have money and I managed to survive\non the meagerest of resources. The law firm paid me a salary of two pounds per week, having generously waived the premium the articled clerks\nnormally paid the firm. Out of that two pounds, I paid thirteen shillings and fourpence a month for my room at the Xhomas\u2019. The cheapest means of\ntransport to and from Alexandra was the \u201cNative\u201d bus \u2014 for Africans only \u2014 which at one pound tenpence a month made a considerable dent in my\nincome. I was also paying fees to the University of South Africa in order to complete my degree by correspondence. I spent another pound or so on\nfood. Part of my salary was spent on an even more vital item \u2014 candles \u2014 for without them I could not study. I could not afford a kerosene lamp;\ncandles allowed me to read late into the night.\nI was inevitably short more than a few pence each month. Many days I walked the six miles to town in the morning and the six back in the evening\nin order to save bus fare. I often went days without more than a mouthful of food, and without a change of clothing. Mr. Sidelsky, who was my height,\nonce gave me an old suit of his and, assisted by considerable stitching and patching, I wore that suit every day for almost five years. In the end,\nthere were more patches than suit.\nOne afternoon, I was returning to Alexandra by bus and took a seat next to another fellow about my age. He was one of those young men who\naffected a style of dress that mimicked the well-tailored gangsters in American movies. I realized that my suit was just touching the hem of his\njacket. He noticed it also and very carefully moved away so that my jacket would not sully his. It was a tiny gesture, comical in retrospect, but painful\nat the time.\nThere is little favorable to be said about poverty, but it was often an incubator of true friendship. Many people will appear to befriend you when\nyou are wealthy, but precious few will do the same when you are poor. If wealth is a magnet, poverty is a kind of repellent. Yet, poverty often brings\nout the true generosity in others. One morning, I decided to walk to town to save money and spotted a young lady who had been with me at Fort\nHare. Her name was Phyllis Maseko and she was walking toward me on the same side of the street. I was embarrassed by my threadbare clothing\nand crossed to the other side hoping she would not recognize me. But I heard her call out, \u201cNelson . . . Nelson!\u201d I stopped and crossed over,\npretending that I had not noticed her until that moment. She was pleased to see me, but I could tell that she observed how shabby I looked. \u201cNelson,\u201d\nshe said, \u201chere is my address,  Orlando East. Come and visit me.\u201d I resolved not to humiliate myself again, but one day I was in need of a\nproper meal and dropped by. She fed me without alluding to my poverty, and from then on I continued to visit her.\nMy landlord, Mr. Xhoma, was not wealthy, but he was a kind of philanthropist. Every Sunday, for all of the time I lived on his property, he and his\nwife gave me lunch, and those steaming plates of pork and vegetables were often my only hot meal of the week. No matter where I was or what I\nwas doing, I would never fail to be at the Xhomas\u2019 on Sunday. For the rest of the week, I would sustain myself on bread, and sometimes the\nsecretaries at the firm would bring me some food.\nI was very backward in those days and the combination of poverty and provincialism made for some amusing incidents. One day, not long after I\nhad moved in with the Xhomas, I was on my way home from Johannesburg and very hungry. I had a bit of money that I had saved and decided to\nsplurge on some fresh meat, something I had not had in a long time. I did not see a proper butcher around, so I went into a delicatessen, a type of\nshop I had never encountered until I went to Johannesburg. Through the glass, I saw a large and appetizing piece of meat and asked the man\nbehind the counter to carve off a piece. He wrapped it up, and I put it under my arm and headed home, dreaming of the dinner that awaited me.\nWhen I returned to my room in Alexandra, I called to one of the young daughters in the main house. She was only seven, but a clever girl. I said to\nher, \u201cWould you take this piece of meat to one of your older sisters and ask her to cook it for me?\u201d I could see her trying to suppress a smile, but\nshe was too respectful of her elders to laugh. With some irritation, I asked her whether something was wrong. Very softly, she said, \u201cThis meat is\ncooked.\u201d I asked her what she was talking about. She explained that I had bought a piece of smoked ham, and that it was meant to be eaten just as\nit was. This was entirely new to me, and rather than confess complete ignorance, I told her that I knew it was smoked ham but that I wanted it\nwarmed up. She knew I was bluffing, but ran off anyway. The meat was very tasty.\nIn Alexandra I rekindled a friendship with the lively, ever-cheerful Ellen Nkabinde, whom I had known from Healdtown, and who was then teaching\nat one of the township schools. In fact, Ellen and I fell in love. I had known her only slightly at Healdtown, and it was not until I saw her again in\nAlexandra that our relationship blossomed. What little spare time I had in those months I spent with Ellen. Courtship was difficult; we were always\n\n\fsurrounded by people, and there were few places to go. The only place we could be alone was outside under the sun or the stars. So, Ellen and I\nwandered together in the veld and hills surrounding the township. Mostly, we would just walk, and when we both had the time, we might have a\npicnic.\nEllen was a Swazi, and though tribalism was fading in the township, a close friend of mine condemned our relationship on purely tribal grounds. I\ncategorically rejected this. But our different backgrounds posed certain problems. Mrs. Mabutho, the reverend\u2019s wife, did not care for Ellen, largely\nbecause she was a Swazi. One day, while I was at the Mabuthos\u2019, Mrs. Mabutho answered a knock at the door. It was Ellen, who was looking for\nme, and Mrs. Mabutho told her I was not inside. Only later did Mrs. Mabutho say to me, \u201cOh, Nelson, some girl was here looking for you.\u201d Mrs.\nMabutho then said to me, \u201cIs that girl a Shangaan?\u201d Although the Shangaans are a proud and noble tribe, at the time, Shangaan was considered a\nderogatory term. I took offense at this and I said, \u201cNo, she is not a Shangaan, she is a Swazi.\u201d Mrs. Mabutho felt strongly that I should take out only\nXhosa girls.\nSuch advice did not deter me. I loved and respected Ellen, and felt not a little bit noble in discarding the counsel of those who disapproved. The\nrelationship was to me a novelty, and I felt daring in having a friendship with a woman who was not a Xhosa. I was young and a bit lost in the city,\nand Ellen played the role not only of romantic partner, but of a mother, supporting me, giving me confidence, and endowing me with strength and\nhope. But within a few months Ellen moved away, and sadly, we lost touch with one another.\nThe Xhoma family had five daughters, each of them lovely, but the loveliest of all was named Didi. Didi was about my age and spent most of the\nweek working as a domestic worker in a white suburb of Johannesburg. When I first moved to the house, I saw her only seldom and fleetingly. But\nlater, when I made her acquaintance properly, I also fell in love with her. But Didi barely took any notice of me, and what she did notice was the fact\nthat I owned only one patched-up suit and a single shirt, and that I did not present a figure much different from a tramp.\nEvery weekend Didi returned to Alexandra. She was brought home by a young man who I assumed was her boyfriend, a flashy, well-to-do fellow\nwho had a car, something that was most unusual. He wore expensive, double-breasted American suits and wide-brimmed hats, and paid a great\ndeal of attention to his appearance. He must have been a gangster of some sort, but I cannot be sure. He would stand outside in the yard and put\nhis hands in his waistcoat and look altogether superior. He greeted me politely, but I could see that he did not regard me as much competition.\nI yearned to tell Didi I loved her, but I was afraid that my advances would be unwanted. I was hardly a Don Juan. Awkward and hesitant around\ngirls, I did not know or understand the romantic games that others seemed to play effortlessly. On weekends, Didi\u2019s mother would sometimes ask\nher to bring out a plate of food to me. Didi would arrive on my doorstep with the plate and I could tell that she simply wanted to perform her errand\nas quickly as possible, but I would do my best to delay her. I would query her opinion on things, ask her all sorts of questions. \u201cNow, what standard\ndid you attain in school?\u201d I would say. Standard five, she replied. \u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d I asked. She was bored, she replied. \u201cAh, well, you must go\nback to school,\u201d I said. \u201cYou are about the same age as I am,\u201d I continued, \u201cand there is nothing wrong with returning to school at this age. Otherwise\nyou will regret it when you are old. You must think seriously about your future. It is nice for you now because you are young and beautiful and have\nmany admirers, but you need to have an independent profession.\u201d\nI realize that these are not the most romantic words that have ever been uttered by a young man to a young woman with whom he was in love, but\nI did not know what else to talk to her about. She listened seriously, but I could tell that she was not interested in me, that in fact she felt a bit\nsuperior to me.\nI wanted to propose to her but I was unwilling to do so unless I was certain she would say yes. Although I loved her, I did not want to give her the\nsatisfaction of rejecting me. I kept up my pursuit of her, but I was timid and hesitant. In love, unlike politics, caution is not usually a virtue. I was\nneither confident enough to think that I might succeed nor secure enough to bear the sense of failure if I did not.\nI stayed at that house for about a year, and in the end, I uttered nothing about my feelings. Didi did not show any less interest in her boyfriend or\nany more interest in me. I bade her good-bye with expressions of gratitude for her friendliness and the hospitality of the family. I did not see Didi\nagain for many years. One day, much later, when I was practicing law in Johannesburg, a young woman and her mother walked into my office. The\nwoman had had a child, and her boyfriend did not want to marry her; she was seeking to institute an action against him. That young woman was\nDidi, only now she looked haggard and wore a faded dress. I was distressed to see her, and thought how things might have turned out differently. In\nthe end, she did not bring a suit against her boyfriend, and I never saw her again.\nDespite my romantic deficiencies, I gradually adjusted to township life, and began to develop a sense of inner strength, a belief that I could do\nwell outside the world in which I had grown up. I slowly discovered I did not have to depend on my royal connections or the support of family in order\nto advance, and I forged relationships with people who did not know or care about my link to the Thembu royal house. I had my own home, humble\nthough it was, and I was developing the confidence and self-reliance necessary to stand on my own two feet.\n\nAt the end of , I received word that the regent was visiting Johannesburg and wanted to see me. I was nervous, but knew that I was obligated\nto see him, and indeed wanted to do so. He was staying at the WNLA compound, the headquarters of the Witwatersrand Native Labor Association,\nthe recruiting agency for mine-workers along the Reef.\nThe regent seemed greatly changed, or perhaps it was I who had changed. He never once mentioned the fact that I had run away, Fort Hare, or\nthe arranged marriage that was not to be. He was courteous and solicitous, questioning me in a fatherly way about my studies and future plans. He\nrecognized that my life was starting in earnest and would take a different course from the one he had envisaged and planned for. He did not try to\ndissuade me from my course, and I was grateful for this implicit acknowledgment that I was no longer his charge.\nMy meeting with the regent had a double effect. I had rehabilitated myself and at the same time restored my own regard for him and the Thembu\nroyal house. I had become indifferent to my old connections, an attitude I had adopted in part to justify my flight and somehow alleviate the pain of\nmy separation from a world I loved and valued. It was reassuring to be back in the regent\u2019s warm embrace.\nWhile the regent seemed satisfied with me, he was vexed with Justice, who he said must return to Mqhekezweni. Justice had formed a liaison\nwith a young woman, and I knew he had no intention of going home. After the regent departed, Bangindawo, one of his headmen, instituted\nproceedings against Justice, and I agreed to help Justice when he was called before the native commissioner. At the hearing, I pointed out that\nJustice was an adult, and was not obligated to return to Mqhekezweni merely because his father ordered it. When Bangindawo spoke, he did not\nreply to my argument but played on my own loyalties. He addressed me as Madiba, my clan name, something that was well calculated to remind\nme of my Thembu heritage. \u201cMadiba,\u201d he said, \u201cthe regent has cared for you, educated you, and treated you like his own son. Now you want to keep\nhis true son from him. This is contrary to the wishes of the man who has been your faithful guardian, and contrary to the path that has been laid out\nfor Justice.\u201d\nBangindawo\u2019s speech hit me hard. Justice did have a different destiny from that of myself. He was the son of a chief, and a future chief in his own\nright. After the hearing, I told Justice that I had changed my mind, and that I thought he should return. Justice was mystified by my reaction and\nrefused to listen to me. He resolved to stay and must have informed his girlfriend of my advice, for she never thereafter spoke to me.\n\n\fAt the beginning of , in order to save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, I moved from the room at the back of the Xhomas\u2019 to\nthe WNLA compound. I was assisted by Mr. Festile, the induna at the Chamber of Mines, who was once again playing a fateful role in my life. On\nhis own initiative he had decided to offer me free accommodation in the mining compound.\nThe WNLA compound was a multiethnic, polyglot community of modern, urban South Africa. There were Sothos, Tswanas, Vendas, Zulus, Pedis,\nShangaans, Namibians, Mozambicans, Swazis, and Xhosas. Few spoke English, and the lingua franca was an amalgam of many tongues known\nas Fanagalo. There, I saw not only flare-ups of ethnic animosity, but the comity that was also possible among men of different backgrounds. Yet I\nwas a fish out of water there. Instead of spending my days underground, I was studying or working in a law office where the only physical activity\nwas running errands or putting files in a cabinet.\nBecause the WNLA was a way station for visiting chiefs, I had the privilege of meeting tribal leaders from all over southern Africa. I recall on one\noccasion meeting the queen regent of Basutoland, or what is now Lesotho, Mantsebo Moshweshwe. She was accompanied by two chiefs, both of\nwhom knew Sabata\u2019s father, Jongilizwe. I asked them about Jongilizwe, and for an hour I seemed to be back in Thembuland as they told colorful\ntales about his early years.\nThe queen took special notice of me and at one point addressed me directly, but she spoke in Sesotho, a language in which I knew few words.\nSesotho is the language of the Sotho people as well as the Tswana, a large number of whom live in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. She\nlooked at me with incredulity, and then said in English, \u201cWhat kind of lawyer and leader will you be who cannot speak the language of your own\npeople?\u201d I had no response. The question embarrassed and sobered me; it made me realize my parochialism and just how unprepared I was for\nthe task of serving my people. I had unconsciously succumbed to the ethnic divisions fostered by the white government and I did not know how to\nspeak to my own kith and kin. Without language, one cannot talk to people and understand them; one cannot share their hopes and aspirations,\ngrasp their history, appreciate their poetry, or savor their songs. I again realized that we were not different people with separate languages; we\nwere one people, with different tongues.\n\nLess than six months after the regent\u2019s visit, Justice and I learned of his father\u2019s death in the winter of . He had seemed weary when last I saw\nhim, and his death did not come as a great surprise. We read of the regent\u2019s death in the newspaper because the telegram that had been sent to\nJustice had gone astray. We hastened down to the Transkei, arriving the day after the regent\u2019s funeral.\nThough I was disappointed to miss the regent\u2019s burial, I was inwardly glad that I had reconciled with him before his death. But I was not without\nstabs of guilt. I always knew, even when I was estranged from the regent, that all my friends might desert me, all my plans might founder, all my\nhopes be dashed, but the regent would never abandon me. Yet I had spurned him, and I wondered whether my desertion might have hastened his\ndeath.\nThe passing of the regent removed from the scene an enlightened and tolerant man who achieved the goal that marks the reign of all great\nleaders: he kept his people united. Liberals and conservatives, traditionalists and reformers, white-collar officials and blue-collar miners, all\nremained loyal to him, not because they always agreed with him, but because the regent listened to and respected all different opinions.\nI spent nearly a week in Mqhekezweni after the funeral and it was a time of retrospection and rediscovery. There is nothing like returning to a\nplace that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered. The Great Place went on as before, no different from when I had\ngrown up there. But I realized that my own outlook and worldviews had evolved. I was no longer attracted by a career in the civil service, or being an\ninterpreter in the Native Affairs Department. I no longer saw my future bound up with Thembuland and the Transkei. I was even informed that my\nXhosa was no longer pure and was now influenced by Zulu, one of the dominant languages in the Reef. My life in Johannesburg, my exposure to\nmen like Gaur Radebe, my experiences at the law firm, had radically altered my beliefs. I looked back on that young man who had left Mqhekezweni\nas a naive and parochial fellow who had seen very little of the world. I now believed I was seeing things as they were. That too, of course, was an\nillusion.\nI still felt an inner conflict between my head and my heart. My heart told me that I was a Thembu, that I had been raised and sent to school so that I\ncould play a special role in perpetuating the kingship. Had I no obligations to the dead? To my father, who had put me in the care of the regent? To\nthe regent himself, who had cared for me like a father? But my head told me that it was the right of every man to plan his own future as he pleased\nand choose his role in life. Was I not permitted to make my own choices?\nJustice\u2019s circumstances were different from my own, and after the regent\u2019s death he had important new responsibilities thrust upon him. He was\nto succeed the regent as chief and had decided to remain in Mqhekezweni and take up his birthright. I had to return to Johannesburg, and I could\nnot even stay to attend his installation. In my language there is a saying: \u201cNdiwelimilambo enamagama\u201d (I have crossed famous rivers). It means\nthat one has traveled a great distance, that one has had wide experience and gained some wisdom from it. I thought of this as I returned to\nJohannesburg alone. I had, since , crossed many important rivers in my own land: the Mbashe and the Great Kei, on my way to Healdtown;\nand the Orange and the Vaal, on my way to Johannesburg. But I had many rivers yet to cross.\n\nAt the end of  I passed the final examination for my B.A. degree. I had now achieved the rank I once considered so exalted. I was proud to\nhave achieved my B.A., but I also knew that the degree itself was neither a talisman nor a passport to easy success.\nAt the firm, I had become closer to Gaur, much to Mr. Sidelsky\u2019s exasperation. Education, Gaur argued, was essential to our advancement, but\nhe pointed out that no people or nation had ever freed itself through education alone. \u201cEducation is all well and good,\u201d Gaur said, \u201cbut if we are to\ndepend on education, we will wait a thousand years for our freedom. We are poor, we have few teachers and even fewer schools. We do not even\nhave the power to educate ourselves.\u201d\nGaur believed in finding solutions rather than in spouting theory. For Africans, he asserted, the engine of change was the African National\nCongress; its policies were the best way to pursue power in South Africa. He stressed the ANC\u2019s long history of advocating change, noting that the\nANC was the oldest national African organization in the country, having been founded in . Its constitution denounced racialism, its presidents\nhad been from different tribal groups, and it preached the goal of Africans as full citizens of South Africa.\nDespite Gaur\u2019s lack of formal education, he was my superior in virtually every sphere of knowledge. During lunch breaks he would often give\nimpromptu lectures; he loaned me books to read, recommended people for me to talk to, meetings for me to attend. I had taken two courses in\nmodern history at Fort Hare, and while I knew many facts, Gaur was able to explain the causes for particular actions, the reasons that men and\nnations had acted as they did. I felt as though I was learning history afresh.\n\n\fWhat made the deepest impression on me was Gaur\u2019s total commitment to the freedom struggle. He lived and breathed the quest for liberation.\nGaur sometimes attended several meetings a day where he featured prominently as a speaker. He seemed to think of nothing but revolution.\nI went along with Gaur to meetings of both the Township Advisory Board and the ANC. I went as an observer, not a participant, for I do not think I\never spoke. I wanted to understand the issues under discussion, evaluate the arguments, see the caliber of the men involved. The Advisory Board\nmeetings were perfunctory and bureaucratic, but the ANC meetings were lively with debate and discussion about Parliament, the pass laws, rents,\nbus fares \u2014 any subject under the sun that affected Africans.\nIn August , I marched with Gaur, and ten thousand others, in support of the Alexandra bus boycott, a protest against the raising of fares from\nfourpence to five. Gaur was one of the leaders and I watched him in action. This campaign had a great effect on me. In a small way, I had departed\nfrom my role as an observer and become a participant. I found that to march with one\u2019s people was exhilarating and inspiring. But I was also\nimpressed by the boycott\u2019s effectiveness: after nine days, during which the buses ran empty, the company returned the fare to fourpence.\n\nGaur\u2019s views were not the only ones I paid attention to at the firm. Hans Muller was a white estate agent who did business with Mr. Sidelsky and\nwould engage me in discussion. He was the prototypical businessman who saw the world through the prism of supply and demand. One day, Mr.\nMuller pointed out the window. \u201cLook out there, Nelson,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you see those men and women scurrying up and down the street? What is it\nthat they are pursuing? What is it they are working for so feverishly? I\u2019ll tell you: all of them, without exception, are after wealth and money. Because\nwealth and money equal happiness. That is what you must struggle for: money, and nothing but money. Once you have enough cash, there is\nnothing else you will want in life.\u201d\nWilliam Smith was a Coloured man involved in the African real estate trade who was often around the office. Smith was a veteran of the ICU (the\nIndustrial and Commercial Workers Union), South Africa\u2019s first black trade union, founded by Clements Kadalie, but his views had shifted\ndramatically since those days. \u201cNelson,\u201d he said, \u201cI have been involved in politics for a long time, and I regret every minute of it. I wasted the best\nyears of my life in futile efforts serving vain and selfish men who placed their interests above those of the people they pretended to serve. Politics, in\nmy experience, is nothing but a racket to steal money from the poor.\u201d\nMr. Sidelsky did not join these discussions. He seemed to regard discussing politics as almost as much of a waste of time as participating in it.\nAgain and again, he would counsel me to avoid politics. He warned me about Gaur and Walter Sisulu. These men will poison your mind, he said.\n\u201cNelson,\u201d he asked, \u201cyou want to be a lawyer, don\u2019t you?\u201d I said yes. \u201cAnd if you are a lawyer, you want to be a successful lawyer, do you not?\u201d\nAgain, I said yes. \u201cWell, if you get into politics,\u201d he said, \u201cyour practice will suffer. You will get into trouble with the authorities who are often your\nallies in your work. You will lose all your clients, you will go bankrupt, you will break up your family, and you will end up in jail. That is what will happen\nif you go into politics.\u201d\nI listened to these men and weighed their views carefully. All of the arguments had some merit. I was already leaning toward some type of\npolitical involvement, but I did not know what or how, and I lingered on the sidelines, uncertain what to do.\nAs far as my profession was concerned, it was Gaur who did more than just offer advice. One day in early , when I had been at the firm for\nless than two years, Gaur took me aside and said, \u201cMy boy, as long as I am here at the firm, they will never article you, whether or not you have a\ndegree.\u201d I was startled, and told Gaur that it could not be true, as he was not even in training to be a lawyer. \u201cThat does not make a difference,\nNelson,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey will say, \u2018We have Gaur, he can speak law to our people, why do we need someone else? Gaur is already bringing in\nclients to the firm.\u2019 But they will not tell you this to your face; they will just postpone and delay. It is important to the future of our struggle in this country\nfor you to become a lawyer, and so I am going to leave the firm and start my own estate agency. When I am gone, they will have no choice but to\narticle you.\u201d\nI pleaded with him not to resign, but he was immovable. Within a few days, he gave Mr. Sidelsky his resignation, and Mr. Sidelsky eventually\narticled me as promised. I cannot say whether Gaur\u2019s absence had anything at all to do with it, but his resignation was another example of his\ngenerosity.\n\nEarly in , after passing my examination through UNISA, I returned to Fort Hare for my graduation. Before leaving for the university, I decided to\noutfit myself in a proper suit. In order to do so, I had to borrow the money from Walter Sisulu. I had had a new suit when I went up to Fort Hare,\npurchased for me by the regent, and now I would have a new suit when I went down. I borrowed academic dress from Randall Peteni, a friend and\nfellow alumnus.\nMy nephew, K. D. Matanzima, who had graduated several years before, drove my mother and No-England, the regent\u2019s widow, to the ceremony. I\nwas gratified to have my mother there, but the fact that No-England came made it seem as though the regent himself had blessed the event.\nAfter the graduation, I spent a few days with Daliwonga (K.D.\u2019s clan name, which is what I called him), at his home in Qamata. Daliwonga had\nalready chosen the path of traditional leadership. He was in the line of succession to become the head of Emigrant Thembuland, which lies in the\nwesternmost part of the Transkei, and while I was staying with him he pressed me to return to Umtata after qualifying as an attorney. \u201cWhy do you\nstay in Johannesburg?\u201d he said. \u201cYou are needed more here.\u201d\nIt was a fair point; there were certainly more professional Africans in the Transvaal than in the Transkei. I told Daliwonga that his suggestions\nwere premature. But in my heart, I knew I was moving toward a different commitment. Through my friendship with Gaur and Walter, I was beginning\nto see that my duty was to my people as a whole, not just a particular section or branch. I felt that all the currents in my life were taking me away from\nthe Transkei and toward what seemed like the center, a place where regional and ethnic loyalties gave way before a common purpose.\nThe graduation at Fort Hare offered a moment of introspection and reflection. I was struck most forcefully by the discrepancy between my old\nassumptions and my actual experience. I had discarded my presumptions that graduates automatically became leaders and that my connection to\nthe Thembu royal house guaranteed me respect. Having a successful career and a comfortable salary were no longer my ultimate goals. I found\nmyself being drawn into the world of politics because I was not content with my old beliefs.\nIn Johannesburg, I moved in circles where common sense and practical experience were more important than high academic qualifications.\nEven as I was receiving my degree, I realized that hardly anything I had learned at university seemed relevant in my new environment. At the\nuniversity, teachers had shied away from topics like racial oppression, lack of opportunities for Africans, and the nest of laws and regulations that\nsubjugate the black man. But in my life in Johannesburg, I confronted these things every day. No one had ever suggested to me how to go about\nremoving the evils of racial prejudice, and I had to learn by trial and error.\n\n\fWhen I returned to Johannesburg at the beginning of , I enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand for an LL.B., a bachelor of laws degree,\nthe preparatory academic training for a lawyer. The University of the Witwatersrand, known to all as \u201cWits,\u201d is located in Braamfontein in northcentral Johannesburg, and is considered by many to be the premier English-speaking university in South Africa.\nWhile working at the law firm brought me into regular contact with whites for the first time, the university introduced me to a group of whites my\nown age. At Fort Hare we had occasional contacts with white students from Rhodes University in Grahamstown, but at Wits, I was attending\nclasses with white students. This was as new to them as it was to me, for I was the only African student in the law faculty.\nThe English-speaking universities of South Africa were great incubators of liberal values. It was a tribute to these institutions that they allowed\nblack students. For the Afrikaans universities, such a thing was unthinkable.\nDespite the university\u2019s liberal values, I never felt entirely comfortable there. Always to be the only African, except for menial workers, to be\nregarded at best as a curiosity and at worst as an interloper, is not a congenial experience. My manner was guarded, and I met both generosity and\nanimosity. Although I was to discover a core of sympathetic whites who became friends and later colleagues, most of the whites at Wits were not\nliberal or color-blind. I recall getting to a lecture a few minutes late one day and taking a seat next to Sarel Tighy, a classmate who later became a\nmember of Parliament for the United Party. Though the lecture had already started and there were only a few empty seats, he ostentatiously\ncollected his things and moved to a seat distant from me. This type of behavior was the rule rather than the exception. No one uttered the word\nkaffir; their hostility was more muted, but I felt it just the same.\nOur law professor, Mr. Hahlo, was a strict, cerebral sort, who did not tolerate much independence on the part of his students. He held a curious\nview of the law when it came to women and Africans: neither group, he said, was meant to be lawyers. His view was that law was a social science\nand that women and Africans were not disciplined enough to master its intricacies. He once told me that I should not be at Wits but studying for my\ndegree through UNISA. Although I disagreed with his views, I did little to disprove them. My performance as a law student was dismal.\nAt Wits, I met many people who were to share with me the ups and downs of the liberation struggle, and without whom I would have\naccomplished very little. Many white students went out of their way to make me feel welcome. During my first term at Wits I met Joe Slovo and his\nfuture wife, Ruth First. Then as now, Joe had one of the sharpest, most incisive minds I have ever encountered. He was an ardent Communist, and\nwas known for his high-spirited parties. Ruth had an outgoing personality and was a gifted writer. Both were the children of Jewish immigrants to\nSouth Africa. I began lifelong friendships with George Bizos and Bram Fischer. George, the child of Greek immigrants, was a man who combined a\nsympathetic nature with an incisive mind. Bram Fischer, a part-time lecturer, was the scion of a distinguished Afrikaner family: his grandfather had\nbeen prime minister of the Orange River Colony and his father was judge-president of the Orange Free State. Although he could have been a prime\nminister of South Africa, he became one of the bravest and staunchest friends of the freedom struggle that I have ever known. I befriended Tony\nO\u2019Dowd and Harold Wolpe, who were political radicals and members of the Communist Party, and Jules Browde and his wife, who were liberal\nchampions of the anti-apartheid cause.\nI also formed close friendships with a number of Indian students. Although there had been a handful of Indian students at Fort Hare, they stayed in\na separate hostel and I seldom had contact with them. At Wits I met and became friends with Ismail Meer, J. N. Singh, Ahmed Bhoola, and Ramlal\nBhoolia. The center of this tight-knit community was Ismail\u2019s apartment, flat , Kholvad House, four rooms in a residential building in the center of\nthe city. There we studied, talked, and even danced until the early hours in the morning, and it became a kind of headquarters for young freedom\nfighters. I sometimes slept there when it was too late to catch the last train back to Orlando.\nBright and serious, Ismail Meer was born in Natal, and while at law school at Wits he became a key member of the Transvaal Indian Congress. J.\nN. Singh was a popular, handsome fellow, who was at ease with all colors and also a member of the Communist Party. One day, Ismail, J.N., and\nmyself were in a rush to get to Kholvad House, and we boarded the tram despite the fact that while Indians were allowed, Africans were not. We\nhad not been on long when the conductor turned to Ismail and J.N. and said in Afrikaans that their \u201ckaffir friend\u201d was not allowed on. Ismail and J.N.\nexploded at the conductor, telling him that he did not even understand the word kaffir and that it was offensive to call me that name. The conductor\npromptly stopped the tram and hailed a policeman, who arrested us, took us down to the station, and charged us. We were ordered to appear in\ncourt the following day. That night, Ismail and J.N. arranged for Bram Fischer to defend us. The next day, the magistrate seemed in awe of Bram\u2019s\nfamily connections. We were promptly acquitted and I saw firsthand that justice was not at all blind.\nWits opened a new world to me, a world of ideas and political beliefs and debates, a world where people were passionate about politics. I was\namong white and Indian intellectuals of my own generation, young men who would form the vanguard of the most important political movements of\nthe next few years. I discovered for the first time people of my own age firmly aligned with the liberation struggle, who were prepared, despite their\nrelative privilege, to sacrifice themselves for the cause of the oppressed. I CANNOT PINPOINT a moment when I became politicized, when I knew that I would spend my life in the liberation struggle. To be an African in\nSouth Africa means that one is politicized from the moment of one\u2019s birth, whether one acknowledges it or not. An African child is born in an\nAfricans Only hospital, taken home in an Africans Only bus, lives in an Africans Only area, and attends Africans Only schools, if he attends school at\nall.\nWhen he grows up, he can hold Africans Only jobs, rent a house in Africans Only townships, ride Africans Only trains, and be stopped at any time\nof the day or night and be ordered to produce a pass, failing which he will be arrested and thrown in jail. His life is circumscribed by racist laws and\nregulations that cripple his growth, dim his potential, and stunt his life. This was the reality, and one could deal with it in a myriad of ways.\nI had no epiphany, no singular revelation, no moment of truth, but a steady accumulation of a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand\nunremembered moments, produced in me an anger, a rebelliousness, a desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people. There was no\nparticular day on which I said, From henceforth I will devote myself to the liberation of my people; instead, I simply found myself doing so, and could\nnot do otherwise.\nI have mentioned many of the people who influenced me, but more and more, I had come under the wise tutelage of Walter Sisulu. Walter was\nstrong, reasonable, practical, and dedicated. He never lost his head in a crisis; he was often silent when others were shouting. He believed that the\nANC was the means to effect change in South Africa, the repository of black hopes and aspirations. Sometimes one can judge an organization by\nthe people who belong to it, and I knew that I would be proud to belong to any organization in which Walter was a member. At the time, there were\nfew alternatives. The ANC was the one organization that welcomed everyone, that saw itself as a great umbrella under which all Africans could find\nshelter.\nChange was in the air in the s. The Atlantic Charter of , signed by Roosevelt and Churchill, reaffirmed faith in the dignity of each human\nbeing and propagated a host of democratic principles. Some in the West saw the charter as empty promises, but not those of us in Africa. Inspired\nby the Atlantic Charter and the fight of the Allies against tyranny and oppression, the ANC created its own charter, called African Claims, which\ncalled for full citizenship for all Africans, the right to buy land, and the repeal of all discriminatory legislation. We hoped that the government and\nordinary South Africans would see that the principles they were fighting for in Europe were the same ones we were advocating at home.\n\nWalter\u2019s house in Orlando was a mecca for activists and ANC members. It was a warm, welcoming place and I was often there either to sample a\npolitical discussion or MaSisulu\u2019s cooking. One night in  I met Anton Lembede, who held master of arts and bachelor of law degrees, and A.\nP. Mda. From the moment I heard Lembede speak, I knew I was seeing a magnetic personality who thought in original and often startling ways. He\nwas then one of a handful of African lawyers in all of South Africa and was the legal partner of the venerable Dr. Pixley ka Seme, one of the\nfounders of the ANC.\nLembede said that Africa was a black man\u2019s continent, and it was up to Africans to reassert themselves and reclaim what was rightfully theirs. He\nhated the idea of the black inferiority complex and castigated what he called the worship and idolization of the West and their ideas. The inferiority\ncomplex, he affirmed, was the greatest barrier to liberation. He noted that wherever the African had been given the opportunity, he was capable of\ndeveloping to the same extent as the white man, citing such African heroes as Marcus Garvey, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Haile Selassie. \u201cThe color of\nmy skin is beautiful,\u201d he said, \u201clike the black soil of Mother Africa.\u201d He believed blacks had to improve their own self-image before they could initiate\nsuccessful mass action. He preached self-reliance and self-determination, and called his philosophy Africanism. We took it for granted that one day\nhe would lead the ANC.\nLembede declared that a new spirit was stirring among the people, that ethnic differences were melting away, that young men and women\nthought of themselves as Africans first and foremost, not as Xhosas or Ndebeles or Tswanas. Lembede, whose father was an illiterate Zulu\npeasant from Natal, had trained as a teacher at Adam\u2019s College, an American Board of Missions institution. He had taught for years in the Orange\nFree State, learned Afrikaans, and came to see Afrikaner nationalism as a prototype of African nationalism.\nAs Lembede later wrote in the newspaper Inkundla ya Bantu, an African newspaper in Natal:\nThe history of modern times is the history of nationalism. Nationalism has been tested in the people\u2019s struggles and the fires of battle and found to be the only antidote against\nforeign rule and modern imperialism. It is for that reason that the great imperialistic powers feverishly endeavor with all their might to discourage and eradicate all nationalistic\ntendencies among their alien subjects; for that purpose huge and enormous sums of money are lavishly expended on propaganda against nationalism which is dismissed as\n\u201cnarrow,\u201d \u201cbarbarous,\u201d \u201cuncultured,\u201d \u201cdevilish,\u201d etc. Some alien subjects become dupes of this sinister propaganda and consequently become tools or instruments of imperialism\nfor which great service they are highly praised by the imperialistic power and showered with such epithets as \u201ccultured,\u201d \u201cliberal,\u201d \u201cprogressive,\u201d \u201cbroadminded,\u201d etc.\n\nLembede\u2019s views struck a chord in me. I, too, had been susceptible to paternalistic British colonialism and the appeal of being perceived by\nwhites as \u201ccultured\u201d and \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201ccivilized.\u201d I was already on my way to being drawn into the black elite that Britain sought to create in\nAfrica. That is what everyone from the regent to Mr. Sidelsky had wanted for me. But it was an illusion. Like Lembede, I came to see the antidote as\nmilitant African nationalism.\nLembede\u2019s friend and partner was Peter Mda, better known as A.P. While Lembede tended to imprecision and was inclined to be verbose, Mda\nwas controlled and exact. Lembede could be vague and mystical; Mda was specific and scientific. Mda\u2019s practicality was a perfect foil for\nLembede\u2019s idealism.\nOther young men were thinking along the same lines and we would all meet to discuss these ideas. In addition to Lembede and Mda, these men\nincluded Walter Sisulu; Oliver Tambo; Dr. Lionel Majombozi; Victor Mbobo, my former teacher at Healdtown; William Nkomo, a medical student\nwho was a member of the CP; Jordan Ngubane, a journalist from Natal who worked for Inkundla as well as the Bantu World, the largest-selling\nAfrican newspaper; David Bopape, secretary of the ANC in the Transvaal and member of the Communist Party; and many others. Many felt,\nperhaps unfairly, that the ANC as a whole had become the preserve of a tired, unmilitant, privileged African elite more concerned with protecting\ntheir own rights than those of the masses. The general consensus was that some action must be taken, and Dr. Majombozi proposed forming a\nYouth League as a way of lighting a fire under the leadership of the ANC.\nIn , a delegation including Lembede, Mda, Sisulu, Tambo, Nkomo, and myself went to see Dr. Xuma, who was head of the ANC, at his\nrather grand house in Sophiatown. Dr. Xuma had a surgery at his home in addition to a small farm. Dr. Xuma had performed a great service to the\nANC. He had roused it from its slumbering state under Dr. ka Seme, when the organization had shrunk in size and importance. When he assumed\nthe presidency, the ANC had seventeen shillings and sixpence in its treasury, and he had boosted the amount to four thousand pounds. He was\nadmired by traditional leaders, had relationships with cabinet ministers, and exuded a sense of security and confidence. But he also carried himself\n\n\fwith an air of superciliousness that did not befit the leader of a mass organization. As devoted as he was to the ANC, his medical practice took\nprecedence. Xuma presided over the era of delegations, deputations, letters, and telegrams. Everything was done in the English manner, the idea\nbeing that despite our disagreements we were all gentlemen. He enjoyed the relationships he had formed with the white establishment and did not\nwant to jeopardize them with political action.\nAt our meeting, we told him that we intended to organize a Youth League and a campaign of action designed to mobilize mass support. We had\nbrought a copy of the draft constitution and manifesto with us. We told Dr. Xuma that the ANC was in danger of becoming marginalized unless it\nstirred itself and took up new methods. Dr. Xuma felt threatened by our delegation and strongly objected to a Youth League constitution. He thought\nthe league should be a more loosely organized group and act mainly as a recruiting committee for the ANC. In a paternalistic way, Dr. Xuma went\non to tell us that Africans as a group were too unorganized and undisciplined to participate in a mass campaign and that such a campaign would\nbe rash and dangerous.\nShortly after the meeting with Dr. Xuma, a provisional committee of the Youth League was formed, under the leadership of William Nkomo. The\nmembers of the committee journeyed to the ANC annual conference in Bloemfontein in December of , where they proposed the formation of a\nYouth League to help recruit new members to the organization. The proposal was accepted.\nThe actual formation of the Youth League took place on Easter Sunday, , at the Bantu Men\u2019s Social Center on Eloff Street. There were\nabout one hundred men there, some coming from as far away as Pretoria. It was a select group, an elite group, a great number of us being Fort\nHare graduates; we were far from a mass movement. Lembede gave a lecture on the history of nations, a tour of the horizon from ancient Greece\nto medieval Europe to the age of colonization. He emphasized the historical achievements of Africa and Africans, and noted how foolish it was for\nwhites to see themselves as a chosen people and an intrinsically superior race.\nJordan Ngubane, A. P. Mda, and William Nkomo all spoke, and emphasized the emerging spirit of African nationalism. Lembede was elected\nthe president, Oliver Tambo, the secretary, and Walter Sisulu became the treasurer. A. P. Mda, Jordan Ngubane, Lionel Majombozi, Congress\nMbata, David Bopape, and I were elected to the executive committee. We were later joined by such prominent young men as Godfrey Pitje, a\nstudent (later teacher then lawyer); Arthur Letele, Wilson Conco, Diliza Mji, and Nthato Motlana, all medical doctors; Dan Tloome, a trade unionist;\nand Joe Matthews, Duma Nokwe, and Robert Sobukwe, all students. Branches were soon established in all the provinces.\nThe basic policy of the league did not differ from the ANC\u2019s first constitution in . But we were reaffirming and underscoring those original\nconcerns, many of which had gone by the wayside. African nationalism was our battle cry, and our creed was the creation of one nation out of many\ntribes, the overthrow of white supremacy, and the establishment of a truly democratic form of government. Our manifesto stated: \u201cWe believe that\nthe national liberation of Africans will be achieved by Africans themselves. . . . The Congress Youth League must be the brains-trust and powerstation of the spirit of African nationalism.\u201d\nThe manifesto utterly rejected the notion of trusteeship, the idea that the white government somehow had African interests at heart. We cited the\ncrippling, anti-African legislation of the past forty years, beginning with the  Land Act, which ultimately deprived blacks of  percent of the\nterritory in the land of their birth; the Urban Areas Act of , which created teeming African slums, politely called \u201cnative locations,\u201d in order to\nsupply cheap labor to white industry; the Color Bar Act of , which banned Africans from practicing skilled trades; the Native Administration Act\nof , which made the British Crown, rather than the paramount chiefs, the supreme chief over all African areas; and finally, in , the\nRepresentation of Natives Act, which removed Africans from the Common Voters\u2019 Roll in the Cape, thereby shattering any illusion that whites would\nallow Africans to have control over their own destiny.\nWe were extremely wary of communism. The document stated, \u201cWe may borrow . . . from foreign ideologies, but we reject the wholesale\nimportation of foreign ideologies into Africa.\u201d This was an implicit rebuke to the Communist Party, which Lembede and many others, including\nmyself, considered a \u201cforeign\u201d ideology unsuited to the African situation. Lembede felt that the Communist Party was dominated by whites, which\nundermined African self-confidence and initiative.\nA number of committees were formed that day, but the primary purpose of the Youth League was to give direction to the ANC in its quest for\npolitical freedom. Although I agreed with this, I was nervous about joining the league and still had doubts about the extent of my political\ncommitment. I was then working full-time and studying part-time, and had little time outside of those two activities. I also possessed a certain\ninsecurity, feeling politically backward compared to Walter, Lembede, and Mda. They were men who knew their minds, and I was, as yet, unformed.\nI still lacked confidence as a speaker, and was intimidated by the eloquence of so many of those in the league.\nLembede\u2019s Africanism was not universally supported because his ideas were characterized by a racial exclusivity that disturbed some of the\nother Youth Leaguers. Some of the Youth Leaguers felt that a nationalism that would include sympathetic whites was a more desirable course.\nOthers, including myself, countered that if blacks were offered a multiracial form of struggle, they would remain enamored of white culture and prey\nto a continuing sense of inferiority. At the time, I was firmly opposed to allowing Communists or whites to join the league.\n* * *\nWalter\u2019s house was my home away from home. For several months in the early s, it actually was my home when I had no other place to stay.\nThe house was always full, and it seemed there was a perpetual discussion going on about politics. Albertina, Walter\u2019s wife, was a wise and\nwonderful presence, and a strong supporter of Walter\u2019s political work. (At their wedding, Anton Lembede said: \u201cAlbertina, you have married a\nmarried man: Walter married politics long before he met you.\u201d)\nIt was in the lounge of the Sisulus\u2019 home that I met Evelyn Mase, my first wife. She was a quiet, pretty girl from the countryside who did not seem\noverawed by the comings and goings at the Sisulus\u2019. She was then training as a nurse with Albertina and Peter Mda\u2019s wife, Rose, at the\nJohannesburg non-European General Hospital.\nEvelyn was from Engcobo, in the Transkei, some distance west of Umtata. Her father, a mineworker, had died when she was an infant, and her\nmother when she was twelve. After completing grade school, Evelyn was sent to Johannesburg to attend high school. She stayed with her brother,\nSam Mase, who was then living at the Sisulus\u2019 house. MaSisulu, Walter\u2019s mother, was the sister of Evelyn\u2019s father\u2019s mother. The Sisulus treated\nEvelyn as if she was a favorite daughter, and she was much loved by them.\nI asked Evelyn out very soon after our first meeting. Almost as quickly, we fell in love. Within a few months I had asked her to marry me and she\naccepted. We were married in a civil ceremony requiring only signatures and a witness at the Native Commissioner\u2019s Court in Johannesburg, for\nwe could not afford a traditional wedding or feast. Our most immediate problem was finding a place to live. We first went to stay with her brother in\nOrlando East and then later with Evelyn\u2019s sister at City Deep Mines, where her sister\u2019s husband, Msunguli Mgudlwa, worked as a clerk.\n",
    "1946-1952": " IT WAS DAWN when we reached the offices of Crown Mines, which were located on the plateau of a great hill overlooking the still dark metropolis.\nJohannesburg was a city built up around the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in , and Crown Mines was the largest gold mine in the city\nof gold. I expected to see a grand building like the government offices in Umtata, but the Crown Mine offices were rusted tin shanties on the face of\nthe mine.\nThere is nothing magical about a gold mine. Barren and pockmarked, all dirt and no trees, fenced in all sides, a gold mine resembles a war-torn\nbattlefield. The noise was harsh and ubiquitous: the rasp of shaft-lifts, the jangling power drills, the distant rumble of dynamite, the barked orders.\nEverywhere I looked I saw black men in dusty overalls looking tired and bent. They lived on the grounds in bleak, single-sex barracks that contained\nhundreds of concrete bunks separated from each other by only a few inches.\nGold-mining on the Witwatersrand was costly because the ore was low grade and deep under the earth. Only the presence of cheap labor in the\nform of thousands of Africans working long hours for little pay with no rights made gold-mining profitable for the mining houses \u2014 white-owned\ncompanies that became wealthy beyond the dreams of Croesus on the backs of the African people. I had never seen such enterprise before, such\ngreat machines, such methodical organization, and such backbreaking work. It was my first sight of South African capitalism at work, and I knew I\nwas in for a new kind of education.\nWe went straight to the chief induna, or headman. His name was Piliso, a tough old fellow who had seen life at its most pitiless. Piliso knew\nabout Justice, as the regent had sent a letter months before making arrangements for him to receive a clerical job, the most coveted and respected\njob in the mine compound. I, however, was unknown to him. Justice explained that I was his brother.\n\u201cI was expecting only Justice,\u201d Piliso responded. \u201cYour father\u2019s letter mentions nothing about a brother.\u201d He looked me over rather skeptically. But\nJustice pleaded with him, saying it had simply been an oversight, and that the regent had already posted a letter about me. Piliso\u2019s crusty exterior\nhid a sympathetic side, and he took me on as a mine policeman, saying that if I worked out, he would give me a clerical post in three months\u2019 time.\nThe regent\u2019s word carried weight at Crown Mines. This was true of all chiefs in South Africa. Mining officials were eager to recruit labor in the\ncountryside, and the chiefs had authority over the men they needed. They wanted the chiefs to encourage their subjects to come to the Reef. The\nchiefs were treated with great deference; the mining houses provided special lodgings for them whenever they came to visit. One letter from the\nregent was enough to secure a man a good job, and Justice and I were treated with extra care because of our connection. We were to be given\nfree rations, sleeping quarters, and a small salary. We did not stay in the barracks that first night. For our first few days, Piliso, out of courtesy to the\nregent, invited Justice and me to stay with him.\nMany of the miners, especially those from Thembuland, treated Justice as a chief and greeted him with gifts of cash, the custom when a chief\nvisited a mine. Most of these men were in the same hostel; miners were normally housed according to tribe. The mining companies preferred such\nsegregation because it prevented different ethnic groups from uniting around a common grievance and reinforced the power of the chiefs. The\nseparation often resulted in factional fights between different ethnic groups and clans, which the companies did not effectively discourage.\nJustice shared some of his booty with me and gave me a few extra pounds as a bonus. For those first few days, my pockets jingling with\nnewfound riches, I felt like a millionaire. I was beginning to think I was a child of fortune, that luck was shining on me, and that if I had not wasted\nprecious time studying at college I could have been a wealthy man by then. Once again, I did not see that fate was busy setting snares around me.\nI started work immediately as a night watchman. I was given a uniform, a new pair of boots, a helmet, a flashlight, a whistle, and a knobkerrie,\nwhich is a long wooden stick with a heavy ball of wood at one end. The job was a simple one: I waited at the compound\u2019s entrance next to the sign\nthat read, \u201cBEWARE: NATIVES CROSSING HERE,\u201d and checked the credentials of all those entering and leaving. For the first few nights, I\npatrolled the grounds of the compound without incident. I did challenge a rather drunken miner late one evening, but he meekly showed his pass\nand retired to his hostel.\nFlushed with our success, Justice and I boasted of our cleverness to a friend of ours whom we knew from home, who was also working at the\nmines. We explained how we had run away and tricked the regent in the bargain. Although we swore this fellow to secrecy, he went straightaway to\nthe induna and revealed our secret. A day later, Piliso called us in and the first question he asked Justice was: Where is the permission from the\nregent for your brother? Justice said that he had already explained that the regent had posted it. Piliso was not mollified by this, and we sensed that\nsomething was wrong. He then reached inside his desk and produced a telegram. \u201cI have had a communication from the regent,\u201d he said in a\nserious tone of voice, and handed it to us. It contained a single sentence: \u201cSEND BOYS HOME AT ONCE.\u201d\nPiliso then vented his anger on us, accusing us of lying to him. He said we had presumed on his hospitality and the good name of the regent. He\ntold us that he was taking up a collection among the miners to put us on a train back to the Transkei. Justice protested against going home, saying\nthat we simply wanted to work at the mine, and that we could make decisions for ourselves. But Piliso turned a deaf ear. We felt ashamed and\nhumiliated, but we left his office determined not to return to the Transkei.\nWe rapidly hatched another plan. We went to see Dr. A. B. Xuma, an old friend of the regent\u2019s who was the president-general of the African\nNational Congress. Dr. Xuma was from the Transkei, and was an extremely well-respected physician.\n\nDr. Xuma was pleased to see us, and politely questioned us about family matters in Mqhekezweni. We told him a series of half-truths about why we\nwere in Johannesburg, and that we greatly desired jobs in the mines. Dr. Xuma said he would be glad to assist us, and immediately telephoned a\nMr. Wellbeloved at the Chamber of Mines, a powerful organization representing the mining houses and exerting monopoly control over the hiring of\nmine labor. Dr. Xuma told Mr. Wellbeloved what splendid fellows we were and how he should find places for us. We thanked Dr. Xuma and went off\nto see Mr. Wellbeloved.\nMr. Wellbeloved was a white man whose office was grander than any I had ever seen; his desk seemed as wide as a football field. We met him\nin the company of a mine boss named Festile, and we told him the same fabrications that we had told Dr. Xuma. Mr. Wellbeloved was impressed\nwith my not-entirely-truthful explanation that I had come to Johannesburg to continue my studies at the University of the Witwatersrand. \u201cWell, boys,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cI will put you in touch with the manager of Crown Mines, a Mr. Piliso, and I will tell him to give you jobs as clerks.\u201d He said he had worked\nwith Mr. Piliso for thirty years and in all that time, Piliso had never lied to him. Justice and I squirmed at this but said nothing. Despite some\nmisgivings, we naively felt we had the upper hand with Mr. Piliso now that we had his boss, Mr. Wellbeloved, on our side.\nWe returned to the Crown Mine offices, where the white compound manager was considerate to us because of the letter we presented from Mr.\nWellbeloved. Just then, Mr. Piliso passed by the office, saw us, and then stormed in. \u201cYou boys! You\u2019ve come back!\u201d he said with irritation. \u201cWhat\nare you doing here?\u201d\nJustice was calm. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sent by Mr. Wellbeloved,\u201d he replied, his tone bordering on defiance. Mr. Piliso considered this for a moment.\n\n\f\u201cDid you tell him that you ran away from your father?\u201d Piliso then countered. Justice was silent.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never be employed in any mine that I run!\u201d he yelled. \u201cNow, get out of my sight!\u201d Justice waved Wellbeloved\u2019s letter. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn\nabout a letter!\u201d Piliso said. I looked to the white manager, hoping that he might overrule Piliso, but he was as still as a statue and seemed as\nintimidated as we were. We had no rejoinder for Piliso, and we sheepishly walked out of the office, feeling even more humbled than we had on the\nfirst occasion.\nOur fortunes were now reversed. We were without jobs, without prospects, and without a place to stay. Justice knew various people in\nJohannesburg, and he went into town to investigate a place for us to stay. In the meantime, I was to fetch our suitcase, which was still at Piliso\u2019s,\nand then meet Justice at George Goch, a small township in southern Johannesburg, later that day.\nI prevailed upon a fellow named Bikitsha, whom I knew from home, to help me carry the suitcase to the front gate. A watchman at the gate\nstopped us both and said he needed to search the bag. Bikitsha protested, asserting there was no contraband in the suitcase. The watchman\nreplied that a search was routine, and he looked through the bag in a cursory way, not even disturbing the clothing. As the watchman was closing it,\nBikitsha, who was a cocky fellow, said, \u201cWhy do you make trouble? I told you there was nothing there.\u201d These words irked the watchman, who then\ndecided to search the case with a fine-toothed comb. I became increasingly nervous as he opened every compartment and probed every pocket.\nHe then reached all the way to the bottom of the case and found the very thing I prayed he would not: a loaded revolver wrapped inside some of my\nclothing.\nHe turned to my friend and said, \u201cYou are under arrest.\u201d He then blew his whistle, which brought a team of guards over to us. My friend looked at\nme with a mixture of consternation and confusion as they led him away to the local police station. I followed them at a distance, considering my\noptions. The gun, an old revolver, had been my father\u2019s and he had left it to me when he died. I had never used it, but as a precaution, I had brought\nit with me to the city.\nI could not let my friend take the blame in my stead. Not long after he had entered the police station, I went inside and asked to see the officer in\ncharge. I was taken to him and spoke as directly and forthrightly as I could: \u201cSir, that is my gun that was found in my friend\u2019s suitcase. I inherited it\nfrom my father in the Transkei and I brought it here because I was afraid of gangsters.\u201d I explained that I was a student from Fort Hare, and that I\nwas only in Johannesburg temporarily. The officer in charge softened a bit as I spoke, and said that he would release my friend straightaway. He\nsaid he would have to charge me for possession of the gun, though he would not arrest me, and that I should appear in court first thing on Monday\nmorning to answer the charge. I was grateful, and told him that I would certainly appear in court on Monday. I did go to court that Monday and\nreceived only a nominal fine.\nIn the meantime, I had arranged to stay with one of my cousins, Garlick Mbekeni, in George Goch Township. Garlick was a hawker who sold\nclothing, and had a small boxlike house. He was a friendly, solicitous man, and after I had been there a short while, I told him that my real aspiration\nwas to be a lawyer. He commended me for my ambition and said he would think about what I had said.\nA few days later, Garlick told me that he was taking me to see \u201cone of our best people in Johannesburg.\u201d We rode the train to the office of an\nestate agent on Market Street, a dense and rollicking thoroughfare with trams groaning with passengers, sidewalk vendors on every street, and a\nsense that wealth and riches were just around the next corner.\nJohannesburg in those days was a combination frontier town and modern city. Butchers cut meat on the street next to office buildings. Tents were\npitched beside bustling shops and women hung out their washing next door to high-rise buildings. Industry was energized due to the war effort. In\n, South Africa, a member of the British Commonwealth, had declared war on Nazi Germany. The country was supplying men and goods to the\nwar effort. Demand for labor was high, and Johannesburg became a magnet for Africans from the countryside seeking work. Between , when I\narrived, and , the number of Africans in the city would double. Every morning, the township felt larger than it had the day before. Men found jobs\nin factories and housing in the \u201cnon-European townships\u201d of Newclare, Martindale, George Goch, Alexandra, Sophiatown, and the Western Native\nTownship, a prisonlike compound of a few thousand matchbox houses on treeless ground.\nGarlick and I sat in the estate agent\u2019s waiting room while a pretty African receptionist announced our presence to her boss in the inner office.\nAfter she relayed the message, her nimble fingers danced across the keyboard as she typed a letter. I had never in my life seen an African typist\nbefore, much less a female one. In the few public and business offices that I had visited in Umtata and Fort Hare, the typists had always been white\nand male. I was particularly impressed with this young woman because those white male typists had only used two slow-moving fingers to peck out\ntheir letters.\nShe soon ushered us into the inner office, where I was introduced to a man who looked to be in his late twenties, with an intelligent and kindly\nface, light in complexion, and dressed in a double-breasted suit. Despite his youth, he seemed to me an experienced man of the world. He was\nfrom the Transkei, but spoke English with a rapid urban fluency. To judge from his well-populated waiting room and his desk piled high with papers,\nhe was a busy and successful man. But he did not rush us and seemed genuinely interested in our errand. His name was Walter Sisulu.\nSisulu ran a real estate office that specialized in properties for Africans. In the s, there were still quite a few areas where freehold properties\ncould be purchased by Africans, small holdings located in such places as Alexandra and Sophiatown. In some of these areas, Africans had owned\ntheir own homes for several generations. The rest of the African areas were municipal townships containing matchbox houses for which the\nresidents paid rent to the Johannesburg City Council.\nSisulu\u2019s name was becoming prominent as both a businessman and a local leader. He was already a force in the community. He paid close\nattention as I explained about my difficulties at Fort Hare, my ambition to be a lawyer, and how I intended to register at the University of South Africa\nto finish my degree by correspondence course. I neglected to tell him the circumstances of my arrival in Johannesburg. When I had finished, he\nleaned back in his chair and pondered what I had said. Then, he looked me over one more time, and said that there was a white lawyer with whom\nhe worked named Lazar Sidelsky, who he believed to be a decent and progressive fellow. Sidelsky, he said, was interested in African education.\nHe would talk to Sidelsky about taking me on as an articled clerk.\nIn those days, I believed that proficiency in English and success in business were the direct result of high academic achievements and I assumed\nas a matter of course that Sisulu was a university graduate. I was greatly surprised to learn from my cousin after I left the office that Walter Sisulu\nhad never gone past Standard VI. It was another lesson from Fort Hare that I had to unlearn in Johannesburg. I had been taught that to have a B.A.\nmeant to be a leader, and to be a leader one needed a B.A. But in Johannesburg I found that many of the most outstanding leaders had never been\nto university at all. Even though I had done all the courses in English that were required for a B.A., my English was neither as fluent nor as eloquent\nas many of the men I met in Johannesburg who had not even received a school degree.\n\nAfter a brief time staying with my cousin, I arranged to move in with Reverend J. Mabutho of the Anglican Church at his home on Eighth Avenue in\nAlexandra Township. Reverend Mabutho was a fellow Thembu, a friend of my family\u2019s, and a generous, God-fearing man. His wife, whom we called\nGogo, was warm, affectionate, and a splendid cook who was liberal with her helpings. As a Thembu who knew my family, Reverend Mabutho felt\n\n\fresponsible for me. \u201cOur ancestors have taught us to share,\u201d he once told me.\nBut I had not learned from my experience at Crown Mines, for I did not tell Reverend Mabutho about the circumstances of my leaving the\nTranskei. My omission had unhappy consequences. A few days after I had moved in with the Mabuthos, I was having tea with them when a visitor\narrived. Unfortunately, their friend was Mr. Festile, the induna at the Chamber of Mines who had been present when Justice and I met with Mr.\nWellbeloved. Mr. Festile and I greeted each other in a way that suggested we knew one another, and though nothing was said of our previous\nmeeting, the next day Reverend Mabutho took me aside and made it clear that I could no longer remain under their roof.\nI cursed myself for not having told the whole truth. I had become so used to my deceptions that I lied even when I did not have to. I am sure that\nReverend Mabutho would not have minded, but when he learned of my circumstances from Festile, he felt deceived. In my brief stay in\nJohannesburg, I had left a trail of mistruths, and in each case, the falsehood had come back to haunt me. At the time, I felt that I had no alternative. I\nwas frightened and inexperienced, and I knew that I had not gotten off on the right foot in my new life. In this instance, Reverend Mabutho took pity\non me and found me accommodation with his next-door neighbors, the Xhoma family.\nMr. Xhoma was one of an elite handful of African landowners in Alexandra. His house \u2014 , Seventh Avenue \u2014 was small, particularly as he had\nsix children, but it was pleasant, with a veranda and a tiny garden. In order to make ends meet, Mr. Xhoma, like so many other residents of\nAlexandra, rented rooms to boarders. He had built a tin-roofed room at the back of his property, no more than a shack, with a dirt floor, no heat, no\nelectricity, no running water. But it was a place of my own and I was happy to have it.\nIn the meantime, on Walter\u2019s recommendation, Lazar Sidelsky had agreed to take me on as a clerk while I completed my B.A. degree. The firm\nof Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman was one of the largest law firms in the city and handled business from blacks as well as whites. In addition to\nstudying law and passing certain exams, in order to qualify as an attorney in South Africa one had to undergo several years of apprenticeship to a\npracticing lawyer, which is known as serving articles. But in order for me to become articled, I first had to complete my B.A. degree. To that end, I\nwas studying at night with UNISA, short for the University of South Africa, a respected educational institution that offered credits and degrees by\ncorrespondence.\nIn addition to trying conventional law cases, Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman oversaw real estate transactions for African customers. Walter\nbrought the firm clients who needed a mortgage. The firm would handle their loan applications, and then take a commission, which it would split\nwith the real estate agent. In fact, the law firm would take the lion\u2019s share of the money, leaving only a pittance for the African real estate agent.\nBlacks were given the crumbs from the table, and had no option but to accept them.\nEven so, the law firm was far more liberal than most. It was a Jewish firm, and in my experience, I have found Jews to be more broad-minded\nthan most whites on issues of race and politics, perhaps because they themselves have historically been victims of prejudice. The fact that Lazar\nSidelsky, one of the firm\u2019s partners, would take on a young African as an articled clerk \u2014 something almost unheard of in those days \u2014 was\nevidence of that liberalism.\nMr. Sidelsky, whom I came to respect greatly and who treated me with enormous kindness, was a graduate of the University of the Witwatersrand\nand was in his mid-thirties when I joined the firm. He was involved in African education, donating money and time to African schools. A slender,\ncourtly man, with a pencil mustache, he took a genuine interest in my welfare and future, preaching the value and importance of education \u2014 for me\nindividually and for Africans in general. Only mass education, he used to say, would free my people, arguing that an educated man could not be\noppressed because he could think for himself. He told me over and over again that becoming a successful attorney and thereby a model of\nachievement for my people was the most worthwhile path I could follow.\nI met most of the firm\u2019s staff on my first day in the office, including the one other African employee, Gaur Radebe, with whom I shared an office.\nTen years my senior, Gaur was a clerk, interpreter, and messenger. He was a short, stocky, muscular man, fluent in English, Sotho, and Zulu,\nexpressing himself in all of them with precision, humor, and confidence. He had strong opinions and even stronger arguments to back them up and\nwas a well-known figure in black Johannesburg.\nThat first morning at the firm, a pleasant young white secretary, Miss Lieberman, took me aside and said, \u201cNelson, we have no color bar here at\nthe law firm.\u201d She explained that at midmorning, the tea-man arrived in the front parlor with tea on a tray and a number of cups. \u201cIn honor of your\narrival, we have purchased two new cups for you and Gaur,\u201d she said. \u201cThe secretaries take cups of tea to the principals, but you and Gaur will take\nyour own tea, just as we do. I will call you when the tea comes, and then you can take your tea in the new cups.\u201d She added that I should convey this\nmessage to Gaur. I was grateful for her ministrations, but I knew that the \u201ctwo new cups\u201d she was so careful to mention were evidence of the color\nbar that she said did not exist. The secretaries might share tea with two Africans, but not the cups with which to drink it.\nWhen I told Gaur what Miss Lieberman had said, I noticed his expression change as he listened, just as you can see a mischievous idea enter\nthe head of a child. \u201cNelson,\u201d he said, \u201cat teatime, don\u2019t worry about anything. Just do as I do.\u201d At eleven o\u2019clock, Miss Lieberman informed us that\ntea had arrived. In front of the secretaries and some of the other members of the firm, Gaur went over to the tea tray and ostentatiously ignored the\ntwo new cups, selecting instead one of the old ones, and proceeded to put in generous portions of sugar, milk, and then tea. He stirred his cup\nslowly, and then stood there drinking it in a very self-satisfied way. The secretaries stared at Gaur and then Gaur nodded to me, as if to say, \u201cIt is\nyour turn, Nelson.\u201d\nFor a moment, I was in a quandary. I neither wanted to offend the secretaries nor alienate my new colleague, so I settled on what seemed to me\nthe most prudent course of action: I declined to have any tea at all. I said I was not thirsty. I was then just twenty-three years old and just finding my\nfeet as a man, as a resident of Johannesburg, and as an employee of a white firm, and I saw the middle path as the best and most reasonable one.\nThereafter, at teatime, I would go to the small kitchen in the office and take my tea there in solitude.\nThe secretaries were not always so thoughtful. Some time later, when I was more experienced at the firm, I was dictating some information to a\nwhite secretary when a white client whom she knew came into the office. She was embarrassed, and to demonstrate that she was not taking\ndictation from an African, she took a sixpence from her purse and said stiffly, \u201cNelson, please go out and get me some hair shampoo from the\nchemist.\u201d I left the room and got her shampoo.\nIn the beginning, my work at the firm was quite rudimentary. I was a combination of a clerk and messenger. I would find, arrange, and file\ndocuments and serve or deliver papers around Johannesburg. Later, I would draw up contracts for some of the firm\u2019s African clients. Yet, no matter\nhow small the chore, Mr. Sidelsky would explain to me what it was for and why I was doing it. He was a patient and generous teacher, and sought to\nimpart not only the details of the law but the philosophy behind it. His view of the law was broad rather than narrow, for he believed that it was a tool\nthat could be used to change society.\nWhile Mr. Sidelsky imparted his views of the law, he warned me against politics. Politics, he said, brings out the worst in men. It was the source\nof trouble and corruption, and should be avoided at all costs. He painted a frightening picture of what would happen to me if I drifted into politics,\nand counseled me to avoid the company of men he regarded as troublemakers and rabble-rousers, specifically, Gaur Radebe and Walter Sisulu.\nWhile Mr. Sidelsky respected their abilities, he abhorred their politics.\nGaur was indeed a \u201ctroublemaker,\u201d in the best sense of that term, and was an influential man in the African community in ways that Mr. Sidelsky\n\n\fdid not know or suspect. He was a member of the Advisory Board in the Western Native Township, an elected body of four local people who dealt\nwith the authorities on matters relating to the townships. While it had little power, the board had great prestige among the people. Gaur was also, as\nI soon discovered, a prominent member of both the ANC and the Communist Party.\nGaur was his own man. He did not treat our employers with exaggerated courtesy, and often chided them for their treatment of Africans. \u201cYou\npeople stole our land from us,\u201d he would say, \u201cand enslaved us. Now you are making us pay through the nose to get the worst pieces of it back.\u201d\nOne day, after I returned from doing an errand and entered Mr. Sidelsky\u2019s office, Gaur turned to him and said, \u201cLook, you sit there like a lord whilst\nmy chief runs around doing errands for you. The situation should be reversed, and one day it will, and we will dump all of you into the sea.\u201d Gaur then\nleft the room, and Mr. Sidelsky just shook his head ruefully.\nGaur was an example of a man without a B.A. who seemed infinitely better educated than the fellows who left Fort Hare with glittering degrees.\nNot only was he more knowledgeable, he was bolder and more confident. Although I intended to finish my degree and enter law school, I learned\nfrom Gaur that a degree was not in itself a guarantee of leadership and that it meant nothing unless one went out into the community to prove\noneself.\n\nI was not the only articled clerk at Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman. A fellow about my age named Nat Bregman started work shortly before I had. Nat\nwas bright, pleasant, and thoughtful. He seemed entirely color-blind and became my first white friend. He was a deft mimic and could do fine\nimitations of the voices of Jan Smuts, Franklin Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill. I often sought his counsel on matters of law and office procedure,\nand he was unfailingly helpful.\nOne day, at lunchtime, we were sitting in the office and Nat took out a packet of sandwiches. He removed one sandwich and said, \u201cNelson, take\nhold of the other side of the sandwich.\u201d I was not sure why he asked me to do this, but as I was hungry, I decided to oblige. \u201cNow, pull,\u201d he said. I did\nso, and the sandwich split roughly in two. \u201cNow, eat,\u201d he said. As I was chewing, Nat said, \u201cNelson, what we have just done symbolizes the\nphilosophy of the Communist Party: to share everything we have.\u201d He told me he was a member of the party and explained the rudiments of what\nthe party stood for. I knew that Gaur was a member of the party, but he had never proselytized for it. I listened to Nat that day, and on many\nsubsequent occasions when he preached the virtues of communism and tried to persuade me to join the party. I heard him out, asked questions,\nbut did not join. I was not inclined to join any political organization, and the advice of Mr. Sidelsky was still ringing in my ears. I was also quite\nreligious, and the party\u2019s antipathy to religion put me off. But I appreciated half that sandwich.\nI enjoyed Nat\u2019s company and we often went places together, including a number of lectures and CP meetings. I went primarily out of intellectual\ncuriosity. I was just becoming aware of the history of racial oppression in my own country, and saw the struggle in South Africa as purely racial. But\nthe party saw South Africa\u2019s problems through the lens of the class struggle. To them, it was a matter of the Haves oppressing the Have-nots. This\nwas intriguing to me, but did not seem particularly relevant to present-day South Africa. It may have been applicable to Germany or England or\nRussia, but it did not seem appropriate for the country that I knew. Even so, I listened and learned.\nNat invited me to a number of parties where there was a mixture of whites, Africans, Indians, and Coloureds. The get-togethers were arranged by\nthe party, and most of the guests were party members. I remember being anxious the first time I went, mainly because I did not think I had the\nproper attire. At Fort Hare, we were taught to wear a tie and jacket to a social function of any kind. Though my wardrobe was severely limited, I\nmanaged to find a tie to wear to the party.\nI discovered a lively and gregarious group of people who did not seem to pay attention to color at all. It was one of the first mixed gatherings I had\never attended, and I was far more of an observer than a participant. I felt extremely shy, wary of committing a faux pas, and unequipped to\nparticipate in the high-flown and rapid-fire conversations. My thoughts seemed undeveloped by comparison to the sophisticated dialogue around\nme.\nAt one point in the evening, I was introduced to Michael Harmel, who I was told had a master\u2019s degree in English from Rhodes University. I was\nimpressed with his degree, but when I met him, I thought to myself, \u201cThis chap has an M.A. and he is not even wearing a tie!\u201d I just could not\nreconcile this discrepancy. Later, Michael and I became friends, and I came to admire him greatly, in no small measure because he rejected so\nmany of the rather foolish conventions I once embraced. He was not only a brilliant writer, but was so committed to communism that he lived in a\nmanner no different from an African. IN , a number of critical events occurred that shaped my political development and the direction of the struggle. The mineworkers\u2019 strike of\n, in which , African miners along the Reef went on strike, affected me greatly. At the initiative of J. B. Marks, Dan Tloome, Gaur Radebe,\nand a number of ANC labor activists, the African Mine Workers Union (AMWU) had been created in the early s. There were as many as\n, African miners working on the Reef, most of them making no more than two shillings a day. The union leadership had repeatedly pressed\nthe Chamber of Mines for a minimum wage of ten shillings a day, as well as family housing and two weeks\u2019 paid leave. The chamber ignored the\nunion\u2019s demands.\nIn one of the largest such actions in South African history, the miners went on strike for a week and maintained their solidarity. The state\u2019s\nretaliation was ruthless. The leaders were arrested, the compounds surrounded by police, and the AMWU offices ransacked. A march was brutally\nrepulsed by police; twelve miners died. The Natives Representative Council adjourned in protest. I had a number of relations who were\nmineworkers, and during the week of the strike I visited them, discussed the issues, and expressed my support.\nJ. B. Marks, a longtime member of the ANC and the Communist Party, was then president of the African Mine Workers Union. Born in the\nTransvaal, of mixed parentage, Marks was a charismatic figure with a distinctive sense of humor. He was a tall man with a light complexion. During\nthe strike I sometimes went with him from mine to mine, talking to workers and planning strategy. From morning to night, he displayed cool and\nreasoned leadership, with his humor leavening even the most difficult crisis. I was impressed by the organization of the union and its ability to\ncontrol its membership, even in the face of such savage opposition.\nIn the end, the state prevailed: the strike was suppressed and the union crushed. The strike was the beginning of my close relationship with\nMarks. I visited him often at his house, and we discussed my opposition to communism at great length. Marks was a stalwart member of the party,\nbut he never personalized my objections, and felt that it was natural for a young man to embrace nationalism, but that as I grew older and more\nexperienced, my views would broaden. I had these same discussions with Moses Kotane and Yusuf Dadoo, both of whom believed, like Marks,\nthat communism had to be adapted to the African situation. Other Communist members of the ANC condemned me and the other Youth Leaguers,\nbut Marks, Kotane, and Dadoo never did.\nAfter the strike, fifty-two men, including Kotane, Marks, and many other Communists, were arrested and prosecuted, first for incitement then for\nsedition. It was a political trial, an effort by the state to show that it was not soft on the Red Menace.\nThat same year, another event forced me to recast my whole approach to political work. In , the Smuts government passed the Asiatic Land\nTenure Act, which curtailed the free movement of Indians, circumscribed the areas where Indians could reside and trade, and severely restricted\ntheir right to buy property. In return, they were provided with representation in Parliament by token white surrogates. Dr. Dadoo, president of the\nTransvaal Indian Congress, castigated the restrictions and dismissed the offer of parliamentary representation as \u201ca spurious offer of a sham\nfranchise.\u201d This law \u2014 known as the Ghetto Act \u2014 was a grave insult to the Indian community and anticipated the Group Areas Act, which would\neventually circumscribe the freedom of all South Africans of color.\nThe Indian community was outraged and launched a concerted, two-year campaign of passive resistance to oppose the measures. Led by Drs.\nDadoo and G. M. Naicker, president of the Natal Indian Congress, the Indian community conducted a mass campaign that impressed us with its\norganization and dedication. Housewives, priests, doctors, lawyers, traders, students, and workers took their place in the front lines of the protest.\nFor two years, people suspended their lives to take up the battle. Mass rallies were held; land reserved for whites was occupied and picketed. No\nless than two thousand volunteers went to jail, and Drs. Dadoo and Naicker were sentenced to six months\u2019 hard labor.\nThe campaign was confined to the Indian community and the participation of other groups was not encouraged. Even so, Dr. Xuma and other\nAfrican leaders spoke at several meetings and along with the Youth League gave full moral support to the struggle of the Indian people. The\ngovernment crippled the rebellion with harsh laws and intimidation, but we in the Youth League and the ANC had witnessed the Indian people\nregister an extraordinary protest against color oppression in a way that Africans and the ANC had not. Ismail Meer and J. N. Singh suspended their\nstudies, said good-bye to their families, and went to prison. Ahmed Kathrada, who was still a high-school student, did the same thing. I often visited\nthe home of Amina Pahad for lunch, and then suddenly, this charming woman put aside her apron and went to jail for her beliefs. If I had once\nquestioned the willingness of the Indian community to protest against oppression, I no longer could.\nThe Indian campaign became a model for the type of protest that we in the Youth League were calling for. It instilled a spirit of defiance and\nradicalism among the people, broke the fear of prison, and boosted the popularity and influence of the NIC and TIC. They reminded us that the\nfreedom struggle was not merely a question of making speeches, holding meetings, passing resolutions, and sending deputations, but of\nmeticulous organization, militant mass action, and, above all, the willingness to suffer and sacrifice. The Indian campaign hearkened back to the\n passive resistance campaign in which Mahatma Gandhi led a tumultuous procession of Indians crossing illegally from Natal to the Transvaal.\nThat was history; this campaign was taking place before my own eyes.\n\nEarly in , Evelyn and I moved to a two-room municipal house of our own in Orlando East and thereafter to a slightly larger house at No. \nOrlando West. Orlando West was a dusty, spartan area of boxy municipal houses that would later become part of Greater Soweto, Soweto being\nan acronym for South-Western Townships. Our house was situated in an area nicknamed Westcliff by its residents after the fancy white suburb to\nthe north.\nThe rent of our new home was seventeen shillings and sixpence per month. The house itself was identical to hundreds of others built on postagestamp-size plots on dirt roads. It had the same standard tin roof, the same cement floor, a narrow kitchen, and a bucket toilet in back. Although\nthere were streetlamps outside, we used kerosene lamps inside as the homes were not yet electrified. The bedroom was so small that a double\nbed took up almost the entire floor space. These houses were built by the municipal authorities for workers who needed to be near town. To relieve\nthe monotony, some people planted small gardens or painted their doors bright colors. It was the very opposite of grand, but it was my first true\nhome of my own and I was mightily proud. A man is not a man until he has a house of his own. I did not know then that it would be the only residence\nthat would be entirely mine for many, many years.\nThe state had allocated the house to Evelyn and me because we were no longer just two, but three. That year, our first son, Madiba Thembekile,\nwas born. He was given my clan name of Madiba, but was known by the nickname Thembi. He was a solid, happy little boy who most people said\nresembled his mother more than his father. I had now produced an heir, though I had little as yet to bequeath to him. But I had perpetuated the\nMandela name and the Madiba clan, which is one of the basic responsibilities of a Xhosa male.\nI finally had a stable base, and I went from being a guest in other people\u2019s homes to having guests in my own. My sister Leabie joined us and I\ntook her across the railroad line to enroll her at Orlando High School. In my culture, all the members of one\u2019s family have a claim to the hospitality of\n\n\fany other member of the family; the combination of my large extended family and my new house meant a great number of guests.\nI enjoyed domesticity, even though I had little time for it. I delighted in playing with Thembi, bathing him and feeding him, and putting him to bed\nwith a little story. In fact, I love playing with children and chatting with them; it has always been one of the things that make me feel most at peace. I\nenjoyed relaxing at home, reading quietly, taking in the sweet and savory smells emanating from pots boiling in the kitchen. But I was rarely at home\nto enjoy these things.\nDuring the latter part of that year, the Reverend Michael Scott came to stay with us. Scott was an Anglican clergyman and a great fighter for\nAfrican rights. He had been approached by a man named Komo, who was representing a squatter camp outside of Johannesburg that the\ngovernment was seeking to relocate. Komo wanted Scott to make a protest against the removal. Scott said, \u201cIf I am going to help you I must be one\nof you,\u201d and he proceeded to move to the squatter camp and start a congregation there. Scott\u2019s shantytown for the homeless was built near a rocky\nknoll and the residents christened it Tobruk, after the battle in the North Africa campaign of the war. It was a place I sometimes took Thembi on\nSunday morning, as he liked to play hide-and-seek among the rocks. After Scott had set up his congregation, he found that Komo was embezzling\nmoney from people who were contributing to the fight against the removal. When Scott confronted Komo, Komo drove Scott out of camp and\nthreatened his life.\nScott took refuge with us in Orlando and brought along an African priest named Dlamini, who also had a wife and children. Our house was tiny,\nand Scott slept in the sitting room, Dlamini and his wife slept in another room, and we put all the children in the kitchen. Reverend Scott was a\nmodest, unassuming man, but Dlamini was a bit hard to take. At mealtimes, he would complain about the food. \u201cLook, here,\u201d he would say, \u201cthis\nmeat of yours, it\u2019s very lean and hard, not properly cooked at all. I\u2019m not used to meals like this.\u201d Scott was appalled by this, and admonished\nDlamini, but Dlamini took no heed. The next night he might say, \u201cWell, this is a bit better than yesterday, but far from well prepared. Mandela, you\nknow your wife just cannot cook.\u201d\nDlamini indirectly caused the situation to be resolved because I was so eager to have him out of the house that I went to the squatter camp myself\nand explained that Scott was a true friend of theirs, unlike Komo, and that they had to choose between the two. They then organized an election in\nwhich Scott triumphed, and he moved back to the squatter camp, taking Father Dlamini with him.\n\nEarly in , I completed the requisite period of three years for articles and my time at Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman came to an end. I resolved\nto become a full-time student in order to earn my LL.B. so that I could go out on my own and practice as an attorney. The loss of the eight pounds,\nten shillings, and one penny per month that I earned at Sidelsky was devastating. I applied to the Bantu Welfare Trust at the South African Institute of\nRace Relations in Johannesburg for a loan of \u00a3 sterling to help finance my law studies, which included university fees, textbooks, and a monthly\nallowance. I was given a loan of \u00a3.\nThree months later, I wrote to them again, noting that my wife was about to take maternity leave, and we would lose her salary of seventeen\npounds per month, which was absolutely necessary to our survival. I did receive the additional money, for which I was grateful, but the\ncircumstances which warranted it were unfortunate. Our daughter Makaziwe\u2019s birth was not difficult, yet she was frail and sickly. From the start, we\nfeared the worst. Many nights, Evelyn and I took turns looking after her. We did not know the name of whatever was consuming this tiny girl and the\ndoctors could not explain the nature of the problem. Evelyn monitored the baby with the combination of a mother\u2019s tirelessness and a nurse\u2019s\nprofessional efficiency. When she was nine months old, Makaziwe passed away. Evelyn was distraught, and the only thing that helped temper my\nown grief was trying to alleviate hers.\n\nIn politics, no matter how much one plans, circumstances often dictate events. In July of , during an informal discussion with Lembede about\nYouth League business, he complained to me of a sudden pain in his stomach and an accompanying chill. When the pain worsened, we drove him\nto Coronation Hospital, and that same night, he was dead at the age of thirty-three. Many were deeply affected by his death. Walter Sisulu seemed\nalmost prostrate with grief. His passing was a setback to the movement, for Lembede was a fount of ideas and attracted others to the organization.\nLembede was succeeded by Peter Mda, whose analytical approach, ability to express himself clearly and simply, and tactical experience made\nhim an excellent politician and an outstanding leader of the Youth League. Mda was a lean fellow; he had no excess weight, just as he used no\nexcess words. In his broad-minded tolerance of different views, his own thinking was more mature than that of Lembede. It took Mda\u2019s leadership\nto advance Lembede\u2019s cause.\nMda believed the Youth League should function as an internal pressure group, a militant nationalistic wing within the ANC as a whole that would\npropel the organization into a new era. At the time, the ANC did not have a single full-time employee, and was generally poorly organized, operating\nin a haphazard way. (Later, Walter became the first and only full-time ANC staff member at an extremely meager salary.)\nMda quickly established a branch of the Youth League at Fort Hare under the guidance of Z. K. Matthews and Godfrey Pitje, a lecturer in\nanthropology. They recruited outstanding students, bringing in fresh blood and new ideas. Among the most outstanding were Professor Matthews\u2019s\nbrilliant son Joe, and Robert Sobukwe, a dazzling orator and incisive thinker.\nMda was more moderate in his nationalism than Lembede, and his thinking was without the racial tinge that characterized Lembede\u2019s. He hated\nwhite oppression and white domination, not white people themselves. He was also less extreme in his opposition to the Communist Party than\nLembede \u2014 or myself. I was among the Youth Leaguers who were suspicious of the white left. Even though I had befriended many white\nCommunists, I was wary of white influence in the ANC, and I opposed joint campaigns with the party. I was concerned that the Communists were\nintent on taking over our movement in the guise of joint action. I believed that it was an undiluted African nationalism, not Marxism or multiracialism,\nthat would liberate us. With a few of my colleagues in the league, I even went so far as breaking up CP meetings by storming the stage, tearing up\nsigns, and capturing the microphone. At the national conference of the ANC in December, the Youth League introduced a motion demanding the\nexpulsion of all members of the Communist Party, but we were soundly defeated. Despite the influence the Indian passive resistance campaign of\n had on me, I felt about the Indians the same way I did about the Communists: that they would tend to dominate the ANC, in part because of\ntheir superior education, experience, and training.\n\nIn , I was elected to the Executive Committee of the Transvaal ANC and served under C. S. Ramohanoe, president of the Transvaal region.\nThis was my first position in the ANC proper, and represented a milestone in my commitment to the organization. Until that time, the sacrifices I had\nmade had not gone much further than being absent from my wife and family during weekends and returning home late in the evening. I had not been\ndirectly involved in any major campaign, and I did not yet understand the hazards and unending difficulties of the life of a freedom fighter. I had\n\n\fcoasted along without having to pay a price for my commitment. From the time I was elected to the Executive Committee of the Transvaal region, I\ncame to identify myself with the congress as a whole, with its hopes and despairs, its successes and failures; I was now bound heart and soul.\nRamohanoe was another one of those from whom I learned. He was a staunch nationalist and a skillful organizer who was able to balance\ndivergent views and come forward with a suitable compromise. While Ramohanoe was unsympathetic to the Communists, he worked well with\nthem. He believed that the ANC was a national organization that should welcome all those who supported our cause.\n\nIn , in the wake of the Indian passive resistance campaign, Drs. Xuma, Dadoo, and Naicker, presidents, respectively, of the ANC, the\nTransvaal Indian Congress, and the Natal Indian Congress, signed the Doctors\u2019 Pact agreeing to join forces against a common enemy. This was a\nsignificant step toward the unity of the African and Indian movements. Rather than create a central political body to direct all the various movements,\nthey agreed to cooperate on matters of common interest. Later, they were joined by the APO, the African People\u2019s Organization, a Coloured\norganization.\nBut such an agreement was at best tentative, for each national group faced problems peculiar to itself. The pass system, for example, barely\naffected Indians or Coloureds. The Ghetto Act, which had prompted the Indian protests, barely affected Africans. Coloured groups at the time were\nmore concerned about the race classification and job reservation, issues that did not affect Africans and Indians to the same degree.\nThe Doctors\u2019 Pact laid a foundation for the future cooperation of Africans, Indians, and Coloureds, since it respected the independence of each\nindividual group, but acknowledged the achievements that could be realized from acting in concert. The Doctors\u2019 Pact precipitated a series of\nnonracial, antigovernment campaigns around the country, which sought to bring together Africans and Indians in the freedom struggle. The first of\nthese campaigns was the First Transvaal and Orange Free State Peoples Assembly for Votes for All, a campaign for the extension of the franchise\nto all black South Africans. Dr. Xuma announced ANC participation at a press conference over which I presided. At the time, we believed the\ncampaign would be run by the ANC, but when we learned that the ANC would not be leading the campaign, the Transvaal Executive Committee\ndecided that the ANC should withdraw. My idea at the time was that the ANC should be involved only in campaigns that the ANC itself led. I was\nmore concerned with who got the credit than whether the campaign would be successful.\nEven after the withdrawal, Ramohanoe, the president of the Transvaal region of the ANC, issued a press statement calling on Africans in the\nprovince to take part in the campaign of Votes for All in clear contravention of the decision of the Transvaal Executive Committee. This was an act\nof disobedience the committee could not tolerate. At a conference called to resolve this dispute, I was asked to move a no-confidence motion\nagainst Ramohanoe for his disobedience. I felt an acute conflict between duty and personal loyalty, between my obligations to my organization and\nto my friend. I well knew that I would be condemning the action of a man whose integrity and devotion to the struggle I never questioned, a man\nwhose sacrifice in the liberation struggle was far greater than my own. I knew that the action that he had called for was in fact a noble one; he\nbelieved that Africans should help their Indian brothers.\nBut the seriousness of Ramohanoe\u2019s disobedience was too strong. While an organization like the ANC is made up of individuals, it is greater\nthan any of its individual parts, and loyalty to the organization takes precedence over loyalty to an individual. I agreed to lead the attack and offered\nthe motion condemning him, which was seconded by Oliver Tambo. This caused an uproar in the house, with verbal battles between those in the\nregion who supported their president and those who were on the side of the executive. The meeting broke up in disorder. AFRICANS could not vote, but that did not mean that we did not care who won elections. The white general election of  matched the ruling\nUnited Party, led by General Smuts, then at the height of his international regard, against the revived National Party. While Smuts had enlisted\nSouth Africa on the side of the Allies in World War II, the National Party refused to support Great Britain and publicly sympathized with Nazi\nGermany. The National Party\u2019s campaign centered around the swart gevaar (the black danger), and they fought the election on the twin slogans of\nDie kaffer op sy plek (The nigger in his place) and Die koelies uit die land (The coolies out of the country) \u2014 coolies being the Afrikaner\u2019s\nderogatory term for Indians.\nThe Nationalists, led by Dr. Daniel Malan, a former minister of the Dutch Reform Church and a newspaper editor, were a party animated by\nbitterness \u2014 bitterness toward the English, who had treated them as inferiors for decades, and bitterness toward the African, who the Nationalists\nbelieved was threatening the prosperity and purity of Afrikaner culture. Africans had no loyalty to General Smuts, but we had even less for the\nNational Party.\nMalan\u2019s platform was known as apartheid. Apartheid was a new term but an old idea. It literally means \u201capartness\u201d and it represented the\ncodification in one oppressive system of all the laws and regulations that had kept Africans in an inferior position to whites for centuries. What had\nbeen more or less de facto was to become relentlessly de jure. The often haphazard segregation of the past three hundred years was to be\nconsolidated into a monolithic system that was diabolical in its detail, inescapable in its reach, and overwhelming in its power. The premise of\napartheid was that whites were superior to Africans, Coloureds, and Indians, and the function of it was to entrench white supremacy forever. As the\nNationalists put it, \u201cDie wit man moet altyd baas wees\u201d (The white man must always remain boss). Their platform rested on the term baasskap,\nliterally boss-ship, a freighted word that stood for white supremacy in all its harshness. The policy was supported by the Dutch Reform Church,\nwhich furnished apartheid with its religious underpinnings by suggesting that Afrikaners were God\u2019s chosen people and that blacks were a\nsubservient species. In the Afrikaner\u2019s worldview, apartheid and the church went hand in hand.\nThe Nationalists\u2019 victory was the beginning of the end of the domination of the Afrikaner by the Englishman. English would now take second place\nto Afrikaans as an official language. The Nationalist slogan encapsulated their mission: \u201cEie volk, eie taal, eie land\u201d \u2014 Our own people, our own\nlanguage, our own land. In the distorted cosmology of the Afrikaner, the Nationalist victory was like the Israelites\u2019 journey to the Promised Land. This\nwas the fulfillment of God\u2019s promise, and the justification for their view that South Africa should be a white man\u2019s country forever.\nThe victory was a shock. The United Party and General Smuts had beaten the Nazis, and surely they would defeat the National Party. On election\nday, I attended a meeting in Johannesburg with Oliver Tambo and several others. We barely discussed the question of a Nationalist government\nbecause we did not expect one. The meeting went on all night and we emerged at dawn and found a newspaper vendor selling the Rand Daily\nMail: the Nationalists had triumphed. I was stunned and dismayed, but Oliver took a more considered line. \u201cI like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI like this.\u201d I could\nnot imagine why. He explained, \u201cNow we will know exactly who our enemies are and where we stand.\u201d\nEven General Smuts realized the dangers of this harsh ideology, decrying apartheid as \u201ca crazy concept, born of prejudice and fear.\u201d From the\nmoment of the Nationalists\u2019 election, we knew that our land would henceforth be a place of tension and strife. For the first time in South African\nhistory, an exclusively Afrikaner party led the government. \u201cSouth Africa belongs to us once more,\u201d Malan proclaimed in his victory speech.\n\nThat same year, the Youth League outlined its policy in a document written by Mda and issued by the league\u2019s executive committee. It was a rallying\ncry to all patriotic youth to overthrow white domination. We rejected the Communist notion that Africans were oppressed primarily as an economic\nclass rather than as a race, adding that we needed to create a powerful national liberation movement under the banner of African nationalism and\n\u201cled by Africans themselves.\u201d\nWe advocated the redivision of land on an equitable basis; the abolition of color bars prohibiting Africans from doing skilled work; and the need\nfor free and compulsory education. The document also articulated the push-and-pull between two rival theories of African nationalism, between the\nmore extreme, Marcus Garvey\u2013inspired, \u201cAfrica for the Africans\u201d nationalism and the Africanism of the Youth League, which recognized that South\nAfrica was a multiracial country.\nI was sympathetic to the ultra-revolutionary stream of African nationalism. I was angry at the white man, not at racism. While I was not prepared to\nhurl the white man into the sea, I would have been perfectly happy if he climbed aboard his steamships and left the continent of his own volition.\nThe Youth League was marginally more friendly to the Indians and the Coloureds, stating that Indians, like Africans, were oppressed, but that\nIndians had India, a mother country that they could look to. The Coloureds, too, were oppressed, but unlike the Indians had no mother country except\nAfrica. I was prepared to accept Indians and Coloureds provided they accepted our policies; but their interests were not identical with ours, and I\nwas skeptical of whether or not they could truly embrace our cause.\n\nIn short order, Malan began to implement his pernicious program. Within weeks of coming to power, the Nationalist government pardoned Robey\nLeibbrandt, the wartime traitor who had organized uprisings in support of Nazi Germany. The government announced their intention to curb the\ntrade union movement and do away with the limited franchises of the Indian, Coloured, and African peoples. The Separate Representation of\nVoters Act eventually robbed the Coloureds of their representation in Parliament. The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was introduced in \nand was followed in rapid succession by the Immorality Act, making sexual relations between white and nonwhite illegal. The Population\nRegistration Act labeled all South Africans by race, making color the single most important arbiter of individuals. Malan introduced the Group Areas\nAct \u2014 which he described as \u201cthe very essence of apartheid\u201d \u2014 requiring separate urban areas for each racial group. In the past, whites took land\nby force; now they secured it by legislation.\nIn response to this new and much more powerful threat from the state, the ANC embarked on an unaccustomed and historic path. In , the\nANC launched a landmark effort to turn itself into a truly mass organization. The Youth League drafted a Program of Action, the cornerstone of\nwhich was a campaign of mass mobilization.\nAt the ANC annual conference in Bloemfontein, the organization adopted the league\u2019s Program of Action, which called for boycotts, strikes, stayat-homes, passive resistance, protest demonstrations, and other forms of mass action. This was a radical change: the ANC\u2019s policy had always\nbeen to keep its activities within the law. We in the Youth League had seen the failure of legal and constitutional means to strike at racial\noppression; now the entire organization was set to enter a more activist stage.\nThese changes did not come without internal upheaval. A few weeks before the conference, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo, and I met privately with\n\n\fDr. Xuma at his home in Sophiatown. We explained that we thought the time had come for mass action along the lines of Gandhi\u2019s nonviolent\nprotests in India and the  passive resistance campaign, asserting that the ANC had become too docile in the face of oppression. The ANC\u2019s\nleaders, we said, had to be willing to violate the law and if necessary go to prison for their beliefs as Gandhi had.\nDr. Xuma was adamantly opposed, claiming that such strategies were premature and would merely give the government an excuse to crush the\nANC. Such forms of protest, he said, would eventually take place in South Africa, but at the moment such a step would be fatal. He made it clear\nthat he was a doctor with a wide and prosperous practice that he would not jeopardize by going to prison.\nWe gave Dr. Xuma an ultimatum: we would support him for reelection to the presidency of the ANC provided he supported our proposed\nProgram of Action. If he would not support our program, we would not support him. Dr. Xuma became heated, accusing us of blackmail and laying\ndown conditions on which we would vote for him. He told us that we were young and arrogant, and treating him without respect. We remonstrated\nwith him, but to no avail. He would not go along with our proposal.\nHe unceremoniously showed us out of his house at  P.M., and closed the gate behind him. There were no streetlights in Sophiatown and it was\na moonless night. All forms of public transport had long since ceased and we lived miles away in Orlando. Oliver remarked that Xuma could have at\nthe very least offered us some transport. Walter was friendly with a family that lived nearby, and we prevailed upon them to take us in for the night.\n\nAt the conference that December, we in the Youth League knew we had the votes to depose Dr. Xuma. As an alternative candidate, we sponsored\nDr. J. S. Moroka for the presidency. He was not our first choice. Professor Z. K. Matthews was the man we wanted to lead us, but Z.K. considered\nus too radical and our plan of action too impractical. He called us naive firebrands, adding that we would mellow with age.\nDr. Moroka was an unlikely choice. He was a member of the All-African Convention (AAC), which was dominated by Trotskyite elements at that\ntime. When he agreed to stand against Dr. Xuma, the Youth League then enrolled him as a member of the ANC. When we first approached him, he\nconsistently referred to the ANC as the African National \u201cCouncil.\u201d He was not very knowledgeable about the ANC nor was he an experienced\nactivist, but he was respectable, and amenable to our program. Like Dr. Xuma, he was a doctor, and one of the wealthiest black men in South\nAfrica. He had studied at Edinburgh and Vienna. His great-grandfather had been a chief in the Orange Free State, and had greeted the Afrikaner\nvoortrekkers of the nineteenth century with open arms and gifts of land, and then been betrayed. Dr. Xuma was defeated and Dr. Moroka became\npresident-general of the ANC. Walter Sisulu was elected the new secretary-general, and Oliver Tambo was elected to the National Executive\nCommittee.\nThe Program of Action approved at the annual conference called for the pursuit of political rights through the use of boycotts, strikes, civil\ndisobedience, and noncooperation. In addition, it called for a national day of work stoppage in protest against the racist and reactionary policies of\nthe government. This was a departure from the days of decorous protest, and many of the old stalwarts of the ANC were to fade away in this new\nera of greater militancy. Youth League members had now graduated to the senior organization. We had now guided the ANC to a more radical and\nrevolutionary path.\nI could only celebrate the Youth League\u2019s triumph from a distance, for I was unable to attend the conference myself. I was then working for a new\nlaw firm and they did not give me permission to take two days off to attend the conference in Bloemfontein. The firm was a liberal one, but wanted\nme to concentrate on my work and forget politics. I would have lost my job if I had attended the conference and I could not afford to do that.\n\nThe spirit of mass action surged, but I remained skeptical of any action undertaken with the Communists and Indians. The \u201cDefend Free Speech\nConvention\u201d in March , organized by the Transvaal ANC, the Transvaal Indian Congress, the African People\u2019s Organization, and the District\nCommittee of the Communist Party, drew ten thousand people at Johannesburg\u2019s Market Square. Dr. Moroka, without consulting the executive,\nagreed to preside over the convention. The convention was a success, yet I remained wary, as the prime mover behind it was the party.\nAt the instigation of the Communist Party and the Indian Congress, the convention passed a resolution for a one-day general strike, known as\nFreedom Day, on May , calling for the abolition of the pass laws and all discriminatory legislation. Although I supported these objectives, I believed\nthat the Communists were trying to steal the thunder from the ANC\u2019s National Day of Protest. I opposed the May Day strike on the grounds that the\nANC had not originated the campaign, believing that we should concentrate on our own campaign.\nAhmed Kathrada was then barely twenty-one and, like all youth, eager to flex his muscles. He was a key member of the Transvaal Indian Youth\nCongress and had heard I was opposed to the May Day strike. One day, while walking on Commissioner Street, I met Kathrada and he heatedly\nconfronted me, charging that I and the Youth League did not want to work with Indians or Coloureds. In a challenging tone, he said, \u201cYou are an\nAfrican leader and I am an Indian youth. But I am convinced of the support of the African masses for the strike and I challenge you to nominate any\nAfrican township for a meeting and I guarantee the people will support me.\u201d It was a hollow threat, but it angered me all the same. I even complained\nto a joint meeting of the Executive Committee of the ANC, the South African Indian Congress, and the Communist Party, but Ismail Meer calmed\nme down, saying, \u201cNelson, he is young and hotheaded, don\u2019t you be the same.\u201d I consequently felt a bit sheepish about my actions and I withdrew\nthe complaint. Although I disagreed with Kathrada, I admired his fire, and it was an incident we came to laugh about.\nThe Freedom Day strike went ahead without official ANC support. In anticipation, the government banned all meetings and gatherings for May .\nMore than two-thirds of African workers stayed at home during the one-day strike. That night, Walter and I were in Orlando West on the fringes of a\nFreedom Day crowd that had gathered despite the government\u2019s restrictions. The moon was bright, and as we watched the orderly march of\nprotesters, we could see a group of policemen camped across a stream about five hundred yards away. They must have seen us as well, because\nall of a sudden, they started firing in our direction. We dove to the ground, and remained there as mounted police galloped into the crowd,\nsmashing people with batons. We took refuge in a nearby nurses\u2019 dormitory, where we heard bullets smashing into the wall of the building.\nEighteen Africans died and many others were wounded in this indiscriminate and unprovoked attack.\nDespite protest and criticism, the Nationalist response was to tighten the screws of repression. A few weeks later, the government introduced the\nnotorious Suppression of Communism Act and the ANC called an emergency conference in Johannesburg. The act outlawed the Communist Party\nof South Africa and made it a crime, punishable by a maximum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, to be a member of the party or to further the aims of\ncommunism. But the bill was drafted in such a broad way that it outlawed all but the mildest protest against the state, deeming it a crime to\nadvocate any doctrine that promoted \u201cpolitical, industrial, social or economic change within the Union by the promotion of disturbance or disorder.\u201d\nEssentially, the bill permitted the government to outlaw any organization and to restrict any individual opposed to its policies.\nThe ANC, the SAIC, and the APO again met to discuss these new measures, and Dr. Dadoo, among others, said that it would be foolish to allow\npast differences to thwart a united front against the government. I spoke and echoed his sentiments: clearly, the repression of any one liberation\ngroup was repression against all liberation groups. It was at that meeting that Oliver uttered prophetic words: \u201cToday it is the Communist Party.\n\n\fTomorrow it will be our trade unions, our Indian Congress, our APO, our African National Congress.\u201d\nSupported by the SAIC and the APO, the ANC resolved to stage a National Day of Protest on June , , against the government\u2019s murder\nof eighteen Africans on May  and the passage of the Suppression of Communism Act. The proposal was ratified, and in preparation for the Day of\nProtest, we closed ranks with the SAIC, the APO, and the Communist Party. Here, I believed, was a sufficient threat that compelled us to join hands\nwith our Indian and Communist colleagues.\nEarlier that year I had been coopted onto the National Executive Committee of the ANC, taking the place of Dr. Xuma, who had resigned after his\nfailure to be reelected president-general. I was not unmindful of the fact that it had been Dr. Xuma who had tried to help me get my first job when I\ncame to Johannesburg ten years before, when I had no thought of entering politics. Now, as a member of the National Executive Committee, I was\nplaying on the first team with the most senior people in the ANC. I had moved from the role of a gadfly within the organization to one of the powers\nthat I had been rebelling against. It was a heady feeling, and not without mixed emotions. In some ways, it is easier to be a dissident, for then one is\nwithout responsibility. As a member of the executive, I had to weigh arguments and make decisions, and expect to be criticized by rebels like\nmyself.\n\nMass action was perilous in South Africa, where it was a criminal offense for an African to strike, and where the rights of free speech and\nmovement were unmercifully curtailed. By striking, an African worker stood not only to lose his job but his entire livelihood and his right to stay in the\narea in which he was living. In my experience, a political strike is always riskier than an economic one. A strike based on a political grievance\nrather than on clear-cut issues like higher wages or shorter hours is a more precarious form of protest and demands particularly efficient\norganization. The Day of Protest was a political rather than an economic strike.\nIn preparation for June , Walter traveled around the country consulting local leaders. In his absence, I took charge of the bustling ANC office,\nthe hub of a complicated national action. Every day, various leaders looked in to see that matters were going according to plan: Moses Kotane, Dr.\nDadoo, Diliza Mji, J. B. Marks, president of the Transvaal ANC, Yusuf Cachalia and his brother Maulvi, Gaur Radebe, secretary of the Council of\nAction, Michael Harmel, Peter Raboroko, Nthato Motlana. I was coordinating the actions in different parts of the country, and talking by phone with\nregional leaders. We had left ourselves little time, and the planning was hastily done.\nThe Day of Protest was the ANC\u2019s first attempt to hold a political strike on a national scale and it was a moderate success. In the cities, the\nmajority of workers stayed home and black businesses did not open. In Bethal, Gert Sibande, who later became president of the Transvaal ANC,\nled a demonstration of five thousand people, which received headlines in major papers all across the country. The Day of Protest boosted our\nmorale, made us realize our strength, and sent a warning to the Malan government that we would not remain passive in the face of apartheid. June\n has since become a landmark day in the freedom struggle and within the liberation movement it is observed as Freedom Day.\nIt was the first time I had taken a significant part in a national campaign, and I felt the exhilaration that springs from the success of a well-planned\nbattle against the enemy and the sense of comradeship that is born of fighting against formidable odds.\nThe struggle, I was learning, was all-consuming. A man involved in the struggle was a man without a home life. It was in the midst of the Day of\nProtest that my second son, Makgatho Lewanika, was born. I was with Evelyn at the hospital when he came into the world, but it was only a brief\nrespite from my activities. He was named for Sefako Mapogo Makgatho, the second president of the ANC, from  until , and Lewanika, a\nleading chief in Zambia. Makgatho, the son of a Pedi chief, had led volunteers to defy the color bar that did not permit Africans to walk on the\nsidewalks of Pretoria, and his name for me was an emblem of indomitability and courage.\nOne day, during this same time, my wife informed me that my elder son, Thembi, then five, had asked her, \u201cWhere does Daddy live?\u201d I had been\nreturning home late at night, long after he had gone to sleep, and departing early in the morning before he woke. I did not relish being deprived of\nthe company of my children. I missed them a great deal during those days, long before I had any inkling that I would spend decades apart from\nthem.\n\nI was far more certain in those days of what I was against than what I was for. My long-standing opposition to communism was breaking down.\nMoses Kotane, the general-secretary of the party and a member of the executive of the ANC, often came to my house late at night and we would\ndebate until morning. Clear-thinking and self-taught, Kotane was the son of peasant farmers in the Transvaal. \u201cNelson,\u201d he would say, \u201cwhat do you\nhave against us? We are all fighting the same enemy. We do not seek to dominate the ANC; we are working within the context of African\nnationalism.\u201d In the end, I had no good response to his arguments.\nBecause of my friendships with Kotane, Ismail Meer, and Ruth First, and my observation of their own sacrifices, I was finding it more and more\ndifficult to justify my prejudice against the party. Within the ANC, party members J. B. Marks, Edwin Mofutsanyana, Dan Tloome, and David\nBopape, among others, were devoted and hardworking, and left nothing to gainsay as freedom fighters. Dr. Dadoo, one of the leaders of the \nresistance, was a well-known Marxist whose role as a fighter for human rights had made him a hero to all groups. I could not, and no longer did,\nquestion the bona fides of such men and women.\nIf I could not challenge their dedication, I could still question the philosophical and practical underpinnings of Marxism. But I had little knowledge of\nMarxism, and in political discussions with my Communist friends I found myself handicapped by my ignorance of Marxist philosophy. I decided to\nremedy this.\nI acquired the complete works of Marx and Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao Tse-tung, and others and probed into the philosophy of dialectical and\nhistorical materialism. I had little time to study these works properly. While I was stimulated by the Communist Manifesto, I was exhausted by Das\nKapital. But I found myself strongly drawn to the idea of a classless society, which, to my mind, was similar to traditional African culture where life\nwas shared and communal. I subscribed to Marx\u2019s basic dictum, which has the simplicity and generosity of the Golden Rule: \u201cFrom each according\nto his ability; to each according to his needs.\u201d\nDialectical materialism seemed to offer both a searchlight illuminating the dark night of racial oppression and a tool that could be used to end it. It\nhelped me to see the situation other than through the prism of black and white relations, for if our struggle was to succeed, we had to transcend\nblack and white. I was attracted to the scientific underpinnings of dialectical materialism, for I am always inclined to trust what I can verify. Its\nmaterialistic analysis of economics rang true to me. The idea that the value of goods was based on the amount of labor that went into them seemed\nparticularly appropriate for South Africa. The ruling class paid African labor a subsistence wage and then added value to the cost of the goods,\nwhich they retained for themselves.\nMarxism\u2019s call to revolutionary action was music to the ears of a freedom fighter. The idea that history progresses through struggle and change\noccurs in revolutionary jumps was similarly appealing. In my reading of Marxist works, I found a great deal of information that bore on the type of\n\n\fproblems that face a practical politician. Marxists gave serious attention to national liberation movements and the Soviet Union in particular\nsupported the national struggles of many colonial peoples. This was another reason why I amended my view of Communists and accepted the ANC\nposition of welcoming Marxists into its ranks.\nA friend once asked me how I could reconcile my creed of African nationalism with a belief in dialectical materialism. For me, there was no\ncontradiction. I was first and foremost an African nationalist fighting for our emancipation from minority rule and the right to control our own destiny.\nBut at the same time, South Africa and the African continent were part of the larger world. Our problems, while distinctive and special, were not\nentirely unique, and a philosophy that placed those problems in an international and historical context of the greater world and the course of history\nwas valuable. I was prepared to use whatever means to speed up the erasure of human prejudice and the end of chauvinistic and violent\nnationalism. I did not need to become a Communist in order to work with them. I found that African nationalists and African Communists generally\nhad far more uniting them than dividing them. The cynical have always suggested that the Communists were using us. But who is to say that we\nwere not using them? IF WE HAD ANY HOPES or illusions about the National Party before they came into office, we were disabused of them quickly. Their threat to put\nthe kaffir in his place was not an idle one. Apart from the Suppression of Communism Act, two laws passed in  formed the cornerstones of\napartheid: the Population Registration Act and the Group Areas Act. As I have mentioned, the Population Registration Act authorized the\ngovernment officially to classify all South Africans according to race. If it had not already been so, race became the sine qua non of South African\nsociety. The arbitrary and meaningless tests to decide black from Coloured or Coloured from white often resulted in tragic cases where members\nof the same family were classified differently, all depending on whether one child had a lighter or darker complexion. Where one was allowed to live\nand work could rest on such absurd distinctions as the curl of one\u2019s hair or the size of one\u2019s lips.\nThe Group Areas Act was the foundation of residential apartheid. Under its regulations, each racial group could own land, occupy premises, and\ntrade only in its own separate area. Indians could henceforth only live in Indian areas, Africans in African, Coloureds in Coloured. If whites wanted\nthe land or houses of the other groups, they could simply declare the land a white area and take them. The Group Areas Act initiated the era of\nforced removals, when African communities, towns, and villages in newly designated \u201cwhite\u201d urban areas were violently relocated because the\nnearby white landowners did not want Africans living near them or simply wanted their land.\nAt the top of the list for removal was Sophiatown, a vibrant community of more than fifty thousand people, which was one of the oldest black\nsettlements in Johannesburg. Despite its poverty, Sophiatown brimmed with a rich life and was an incubator of so much that was new and valuable\nin African life and culture. Even before the government\u2019s efforts to remove it, Sophiatown held a symbolic importance for Africans disproportionate\nto its small population.\nThe following year, the government passed two more laws that directly attacked the rights of the Coloureds and Africans. The Separate\nRepresentation of Voters Act aimed to transfer Coloureds to a separate voters\u2019 roll in the Cape, thereby diluting the franchise rights that they had\nenjoyed for more than a century. The Bantu Authorities Act abolished the Natives Representative Council, the one indirect forum of national\nrepresentation for Africans, and replaced it with a hierarchical system of tribal chiefs appointed by the government. The idea was to restore power\nto traditional and mainly conservative ethnic leaders in order to perpetuate ethnic differences that were beginning to erode. Both laws epitomized\nthe ethos of the Nationalist government, which pretended to preserve what they were attempting to destroy. Laws stripping people of their rights\nwere inevitably described as laws restoring those rights.\n\nThe Coloured people rallied against the Separate Representation of Voters Act, organizing a tremendous demonstration in Cape Town in March of\n and a strike in April that kept shops closed and schoolchildren at home. It was in the context of this spirit of activism by Indians, Coloureds,\nand Africans that Walter Sisulu first broached the idea to a small group of us of a national civil disobedience campaign. He outlined a plan under\nwhich selected volunteers from all groups would deliberately invite imprisonment by defying certain laws.\nThe idea immediately appealed to me, as it did to the others, but I differed with Walter on the question of who should take part. I had recently\nbecome national president of the Youth League, and in my new role I urged that the campaign should be exclusively African. The average African, I\nsaid, was still cautious about joint action with Indians and Coloureds. While I had made progress in terms of my opposition to communism, I still\nfeared the influence of Indians. In addition, many of our grassroots African supporters saw Indians as exploiters of black labor in their role as\nshopkeepers and merchants.\nWalter vehemently disagreed, suggesting that the Indians, Coloureds, and Africans were inextricably bound together. The issue was taken up at\na meeting of the National Executive Committee and my view was voted down, even by those who were considered staunch African nationalists. But\nI was nevertheless persistent and I raised the matter once more at the national conference in December , where the delegates dismissed my\nview as emphatically as the National Executive Committee had done. Now that my view had been rejected by the highest levels of the ANC, I fully\naccepted the agreed-upon position. While my speech advocating a go-it-alone strategy was met with a lukewarm reception, the speech I gave as\npresident of the Youth League after the league pledged its support for the new policy of cooperation was given a resounding ovation.\nAt the behest of a joint planning council consisting of Dr. Moroka, Walter, J. B. Marks, Yusuf Dadoo, and Yusuf Cachalia, the ANC conference\nendorsed a resolution calling upon the government to repeal the Suppression of Communism Act, the Group Areas Act, the Separate\nRepresentation of Voters Act, the Bantu Authorities Act, the pass laws, and stock limitation laws by February , . The law was intended to\nreduce overgrazing by cattle, but its impact would be to further abridge land for Africans. The council resolved that the ANC would hold\ndemonstrations on April , , as a prelude to the launching of the Campaign for the Defiance of Unjust Laws. That same day white South\nAfricans would be celebrating the three hundredth anniversary of Jan Van Riebeeck\u2019s arrival at the Cape in . April  is the day white South\nAfricans annually commemorate as the founding of their country \u2014 and Africans revile as the beginning of three hundred years of enslavement.\nThe ANC drafted a letter to the prime minister advising him of these resolutions and the deadline for repealing the laws. Because the letter was\nto go out under the name of Dr. Moroka, and Dr. Moroka had not participated in the writing of it, I was instructed to take him the letter by driving to\nhis home in Thaba \u2019Nchu, a town near Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State, a very conservative area of the country. I almost did not make it there\nto see him.\n\nOnly a few weeks before, I had taken my driver\u2019s test. In those days, a driver\u2019s license was an unusual thing for an African, for very few blacks had\ncars. On the appointed day, I borrowed a car to use for the test. I was a bit cocky, and decided to drive the car there myself. I was running late and\nwas driving faster than I should have been, and as I maneuvered the car along a side street that met a main road, I failed to look both ways and\ncollided with a car coming in another direction. The damage was minimal, but now I would certainly be late. The other driver was a reasonable\nfellow and we simply agreed to pay our own expenses.\nWhen I reached the testing station, I observed a white woman ahead of me in the middle of her test. She was driving properly and cautiously.\nWhen the test was finished, the driving inspector said, \u201cThank you. Would you please park the car over there,\u201d gesturing to a space nearby. She\nhad performed the test well enough to pass, but as the woman drove over to the parking place, she did not negotiate a corner properly and the\nback wheel jumped the curb. The inspector hurried over and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, madam, you\u2019ve failed the test; please make another appointment.\u201d I felt\nmy confidence ebbing. If this fellow tricks a white woman into failing her test, what hope would I have? But I performed well on the test, and when the\ninspector told me to park the car at the end of the exam, I drove so carefully that I thought he might penalize me for going too slowly.\nOnce I could legally drive, I became a one-man taxi service. It was one\u2019s obligation to give rides to comrades and friends. I was thus deputized to\ntake the letter to Dr. Moroka. This was no hardship to me as I have always found it enjoyable to gaze out the window while driving. I seemed to have\n\n\fmy best ideas while driving through the countryside with the wind whipping through the window.\nOn my way down to Thaba \u2019Nchu, I passed through Kroonstad, a conservative Free State town about  miles south of Johannesburg. I was\ndriving up a hill and saw two white boys ahead of me on bicycles. My driving was still a bit unsteady, and I came too close to the boys, one of whom\nsuddenly made a turn without signaling, and we collided. He was knocked off his bicycle and was groaning when I got out of the car to help him. He\nhad his arms out signaling for me to pick him up, but just as I was about to do so, a white truck driver yelled for me not to touch the boy. The truck\ndriver scared the child, who then dropped his arms as though he did not want me to pick him up. The boy was not badly hurt, and the truck driver\ntook him to the police station, which was close by.\nThe local police arrived a short time later, and the white sergeant took one look at me and said, \u201cKaffer, jy sal kak vandag!\u201d (Kaffir, you will shit\ntoday!) I was shaken by the accident and the violence of his words, but I told him in no uncertain terms that I would shit when I pleased, not when a\npoliceman told me to. At this, the sergeant took out his notebook to record my particulars. Afrikaans policemen were surprised if a black man could\nspeak English, much less answer back.\nAfter I identified myself, he turned to the car, which he proceeded to ransack. From under the floor mat he pulled out a copy of the left-wing weekly\nThe Guardian, which I had hidden immediately after the accident. (I had slipped the letter for Dr. Moroka inside my shirt.) He looked at the title and\nthen held it up in the air like a pirate with his booty: \u201cWragtig ons her \u2019n Kommunis gevang!\u201d he cried. (My word, we\u2019ve caught a Communist!)\nBrandishing the newspaper, he hurried off.\nThe sergeant returned after about four hours, accompanied by another officer. This sergeant, while also an Afrikaner, was intent on doing his duty\ncorrectly. He said he would need to take measurements at the site of the accident for police records. I told the sergeant that it was not proper to\ntake the measurements at night when the accident had occurred in the daylight. I added that I intended to spend the night in Thaba \u2019Nchu, and that I\ncould not afford to stay in Kroonstad. The sergeant eyed me impatiently and said, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\u201cMandela,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo, the first one,\u201d he said. I told him.\n\u201cNelson,\u201d the sergeant said, as if he were talking to a boy, \u201cI want to help you resume your journey. But if you are going to be difficult with me I will\nhave no alternative but to be difficult with you and lock you up for the night.\u201d That brought me down to earth and I consented to the measurements.\nI resumed my journey late that night, and the next morning I was traveling through the district of Excelsior when my car ground to a halt. I had run\nout of petrol. I walked to a nearby farmhouse and explained in English to an elderly white lady that I would like to buy some petrol. As she was\nclosing the door, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any petrol for you.\u201d I tramped two miles to the next farm and, chastened by my unsuccessful first effort, tried\na different approach. I asked to see the farmer, and when he appeared I assumed a humble demeanor. \u201cMy baas has run out of petrol,\u201d I said.\n(Baas, the Afrikaans word for boss or master, signifies subservience.) Friendly and helpful, the farmer was a relation of Prime Minister Strydom.\nYet, I believe he would have given me the petrol had I told him the truth and not used the hated word baas.\n\nThe meeting with Dr. Moroka proved far less eventful than my journey there. He approved of the letter and I made my way back to Johannesburg\nwithout incident. The letter to the prime minister noted that the ANC had exhausted every constitutional means at our disposal to achieve our\nlegitimate rights, and that we demanded the repeal of the six \u201cunjust laws\u201d by February , , or else we would take extra-constitutional action.\nMalan\u2019s reply, signed by his private secretary, asserted that whites had an inherent right to take measures to preserve their own identity as a\nseparate community, and ended with the threat that if we pursued our actions the government would not hesitate to make full use of its machinery to\nquell any disturbances.\nWe regarded Malan\u2019s curt dismissal of our demands as a declaration of war. We now had no alternative but to resort to civil disobedience, and\nwe embarked on preparations for mass action in earnest. The recruitment and training of volunteers was one of the essential tasks of the campaign\nand would in large part be responsible for its success or failure. On April , preliminary demonstrations took place in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Port\nElizabeth, Durban, and Cape Town. While Dr. Moroka addressed a crowd at Freedom Square in Johannesburg, I spoke to a group of potential\nvolunteers at the Garment Workers Union. I explained to a group of several hundred Africans, Indians, and Coloureds that volunteering was a\ndifficult and even dangerous duty, as the authorities would seek to intimidate, imprison, and perhaps attack the volunteers. No matter what the\nauthorities did, the volunteers could not retaliate, otherwise they would undermine the value of the entire enterprise. They must respond to violence\nwith nonviolence; discipline must be maintained at all cost.\nOn May , the executives of the ANC and the SAIC met in Port Elizabeth and announced that the Defiance Campaign would begin on June ,\nthe anniversary of the first National Day of Protest. They also created a National Action Committee to direct the campaign and a National Volunteer\nBoard to recruit and train volunteers. I was appointed national volunteer-in-chief of the campaign and chairman of both the Action Committee and\nthe Volunteer Board. My responsibilities were to organize the campaign, coordinate the regional branches, canvass for volunteers, and raise funds.\nWe also discussed whether the campaign should follow Gandhian principles of nonviolence, or what the Mahatma called satyagraha, a\nnonviolence that seeks to conquer through conversion. Some argued for nonviolence on purely ethical grounds, saying it was morally superior to\nany other method. This idea was strongly affirmed by Manilal Gandhi, the Mahatma\u2019s son and the editor of the newspaper Indian Opinion, who was\na prominent member of the SAIC. With his gentle demeanor, Gandhi seemed the very personification of nonviolence, and he insisted that the\ncampaign be run along identical lines to that of his father\u2019s in India.\nOthers said that we should approach this issue not from the point of view of principles but of tactics, and that we should employ the method\ndemanded by the conditions. If a particular method or tactic enabled us to defeat the enemy, then it should be used. In this case, the state was far\nmore powerful than we, and any attempts at violence by us would be devastatingly crushed. This made nonviolence a practical necessity rather than\nan option. This was my view, and I saw nonviolence in the Gandhian model not as an inviolable principle but as a tactic to be used as the situation\ndemanded. The principle was not so important that the strategy should be used even when it was self-defeating, as Gandhi himself believed. I\ncalled for nonviolent protest for as long as it was effective. This view prevailed, despite Manilal Gandhi\u2019s strong objections.\nThe joint planning council agreed upon an open-ended program of noncooperation and nonviolence. Two stages of defiance were proposed. In\nthe first stage, a small number of well-trained volunteers would break selected laws in a handful of urban areas. They would enter proscribed areas\nwithout permits, use Whites Only facilities such as toilets, Whites Only railway compartments, waiting rooms, and post office entrances. They would\ndeliberately remain in town after curfew. Each batch of defiers would have a leader who would inform the police in advance of the act of\ndisobedience so that the arrests could take place with a minimum of disturbance. The second stage was envisioned as mass defiance,\naccompanied by strikes and industrial actions across the country.\nPrior to the inauguration of the Defiance Campaign, a rally, called the Day of the Volunteers, was held in Durban on June . Chief Luthuli,\npresident of the Natal ANC, and Dr. Naicker, president of the Natal Indian Congress, both spoke and committed themselves to the campaign. I had\n\n\fdriven down the day before and was the main speaker. About ten thousand people were in attendance, and I told the crowd that the Defiance\nCampaign would be the most powerful action ever undertaken by the oppressed masses in South Africa. I had never addressed such a great\ncrowd before, and it was an exhilarating experience. One cannot speak to a mass of people as one addresses an audience of two dozen. Yet I\nhave always tried to take the same care to explain matters to great audiences as to small ones. I told the people that they would make history and\nfocus the attention of the world on the racist policies of South Africa. I emphasized that unity among the black people \u2014 Africans, Coloureds, and\nIndians \u2014 in South Africa had at last become a reality.\n\nAll across the country, those who defied on June  did so with courage, enthusiasm, and a sense of history. The campaign began in the early\nmorning hours in Port Elizabeth, where thirty-three defiers, under the leadership of Raymond Mhlaba, entered a railway station through a Whites\nOnly entrance and were arrested. They marched in singing freedom songs, to the accompanying cheers of friends and family. In a call and\nresponse, the defiers and the crowd yelled, \u201cMayibuye Afrika!\u201d (Let Africa come back!)\nOn the morning of the twenty-sixth, I was in the ANC office overseeing the day\u2019s demonstrations. The Transvaal batch of volunteers was\nscheduled to go into action at midday at an African township near Boksburg, east of Johannesburg. Led by Reverend N. B. Tantsi, they were to\ncourt arrest by entering the township without permission. Reverend Tantsi was an elderly fellow, a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal\nChurch, and the acting president of the Transvaal ANC.\nIt was late morning, and I was waiting for Reverend Tantsi to arrive from Pretoria, when he telephoned me at the office. With regret in his voice,\nhe told me that his doctor advised him against defying and going to prison. I assured him that we would provide him with warm clothing and that he\nwould spend only a night in jail, but to no avail. This was a grave disappointment, for Reverend Tantsi was a distinguished figure and had been\nselected in order to show the authorities that we were not just a group of young rabble-rousers.\nIn place of Reverend Tantsi, we quickly found someone equally venerable: Nana Sita, the president of the Transvaal Indian Congress, who had\nserved a month in jail for his passive resistance during the  protest campaign. Despite his advanced age and acute arthritis, Sita was a fighter\nand agreed to lead our defiers.\nIn the afternoon, as we were preparing to go to Boksburg, I realized that the secretary of the Transvaal branch of the ANC was nowhere to be\nfound. He was meant to accompany Nana Sita to Boksburg. This was another crisis, and I turned to Walter and said, \u201cYou must go.\u201d This was our\nfirst event in the Transvaal, and it was necessary to have prominent figures lead the defiers, otherwise the leaders would appear to be hanging\nback while the masses took the punishment. Even though Walter was one of the organizers and was scheduled to defy later, he readily agreed. My\nmain concern was that he was wearing a suit, impractical dress for prison, but we managed to find him some old clothes instead.\nWe then left for Boksburg, where Yusuf Cachalia and I planned to deliver a letter to the Boksburg magistrate, advising him that fifty of our\nvolunteers would enter the African township in his area that day without permits. When we arrived at the magistrate\u2019s office, we found a large\ncontingent of pressmen and photographers. As I handed the envelope to the magistrate, the photographers went into action. The magistrate\nshielded himself from the camera flashes and then invited Yusuf and myself into his chambers to discuss the matter privately. He was a reasonable\nman, and said his office was always open to us, but that excessive publicity would only worsen matters.\nFrom the magistrate\u2019s office, we went straight to the township where the demonstration was taking place, and even from half a mile away we\nheard the robust singing of our volunteers and the great crowd of supporters who had come to encourage them. At the scene, we found the high\nmetal gates to the township locked and our volunteers waiting patiently outside, demanding entrance. There were fifty-two volunteers in all, both\nAfricans and Indians, and a crowd of several hundred enthusiastic spectators and journalists. Walter was at the head of the defiers; his presence\nwas evidence that we meant business. But the guiding spirit of the demonstrators was Nana Sita, who, despite his arthritis, was moving among the\ndemonstrators in high spirits, clapping them on the back, and bolstering their confidence with his own.\nFor the first hour there was a standoff. The police were uncharacteristically restrained and their behavior baffled us. Was their restraint a strategy\nto exhaust the volunteers? Were they waiting for the journalists to depart and then stage a massacre under the cover of darkness? Or were they\nfaced with the dilemma that by arresting us \u2014 which is what they would have normally done \u2014 they would be doing the very thing we wanted? But\neven while we were wondering, the situation suddenly changed. The police ordered the gates opened. Immediately the volunteers surged through\nthe gates, thus breaking the law. A police lieutenant blew a whistle and seconds later the police surrounded the volunteers and began arresting\nthem. The campaign was under way. The demonstrators were carted off to the local police station and charged.\nThat same evening, the leaders of the Action Committee, which included Oliver Tambo, Yusuf Cachalia, and myself, attended a meeting in the\ncity to discuss the day\u2019s events and to plan for the week ahead. It was near the area where the second batch of defiers, led by Flag Boshielo,\nchairman of the central branch of the ANC, were courting arrest. Shortly after eleven o\u2019clock, we found them marching in unison in the street; at\neleven, curfew regulations went into effect and Africans needed a permit to be outside.\nWe emerged from our meeting at midnight. I felt exhausted and was thinking not of defiance but of a hot meal and a night\u2019s sleep. At that\nmoment, a policeman approached Yusuf and me. It was obvious that we were going home, not protesting. \u201cNo, Mandela,\u201d the policeman called out.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t escape.\u201d He pointed with his nightstick to the police wagon parked nearby and said, \u201cInto the van.\u201d I felt like explaining to him that I was in\ncharge of running the campaign on a day-to-day basis and was not scheduled to defy and be arrested until much later, but of course, that would\nhave been ridiculous. I watched as he arrested Yusuf, who burst out laughing at the irony of it all. It was a lovely sight to see him smiling as he was\nled away by the police.\nMoments later, Yusuf and I found ourselves among the more than fifty of our volunteers led by Flag Boshielo who were being taken in trucks to the\nred-brick police station known as Marshall Square. As the leaders of the Action Committee, we were worried that the others would wonder at our\nabsence and I was concerned about who would be running the campaign. But spirits were high. Even on the way to prison, the vans swayed to the\nrich voices of the defiers singing \u201cNkosi Sikelel\u2019 iAfrika\u201d (God Bless Africa), the hauntingly beautiful African national anthem.\nThat first night, in the drill yard, one of us was pushed so violently by a white warder that he fell down some steps and broke his ankle. I protested\nto the warder about his behavior, and he lashed out at me by kicking me in the shin. I demanded that the injured man receive medical attention and\nwe initiated a small but vocal demonstration. We were curtly informed that the injured man could make a request for a doctor the next day if he so\nwished. We were aware throughout the night of his acute pain.\nUntil then I had spent bits and pieces of time in prison, but this was my first concentrated experience. Marshall Square was squalid, dark, and\ndingy, but we were all together and so impassioned and spirited that I barely noticed my surroundings. The camaraderie of our fellow defiers made\nthe two days pass very quickly.\n* * *\n\n\fOn that first day of the Defiance Campaign, more than  volunteers around the country violated various unjust laws and were imprisoned. It was\nan auspicious beginning. Our troops were orderly, disciplined, and confident.\nOver the next five months, , people took part in the campaign. Doctors, factory workers, lawyers, teachers, students, ministers, defied and\nwent to jail. They sang, \u201cHey, Malan! Open the jail doors. We want to enter.\u201d The campaign spread throughout the Witwatersrand, to Durban, to Port\nElizabeth, East London, and Cape Town, and smaller towns in the eastern and western Cape. Resistance was beginning to percolate even in the\nrural areas. For the most part, the offenses were minor, and the penalties ranged from no more than a few nights in jail to a few weeks, with the\noption of a fine which rarely exceeded ten pounds. The campaign received an enormous amount of publicity and the membership of the ANC shot\nup from some , to , with the most spectacular increase occurring in the eastern Cape, which contributed half of all new members.\nDuring the six months of the campaign I traveled a great deal throughout the country. I generally went by car, leaving at night or very early in the\nmorning. I toured the Cape, Natal, and the Transvaal, explaining the campaign to small groups, sometimes going from house to house in the\ntownships. Often, my task was to iron out differences in areas that were about to launch actions or had recently done so. In those days, when mass\ncommunication for Africans was primitive or nonexistent, politics were parochial. We had to win people over one by one.\nOn one occasion I drove to the eastern Cape to resolve a dispute involving Alcott Gwentshe, who was running the campaign in East London.\nGwentshe had been a successful shopkeeper and had played an important role in organizing East London for the stay-at-home of June , two\nyears before. He had briefly gone to jail at the beginning of the Defiance Campaign. He was a strong and able man, but he was an individualist who\nignored the advice of the executive and took decisions unilaterally. He was now at odds with his own executive, which was mainly populated with\nintellectuals.\nGwentshe knew how to exploit certain issues in order to discredit his opponents. He would speak before local members who were workers not\nintellectuals, and say \u2014 in Xhosa, never English, for English was the language of the intellectuals \u2014 \u201cComrades, I think you know that I have\nsuffered for the struggle. I had a good job and then went to jail at the beginning of the Defiance Campaign and I lost that job. Now that I am out of\nprison, these intellectuals have come along and said, \u2018Gwentshe, we are better educated than you, we are more capable than you, let us run this\ncampaign.\u2019 \u201d\nWhen I investigated the situation I found that Gwentshe had indeed ignored the advice of the executive. But the people were behind him, and he\nhad created a disciplined and well-organized group of volunteers who had defied in an orderly fashion even while Gwentshe was in prison. Although\nI thought Gwentshe was wrong for disregarding the executive, he was doing a good job and was so firmly entrenched that he could not easily be\ndislodged. When I saw the members of the executive, I explained that it was impractical to do anything about the situation now, but if they wanted to\nremedy it, they must defeat him at the next election. It was one of the first times that I saw that it was foolhardy to go against the masses of people. It\nis no use to take an action to which the masses are opposed, for it will then be impossible to enforce.\n\nThe government saw the campaign as a threat to its security and its policy of apartheid. They regarded civil disobedience not as a form of protest\nbut as a crime, and were perturbed by the growing partnership between Africans and Indians. Apartheid was designed to divide racial groups, and\nwe showed that different groups could work together. The prospect of a united front between Africans and Indians, between moderates and\nradicals, greatly worried them. The Nationalists insisted that the campaign was instigated and led by Communist agitators. The minister of justice\nannounced that he would soon pass legislation to deal with our defiance, a threat he implemented during the  parliamentary session with the\npassage of the Public Safety Act, which empowered the government to declare martial law and to detain people without trial, and the Criminal\nLaws Amendment Act, which authorized corporal punishment for defiers.\nThe government tried a number of underhanded means to interrupt the campaign. Government propagandists repeatedly claimed that the\nleaders of the campaign were living it up in comfort while the masses were languishing in jail. This allegation was far from the truth, but it achieved a\ncertain currency. The government also infiltrated spies and agents provocateurs into the organization. The ANC welcomed virtually anyone who\nwanted to join. In spite of the fact that our volunteers were carefully screened before they were selected to defy, the police managed to penetrate not\nonly our local branches but some of the batches of defiers. When I was arrested and sent to Marshall Square, I noticed two fellows among the\ndefiers, one of whom I had never seen before. He wore unusual prison garb: a suit and tie with an overcoat and a silk scarf. What kind of fellow\ngoes to jail dressed like that? His name was Ramaila, and on the third day when we were due to be released, he simply vanished.\nThe second fellow, whose name was Makhanda, stood out because of his military demeanor. We were out in the courtyard and we were all in\nhigh spirits. The defiers would march in front of Yusuf and myself and salute us. Makhanda, who was tall and slender, marched in a soldierly manner\nand then gave a crisp, graceful salute. A number of the fellows teased him that he must be a policeman to salute so well.\nMakhanda had previously worked as a janitor at ANC headquarters. He was very industrious and was popular among the fellows because he\nwould run out and get fish and chips whenever anyone was hungry. But at a later trial we discovered that both Makhanda and Ramaila were police\nspies. Ramaila testified that he had infiltrated the ranks of the defiers; the trusty Makhanda was actually Detective-Sergeant Motloung.\nAfricans who worked as spies against their own brothers generally did so for money. Many blacks in South Africa believed that any effort by the\nblack man to challenge the white man was foolhardy and doomed to failure; the white man was too smart and too strong. These spies saw us as a\nthreat not to the white power structure but to black interests, for whites would mistreat all blacks based on the conduct of a few agitators.\nYet, there were many black policemen who secretly aided us. They were decent fellows and found themselves in a moral quandary. They were\nloyal to their employer and needed to keep their jobs to support their families, but they were sympathetic to our cause. We had an understanding\nwith a handful of African officers who were members of the security police that they would inform us when there was going to be a police raid.\nThese men were patriots who risked their lives to help the struggle.\nThe government was not our only impediment. Others who might have helped us instead hindered us. At the height of the Defiance Campaign,\nthe United Party sent two of its MPs to urge us to halt the campaign. They said that if we abandoned our campaign in response to a call made by J.\nG. N. Strauss, the United Party leader, it would help the party defeat the Nationalists in the next election. We rejected this and Strauss proceeded to\nattack us with the same scorn used by the Nationalists.\nWe also came under attack from a breakaway ANC group called the National Minded Bloc. Led by Selope Thema, a former member of the\nNational Executive Committee, the group bolted from the ANC when J. B. Marks was elected president of the Transvaal ANC. Thema, who was\neditor of the newspaper the Bantu World, fiercely criticized the campaign in his paper, claiming that Communists had taken over the ANC and that\nIndians were exploiting the Africans. He asserted that the Communists were more dangerous now that they were working underground, and that\nIndian economic interests were in conflict with those of Africans. Although he was in a minority in the ANC, his views got a sympathetic hearing\namong certain radical Youth Leaguers.\n\n\fIn May, during the middle of the Defiance Campaign, J. B. Marks was banned under the  Suppression of Communism Act for \u201cfurthering the\naims of communism.\u201d Banning was a legal order by the government, and generally entailed forced resignation from indicated organizations, and\nrestriction from attending gatherings of any kind. It was a kind of walking imprisonment. To ban a person, the government required no proof, offered\nno charges; the minister of justice simply declared it so. It was a strategy designed to remove the individual from the struggle, allowing him to live a\nnarrowly defined life outside of politics. To violate or ignore a banning order was to invite imprisonment.\nAt the Transvaal conference that year in October, my name was proposed to replace the banned J. B. Marks, who had recommended that I\nsucceed him. I was the national president of the Youth League, and the favorite for Marks\u2019s position, but my candidacy was opposed by a group\nfrom within the Transvaal ANC that called itself \u201cBafabegiya\u201d (Those Who Die Dancing). The group consisted mainly of ex-Communists turned\nextreme African nationalists. They sought to cut all links with Indian activists and to move the ANC in the direction of a more confrontational strategy.\nThey were led by MacDonald Maseko, a former Communist who had been chairman of the Orlando Branch of the ANC during the Defiance\nCampaign, and Seperepere Marupeng, who had been the chief volunteer for the Defiance Campaign in the Witwatersrand. Both Maseko and\nMarupeng intended to stand for the presidency of the Transvaal.\nMarupeng was considered something of a demagogue. He used to wear a military-style khaki suit replete with epaulets and gold buttons, and\ncarried a baton like that made famous by Field Marshal Montgomery. He would stand up in front of meetings, his baton clutched underneath his\narm, and say: \u201cI am tired of waiting for freedom. I want freedom now! I will meet Malan at the crossroads and I will show him what I want.\u201d Then,\nbanging his baton on the podium, he would cry, \u201cI want freedom now!\u201d\nBecause of speeches like these, Marupeng became extremely popular during the Defiance Campaign, but popularity is only one factor in an\nelection. He thought that because of his newfound prominence he would win the presidency. Before the election, when it was known that I would be\na candidate for the presidency, I approached him and said, \u201cI would like you to stand for election to the executive so that you can serve with me\nwhen I am president.\u201d He regarded this as a slight, that I was in effect demoting him, and he refused, choosing instead to run for the presidency\nhimself. But he had miscalculated, for I won the election with an overwhelming majority.\n\nOn July , , at the height of the Defiance Campaign, I was at work at my then law firm of H. M. Basner when the police arrived with a warrant\nfor my arrest. The charge was violation of the Suppression of Communism Act. The state made a series of simultaneous arrests of campaign\nleaders in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth, and Kimberley. Earlier in the month, the police had raided homes and offices of ANC and SAIC officials\nall over the country and confiscated papers and documents. This type of raid was something new and set a pattern for the pervasive and illegal\nsearches that subsequently became a regular feature of the government\u2019s behavior.\nMy arrest and those of the others culminated in a trial in September in Johannesburg of twenty-one accused, including the presidents and\ngeneral-secretaries of the ANC, the SAIC, the ANC Youth League, and the Transvaal Indian Congress. Among the twenty-one on trial in\nJohannesburg were Dr. Moroka, Walter Sisulu, and J. B. Marks. A number of Indian leaders were arrested, including Dr. Dadoo, Yusuf Cachalia,\nand Ahmed Kathrada.\nOur appearances in court became the occasion for exuberant political rallies. Massive crowds of demonstrators marched through the streets of\nJohannesburg and converged on the city\u2019s Magistrate\u2019s Court. There were white students from the University of the Witwatersrand; old ANC\ncampaigners from Alexandra; Indian school-children from primary and secondary schools; people of all ages and colors. The court had never been\ndeluged with such crowds before. The courtroom itself was packed with people, and shouts of \u201cMayibuye Afrika!\u201d punctuated the proceedings.\nThe trial should have been an occasion of resolve and solidarity, but was sullied by a breach of faith by Dr. Moroka. Dr. Moroka, the presidentgeneral of the ANC and the figurehead of the campaign, shocked us all by employing his own attorney. The plan was for all of us to be tried\ntogether. My fellow accused designated me to discuss the matter with Dr. Moroka and attempt to persuade him not to separate himself. The day\nbefore the trial, I went to see Dr. Moroka at Village Deep, Johannesburg.\nAt the outset of our meeting, I suggested alternatives to him, but he was not interested and instead aired a number of grievances. Dr. Moroka felt\nthat he had been excluded from the planning of the campaign. Yet, Moroka was often quite uninterested in ANC affairs and content to be so. But he\nsaid the matter that disturbed him more than any other was that by being defended with the rest of us, he would be associated with men who were\nCommunists. Dr. Moroka shared the government\u2019s animosity to communism. I remonstrated with him and said that it was the tradition of the ANC to\nwork with anyone who was against racial oppression. But Dr. Moroka was unmoved.\nThe greatest jolt came when Dr. Moroka tendered a humiliating plea in mitigation to Judge Rumpff and took the witness stand to renounce the\nvery principles on which the ANC had been founded. Asked whether he thought there should be equality between black and white in South Africa,\nDr. Moroka replied that there would never be such a thing. We felt like slumping in despair in our seats. When his own lawyer asked him whether\nthere were some among the defendants who were Communists, Dr. Moroka actually began to point his finger at various people, including Dr.\nDadoo and Walter. The judge informed him that that was not necessary.\nHis performance was a severe blow to the organization and we all immediately realized that Dr. Moroka\u2019s days as ANC president were\nnumbered. He had committed the cardinal sin of putting his own interests ahead of the organization and the people. He was unwilling to jeopardize\nhis medical career and fortune for his political beliefs, thereby he had destroyed the image that he had built during three years of courageous work\non behalf of the ANC and the Defiance Campaign. I regarded this as a tragedy, for Dr. Moroka\u2019s faintheartedness in court took away some of the\nglow from the campaign. The man who had gone round the country preaching the importance of the campaign had now forsaken it.\nOn December , we were all found guilty of what Judge Rumpff defined as \u201cstatutory communism\u201d \u2014 as opposed to what he said \u201cis commonly\nknown as communism.\u201d According to the statutes of the Suppression of Communism Act, virtually anyone who opposed the government in any way\ncould be defined as \u2014 and therefore convicted of \u2014 being a \u201cstatutory\u201d Communist, even without ever having been a member of the party. The\njudge, who was fair-minded and reasonable, said that although we had planned acts that ranged from \u201copen noncompliance of laws to something\nthat equals high treason,\u201d he accepted that we had consistently advised our members \u201cto follow a peaceful course of action and to avoid violence in\nany shape or form.\u201d We were sentenced to nine months\u2019 imprisonment with hard labor, but the sentence was suspended for two years.\n\nWe made many mistakes, but the Defiance Campaign marked a new chapter in the struggle. The six laws we singled out were not overturned; but\nwe never had any illusion that they would be. We selected them as the most immediate burden pressing on the lives of the people, and the best way\nto engage the greatest number of people in the struggle.\nPrior to the campaign, the ANC was more talk than action. We had no paid organizers, no staff, and a membership that did little more than pay\n\n\flip service to our cause. As a result of the campaign, our membership swelled to ,. The ANC emerged as a truly mass-based organization\nwith an impressive corps of experienced activists who had braved the police, the courts, and the jails. The stigma usually associated with\nimprisonment had been removed. This was a significant achievement, for fear of prison is a tremendous hindrance to a liberation struggle. From\nthe Defiance Campaign onward, going to prison became a badge of honor among Africans.\nWe were extremely proud of the fact that during the six months of the campaign, there was not a single act of violence on our side. The discipline\nof our resisters was exemplary. During the later part of the campaign, riots broke out in Port Elizabeth and East London in which more than forty\npeople were killed. Though these outbreaks had nothing whatsoever to do with the campaign, the government attempted to link us with them. In this,\nthe government was successful, for the riots poisoned the views of some whites who might otherwise have been sympathetic.\nSome within the ANC had unrealistic expectations and were convinced that the campaign could topple the government. We reminded them that\nthe idea of the campaign was to focus attention on our grievances, not eradicate them. They argued that we had the government where we wanted\nthem, and that we should continue the campaign indefinitely. I stepped in and said that this government was too strong and too ruthless to be\nbrought down in such a manner. We could embarrass them, but overthrowing them as a result of the Defiance Campaign was impossible.\nAs it was, we continued the campaign for too long. We should have listened to Dr. Xuma. The Planning Committee met with Dr. Xuma during the\ntail end of the campaign and he told us that the campaign would soon lose momentum and it would be wise to call it off before it fizzled out\naltogether. To halt the campaign while it was still on the offensive would be a shrewd move that would capture the headlines. Dr. Xuma was right:\nthe campaign soon slackened, but in our enthusiasm and even arrogance, we brushed aside his advice. My heart wanted to keep the campaign\ngoing but my head told me that it should stop. I argued for closure but went along with the majority. By the end of the year, the campaign foundered.\nThe campaign never expanded beyond the initial stage of small batches of mostly urban defiers. Mass defiance, especially in the rural areas,\nwas never achieved. The eastern Cape was the only region where we succeeded in reaching the second stage and where a strong resistance\nmovement emerged in the countryside. In general, we did not penetrate the countryside, an historical weakness of the ANC. The campaign was\nhampered by the fact that we did not have any full-time organizers. I was attempting to organize the campaign and practice as a lawyer at the same\ntime, and that is no way to wage a mass campaign. We were still amateurs.\nI nevertheless felt a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction: I had been engaged in a just cause and had the strength to fight for it and\nwin. The campaign freed me from any lingering sense of doubt or inferiority I might still have felt; it liberated me from the feeling of being\noverwhelmed by the power and seeming invincibility of the white man and his institutions. But now the white man had felt the power of my punches\nand I could walk upright like a man, and look everyone in the eye with the dignity that comes from not having succumbed to oppression and fear. I\nhad come of age as a freedom fighter. AT THE ANC annual conference at the end of , there was a changing of the guard. The ANC designated a new, more vigorous president for a\nnew, more activist era: Chief Albert Luthuli. In accordance with the ANC constitution, as provisional president of the Transvaal, I became one of the\nfour deputy presidents. Furthermore, the National Executive Committee appointed me as first deputy president, in addition to my position as\npresident of the Transvaal. Luthuli was one of a handful of ruling chiefs who were active in the ANC and had staunchly resisted the policies of the\ngovernment.\nThe son of a Seventh-Day Adventist missionary, Luthuli was born in what was then Southern Rhodesia and educated in Natal. He trained as a\nteacher at Adam\u2019s College near Durban. A fairly tall, heavyset, dark-skinned man with a great broad smile, he combined an air of humility with\ndeep-seated confidence. He was a man of patience and fortitude, who spoke slowly and clearly as though every word was of equal importance.\nI had first met him in the late s when he was a member of the Natives Representative Council. In September of , only a few months\nbefore the annual conference, Luthuli had been summoned to Pretoria and given an ultimatum: he must either renounce his membership in the ANC\nand his support of the Defiance Campaign, or he would be dismissed from his position as an elected and government-paid tribal chief. Luthuli was\na teacher, a devout Christian, and a proud Zulu chief, but he was even more firmly committed to the struggle against apartheid. Luthuli refused to\nresign from the ANC and the government dismissed him from his post. In response to his dismissal, he issued a statement of principles called \u201cThe\nRoad to Freedom Is via the Cross,\u201d in which he reaffirmed his support for nonviolent passive resistance and justified his choice with words that still\necho plaintively today: \u201cWho will deny that thirty years of my life have been spent knocking in vain, patiently, moderately and modestly at a closed\nand barred door?\u201d\nI supported Chief Luthuli, but I was unable to attend the national conference. A few days before the conference was to begin, fifty-two leaders\naround the country were banned from attending any meetings or gatherings for six months. I was among those leaders, and my movements were\nrestricted to the district of Johannesburg for that same period.\nMy bans extended to meetings of all kinds, not just political ones. I could not, for example, attend my son\u2019s birthday party. I was prohibited from\ntalking to more than one person at a time. This was part of a systematic effort by the government to silence, persecute, and immobilize the leaders\nof those fighting apartheid and was the first of a series of bans on me that continued with brief intervals of freedom until the time I was deprived of\nall freedom some years hence.\nBanning not only confines one physically, it imprisons one\u2019s spirit. It induces a kind of psychological claustrophobia that makes one yearn not only\nfor freedom of movement but spiritual escape. Banning was a dangerous game, for one was not shackled or chained behind bars; the bars were\nlaws and regulations that could easily be violated and often were. One could slip away unseen for short periods of time and have the temporary\nillusion of freedom. The insidious effect of bans was that at a certain point one began to think that the oppressor was not without but within.\n\nAlthough I was prevented from attending the  annual conference, I was immediately informed as to what had transpired. One of the most\nsignificant decisions was one taken in secret and not publicized at the time.\nAlong with many others, I had become convinced that the government intended to declare the ANC and the SAIC illegal organizations, just as it\nhad done with the Communist Party. It seemed inevitable that the state would attempt to put us out of business as a legal organization as soon as it\ncould. With this in mind, I approached the National Executive Committee with the idea that we must come up with a contingency plan for just such\nan eventuality. I said it would be an abdication of our responsibility as leaders of the people if we did not do so. They instructed me to draw up a\nplan that would enable the organization to operate from underground. This strategy came to be known as the Mandela-Plan, or simply, M-Plan.\nThe idea was to set up organizational machinery that would allow the ANC to make decisions at the highest level, which could then be swiftly\ntransmitted to the organization as a whole without calling a meeting. In other words, it would allow an illegal organization to continue to function and\nenable leaders who were banned to continue to lead. The M-Plan was designed to allow the organization to recruit new members, respond to local\nand national problems, and maintain regular contact between the membership and the underground leadership.\nI held a number of secret meetings among ANC and SAIC leaders, both banned and not banned, to discuss the parameters of the plan. I worked\non it for a number of months and came up with a system that was broad enough to adapt itself to local conditions and not fetter individual initiative,\nbut detailed enough to facilitate order. The smallest unit was the cell, which in urban townships consisted of roughly ten houses on a street. A cell\nsteward would be in charge of each of these units. If a street had more than ten houses, a street steward would take charge and the cell stewards\nwould report to him. A group of streets formed a zone directed by a chief steward, who was in turn responsible to the secretariat of the local branch\nof the ANC. The secretariat was a subcommittee of the branch executive, which reported to the provincial secretary. My notion was that every cell\nand street steward should know every person and family in his area, so that he would be trusted by the people and would know whom to trust. The\ncell steward arranged meetings, organized political classes, and collected dues. He was the linchpin of the plan. Although the strategy was\nprimarily created for more urban areas, it could be adapted to rural ones.\n\nThe plan was accepted, and was to be implemented immediately. Word went out to the branches to begin to prepare for this covert restructuring.\nThe plan was accepted at most branches, but some of the more far-flung outposts felt that the plan was an effort by Johannesburg to centralize\ncontrol over the regions.\nAs part of the M-Plan, the ANC introduced an elementary course of political lectures for its members throughout the country. These lectures were\nmeant not only to educate but to hold the organization together. The lectures were given in secret by branch leaders. Those members in attendance\nwould in turn give the same lectures to others in their homes and communities. In the beginning, the lectures were not systemized, but within a\nnumber of months there was a set curriculum.\nThere were three courses, \u201cThe World We Live In,\u201d \u201cHow We Are Governed,\u201d and \u201cThe Need for Change.\u201d In the first course, we discussed the\ndifferent types of political and economic systems around the world as well as in South Africa. It was an overview of the growth of capitalism as well\nas socialism. We discussed, for example, how blacks in South Africa were oppressed both as a race and an economic class. The lecturers were\nmostly banned members, and I myself frequently gave lectures in the evening. This arrangement had the virtue of keeping banned individuals active\nas well as keeping the membership in touch with these leaders.\nDuring this time, the banned leadership would often meet secretly and alone, and then arrange to meet the present leaders. The old and the new\nleadership meshed very well, and the decision-making process was collective as it had been before. Sometimes it felt as if nothing had changed\nexcept that we had to meet in secret.\n\n\fThe M-Plan was conceived with the best intentions, but it was instituted with only modest success and its adoption was never widespread. The\nmost impressive results were once again in the eastern Cape and Port Elizabeth. The spirit of the Defiance Campaign continued in the eastern\nCape long after it vanished elsewhere, and ANC members there seized on the M-Plan as a way of continuing to defy the government.\nThe plan faced many problems: it was not always adequately explained to the membership; there were no paid organizers to help implement or\nadminister it; and there was often dissension within branches that prevented agreement on imposing the plan. Some provincial leaders resisted it\nbecause they believed it undermined their power. To some, the government\u2019s crackdown did not seem imminent so they did not take the\nprecautions necessary to lessen its effect. When the government\u2019s iron fist did descend, they were not prepared. IN EARLY SEPTEMBER , my bans expired. I had last had a holiday in  when I was an untested lightweight in the ANC with few\nresponsibilities beyond attending meetings in the Transvaal executive and addressing the odd public gathering. Now, at the age of thirty-eight, I had\nreached the light heavyweight division and carried more pounds and more responsibility. I had been confined to Johannesburg for two years,\nchained to my legal and political work, and had neglected Mandela family affairs in the Transkei. I was keen to visit the countryside again, to be in\nthe open veld and rolling valleys of my childhood. I was anxious to see my family and confer with Sabata and Daliwonga on certain problems\ninvolving the Transkei, while the ANC was eager that I confer with them on political matters. I was to have a working holiday, the only kind of holiday I\nknew how to take.\nThe night before I left, a number of friends gathered at my home to see me off. Duma Nokwe, the young and good-natured barrister who was then\nnational secretary of the Youth League, was among them. Duma had accompanied Walter on his trip to the Youth Conference in Bucharest, and\nthat night he entertained us with the Russian and Chinese songs he had learned on his trip. At midnight, as my guests were getting ready to leave,\nmy daughter Makaziwe, then two, awoke and asked me if she could come along with me. I had been spending insufficient time with my family and\nMakaziwe\u2019s request provoked pangs of guilt. Suddenly, my enthusiasm for my trip vanished. But I carried her back to bed and kissed her good\nnight and as she dropped off to sleep, I made my final preparations for my journey.\nI was embarking on a fact-finding mission, which I would combine with the pleasures of seeing the countryside and old friends and comrades. I\nhad been isolated from developments in other parts of the country and was eager to see for myself what was transpiring in the hinterlands. Although\nI read a variety of newspapers from around the country, newspapers are only a poor shadow of reality; their information is important to a freedom\nfighter not because it reveals the truth, but because it discloses the biases and perceptions of both those who produce the paper and those who\nread it. On this trip I wanted to talk firsthand with our people in the field.\nI left shortly after midnight and within an hour I was on the highway to Durban. The roads were empty and I was accompanied only by the stars and\ngentle Transvaal breezes. Though I had not slept, I felt lighthearted and fresh. At daybreak I crossed from Volksrust to Natal, the country of\nCetywayo, the last independent king of the Zulus, whose troops had defeated a British column at Isandhlwana in . But the king was unable to\nwithstand the firepower of the British and eventually surrendered his kingdom. Shortly after crossing the river on the Natal border I saw the Majuba\nHills, the steep escarpment where a small Boer commando ambushed and defeated a garrison of British redcoats less than two years after the\ndefeat of Cetywayo. At Majuba Hill the Afrikaner had stoutly defended his independence against British imperialism and struck a blow for\nnationalism. Now the descendants of those same freedom fighters were persecuting my people who were struggling for precisely the same thing\nthe Afrikaners had once fought and died for. I drove through those historic hills thinking less of the ironies of history by which the oppressed\nbecomes the oppressor, than of how the ruthless Afrikaners deserved their own Majuba Hill at the hands of my people.\nThis harsh reverie was interrupted by the happy music of Radio Bantu on my car radio. While I despised the conservative politics of Radio Bantu\nserved up by the government-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, I reveled in its music. (In South Africa, African artists made the music,\nbut white record companies made the money.) I was listening to a popular program called \u201cRediffusion Service,\u201d which featured most of the\ncountry\u2019s leading African singers: Miriam Makeba, Dolly Rathebe, Dorothy Masuku, Thoko Shukuma, and the smooth sound of the Manhattan\nBrothers. I enjoy all types of music, but the music of my own flesh and blood goes right to my heart. The curious beauty of African music is that it\nuplifts even as it tells a sad tale. You may be poor, you may have only a ramshackle house, you may have lost your job, but that song gives you\nhope. African music is often about the aspirations of the African people, and it can ignite the political resolve of those who might otherwise be\nindifferent to politics. One merely has to witness the infectious singing at African rallies. Politics can be strengthened by music, but music has a\npotency that defies politics.\nI made a number of stops in Natal, meeting secretly with ANC leaders. Nearing Durban, I took the opportunity of stopping in Pietermaritzburg,\nwhere I spent the entire night with Dr. Chota Motala, Moses Mabhida, and others, reviewing the political situation in the country. I then traveled on to\nGroutville, spending the day with Chief Luthuli. Although he had been confined by banning orders for more than a year, the chief was well-informed\nabout ANC activities. He was uneasy about what he saw as the increasing centralization of the ANC in Johannesburg and the declining power of\nthe regions. I reassured him that we wanted the regions to remain strong.\nMy next stop was a meeting in Durban with Dr. Naicker and the Executive Committee of the Natal Indian Congress, where I raised the sensitive\nissue that the National Executive Committee believed that the Indian Congress had become inactive of late. I was reluctant to do this as Dr. Naicker\nwas my senior and a man who had suffered far more than I, but we discussed ways to overcome government restrictions.\nFrom Durban I drove south along the coast past Port Shepstone and Port St. Johns, small and lovely colonial towns that dotted the shimmering\nbeaches fronting the Indian Ocean. While mesmerized by the beauty of the area, I was constantly rebuked by the buildings and streets that bear the\nnames of white imperialists who suppressed the very people whose names belonged there. At this point, I turned inland and drove to Umzimkulu to\nmeet with Dr. Conco, the treasurer-general of the ANC, for further discussions and consultations.\nWith excitement mounting, I then set off for Umtata. When I turned into York Road, the main street of Umtata, I felt the rush of familiarity and fond\nmemories one gets from coming home after a long exile. I had been away for thirteen years, and while there were no banners and fatted calves to\ngreet this prodigal son upon his return, I was tremendously excited to see my mother, my humble home, and the friends of my youth. But my trip to\nthe Transkei had a second motive: my arrival coincided with the meeting of a special committee appointed to oversee the transition of the\nTranskeian Bunga system to that of the Bantu Authorities.\nThe role of the Bunga, which consisted of  members, one-quarter of whom were white and three-quarters African, was to advise the\ngovernment on legislation affecting Africans in the area and to regulate local matters like taxes and roads. While the Bunga was the most influential\npolitical body in the Transkei, its resolutions were advisory and its decisions subject to review by white magistrates. The Bunga was only as\npowerful as whites permitted it to be. Yet, the Bantu Authorities Act would replace it with an even more repressive system: a feudalistic order\nresting on hereditary and tribal distinctions as decided by the state. The government suggested that Bantu Authorities would free the people from\nthe control of white magistrates, but this was a smoke screen for the state\u2019s undermining of democracy and promotion of tribal rivalries. The ANC\nregarded any acceptance of Bantu Authorities as a capitulation to the government.\nOn the night of my arrival, I met briefly with a number of Transkeian councillors and my nephew, K. D. Matanzima, whom I called Daliwonga.\nDaliwonga was playing a leading part in persuading the Bunga to accept Bantu Authorities, for the new order would reinforce and even increase his\npower as the chief of Emigrant Thembuland. Daliwonga and I were on separate sides of this difficult issue. We had grown apart: he had opted for a\ntraditional leadership role and was cooperating with the system. But it was late, and rather than begin a lengthy discussion, we resolved to meet the\nfollowing day.\nI spent that night in a boardinghouse in town, rose early, and was joined for coffee in my room by two local chiefs to discuss their role in the new\n\n\fBantu Authorities. In the middle of our conversation the mistress of the boardinghouse nervously ushered a white man into my room. \u201cAre you\nNelson Mandela?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cAnd who is asking?\u201d I said.\nHe gave his name and rank as a detective sergeant in the security police.\n\u201cMay I see your warrant, please?\u201d I asked. It was obvious the sergeant resented my audacity, but he grudgingly produced an official document.\nYes, I was Nelson Mandela, I told him. He informed me that the commanding officer wanted to see me. I replied that if he wanted to see me he knew\nwhere I was. He then ordered me to accompany him to the police station. I asked him whether I was under arrest, and he replied that I was not.\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d I said, \u201cI am not going.\u201d He was taken aback by my refusal but knew I was on firm legal ground. He proceeded to fire a succession\nof questions at me: when had I left Johannesburg? where had I visited? whom had I spoken with? did I have a permit to enter the Transkei and how\nlong would I be staying? I informed him that the Transkei was my home and that I did not need a permit to enter it. The sergeant stomped out of the\nroom.\nThe chiefs were taken aback by my behavior and upbraided me for my rudeness. I explained that I had merely treated him in the manner that he\nhad treated me. The chiefs were unconvinced, and clearly thought I was a hotheaded young man who would get himself in trouble. These were men\nI was trying to persuade to reject Bantu Authorities, and it was apparent that I had not made a very good impression. The incident reminded me that\nI had returned to my homeland a different man from the one who had left thirteen years before.\nThe police were unsophisticated in the Transkei, and from the moment I left the boardinghouse, they followed me everywhere I went. After I talked\nto anyone, the police would confront the person and say, \u201cIf you talk with Mandela, we will come and arrest you.\u201d\nI met briefly with a local ANC leader and was dismayed to learn of the organization\u2019s lack of funds, but at that moment, I was thinking less about\nthe organization than my next stop: Qunu, the village where I was raised and where my mother still lived.\nI roused my mother, who at first looked as though she was seeing a ghost. But she was overjoyed. I had brought some food \u2014 fruit, meat, sugar,\nsalt, and a chicken \u2014 and my mother lit the stove to make tea. We did not hug or kiss; that was not our custom. Although I was happy to be back, I\nfelt a sense of guilt at the sight of my mother living all alone in such poor circumstances. I tried to persuade her to come live with me in\nJohannesburg, but she swore that she would not leave the countryside she loved. I wondered \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 whether one was ever\njustified in neglecting the welfare of one\u2019s own family in order to fight for the welfare of others. Can there be anything more important than looking\nafter one\u2019s aging mother? Is politics merely a pretext for shirking one\u2019s responsibilities, an excuse for not being able to provide in the way one\nwanted?\nAfter an hour or so with my mother, I left to spend the night at Mqhekezweni. It was night when I arrived, and in my enthusiasm I started to blow the\nhorn of my car. I had not considered how this noise might be interpreted and people emerged fearfully from their huts, thinking it might be the police.\nBut when I was recognized, I was met with surprise and joy by a number of villagers.\nBut instead of sleeping like a child in my old bed, I tossed and turned that night wondering whether or not I had taken the right path. But I did not\ndoubt that I had chosen correctly. I do not mean to suggest that the freedom struggle is of a higher moral order than taking care of one\u2019s family. It is\nnot; they are merely different.\nReturning to Qunu the next morning, I spent the day reminiscing with people, and walking the fields around the village. I also visited with my sister\nMabel, the most practical and easygoing of my sisters and of whom I was very fond. Mabel was married, but her union involved an interesting tale.\nMy sister Baliwe, who was older than Mabel, had been engaged to be married, and lobola had already been paid. But two weeks before the\nwedding, Baliwe, who was a spirited girl, ran away. We could not return the cattle, as they had already been accepted, so the family decided that\nMabel would take Baliwe\u2019s place, and she did so.\nI left late that afternoon to drive to Mqhekezweni. Again I arrived at night and announced my presence with loud hooting, only this time people\nemerged from their homes with the idea that Justice, their chief, had returned. Justice had been deposed from his chieftaincy by the government\nand was then living in Durban. Though the government had appointed someone in his stead, a chief is a chief by virtue of his birth and wields\nauthority because of his blood. They were happy to see me, but they would have been happier still welcoming home Justice.\nMy second mother, No-England, the widow of the regent, had been fast asleep when I arrived, but when she appeared in her nightdress and saw\nme, she became so excited she demanded I drive her immediately to a nearby relative to celebrate. She hopped into my car and we set off on a\nwild ride through the untamed veld, to get to the remote rondavel of her relative. There we woke up another family, and I finally went to sleep, tired\nand happy, just before dawn.\nOver the next fortnight I moved back and forth between Qunu and Mqhekezweni, staying by turns with my mother and No-England, visiting and\nreceiving friends and relatives. I ate the same foods I had eaten as a boy, I walked the same fields, and gazed at the same sky during the day, the\nsame stars at night. It is important for a freedom fighter to remain in touch with his own roots, and the hurly-burly of city life has a way of erasing the\npast. The visit restored me and revived my feelings for the place in which I grew up. I was once again my mother\u2019s son in her house; I was once\nagain the regent\u2019s charge in the Great Place.\nThe visit was also a way of measuring the distance I had come. I saw how my own people had remained in one place, while I had moved on and\nseen new worlds and gained new ideas. If I had not realized it before, I knew that I was right not to have returned to the Transkei after Fort Hare. If I\nhad returned, my political evolution would have been stunted.\nWhen the Special Committee considering the introduction of the Bantu Authorities had adjourned, Daliwonga and I went to visit Sabata in\nhospital in Umtata. I had hoped to talk with Sabata about the Bantu Authorities, but his health made it impossible. I wanted Sabata and his brother,\nDaliwonga, to begin talks on this issue as soon as Sabata was well enough to do so, and made this clear. I felt proud to be organizing a meeting\nbetween the descendants of Ngubengcuka, and mused for a moment on the irony that I was finally fulfilling the role of counselor to Sabata for which\nI\u2019d been groomed so many years before.\nFrom Umtata, Daliwonga and I drove to Qamata, where we met his younger brother George, who was then a practicing attorney. His two articled\nclerks were well known to me and I was pleased to see them both: A. P. Mda and Tsepo Letlaka. Both were still firm supporters of the organization\nwho had given up teaching and decided to become lawyers. In Qamata, we all sat down to examine the issue of the proposed Bantu Authorities.\nMy mission was to persuade Daliwonga \u2014 a man destined to play a leading role in the politics of the Transkei \u2014 to oppose the imposition of the\nBantu Authorities. I did not want our meeting to be a showdown, or even a debate; I did not want any grandstanding or faultfinding, but a serious\ndiscussion among men who all had the best interests of their people and their nation at heart.\nIn many ways, Daliwonga still regarded me as his junior, both in terms of my rank in the Thembu hierarchy and in my own political development.\nWhile I was his junior in the former realm, I believed I had advanced beyond my onetime mentor in my political views. Whereas his concerns\nfocused on his own tribe, I had become involved with those who thought in terms of the entire nation. I did not want to complicate the discussion by\nintroducing grand political theories; I would rely on common sense and the facts of our history. Before we began, Daliwonga invited Mda and\nLetlaka and his brother, George, to participate, but they demurred, preferring to listen to the two of us. \u201cLet the nephew and the uncle conduct the\n\n\fdebate,\u201d Mda said as a sign of respect. Etiquette dictated that I would make my case first and he would not interrupt; then he would answer while I\nlistened.\nIn the first place, I said, the Bantu Authorities was impractical, because more and more Africans were moving out of the rural homelands to the\ncities. The government\u2019s policy was to try to put Africans into ethnic enclaves because they feared the power of African unity. The people, I said,\nwanted democracy, and political leadership based on merit not birth. The Bantu Authorities was a retreat from democracy.\nDaliwonga\u2019s response was that he was trying to restore the status of his royal house that had been crushed by the British. He stressed the\nimportance and vitality of the tribal system and traditional leadership, and did not want to reject a system that enshrined those things. He, too,\nwanted a free South Africa but he thought that goal could be achieved faster and more peacefully through the government\u2019s policy of separate\ndevelopment. The ANC, he said, would bring about bloodshed and bitterness. He ended by saying that he was startled and disturbed to learn that\nin spite of my own position in the Thembu royal house I did not support the principle of traditional leadership.\nWhen Daliwonga finished, I replied that while I understood his personal position as a chief quite well, I believed that his own interests were in\nconflict with those of the community. I said that if I were in a similar position to his, I would try to subordinate my own interests to those of the people.\nI immediately regretted that last point because I have discovered that in discussions it never helps to take a morally superior tone to one\u2019s\nopponent. I noticed that Daliwonga stiffened when I made this point and I quickly shifted the discussion to more general issues.\nWe spoke the whole night, but came no closer to each other\u2019s position. As the sun was rising, we parted. We had embarked on different roads\nthat put us in conflict with one another. This grieved me because few men had inspired me as Daliwonga had, and nothing would have given me\ngreater joy than to fight beside him. But it was not to be. On family issues, we remained friends; politically, we were in opposite and antagonistic\ncamps.\nI returned to Qunu that morning and spent another few days there. I tramped across the veld to visit friends and relatives, but the magic world of\nmy childhood had fled. One evening I bade my mother and sister farewell. I visited Sabata in hospital to wish him a speedy recovery, and by  A.M. I\nwas on my way to Cape Town. The bright moonlight and crisp breeze kept me fresh all the way across the Kei River. The road winds up the rugged\nmountains, and as the sun rose my mood lifted. I had last been on that road eighteen years before, when Jongintaba had driven me to Healdtown.\nI was driving slowly when I noticed a limping man at the side of the road raising his hand to me. I instinctively pulled over and offered him a ride.\nHe was about my own age, of small stature, and rather unkempt; he had not bathed in quite a while. He told me that his car had broken down on the\nother side of Umtata and he had been walking for several days toward Port Elizabeth. I noticed a number of inconsistencies in his story, and I\nasked him the make of his car. A Buick, he replied. And the registration? I said. He told me a number. A few minutes later, I said, \u201cWhat did you say\nthat registration number was?\u201d He told me a slightly different figure. I suspected he was a policeman, and I decided to say very little.\nMy reserve went unnoticed by my companion as he talked the entire way to Port Elizabeth. He pointed out various curiosities and was well\nversed in the history of the region. He never asked who I was and I did not tell him. But he was entertaining, and I found his conversation useful and\ninteresting.\nI made a stop in East London and spoke to a few ANC people. Before leaving I had a conversation with some other people in the township, one\nof whom struck me as an undercover policeman. My companion had learned my identity, and a few minutes after we were back in the car, he said\nto me, \u201cYou know, Mandela, I suspected that one chap at the end was a policeman.\u201d This raised my own suspicions, and I said to my companion,\n\u201cLook here, how do I know you\u2019re not a policeman yourself? You must tell me who you are \u2014 otherwise I will dump you back on the road again.\u201d\nHe protested and said, \u201cNo, I will introduce myself properly.\u201d He confessed that he was a smuggler and had been carrying dagga (marijuana)\nfrom the Pondoland coast when he ran into a police roadblock. When he saw the roadblock, he jumped out of the car and tried to make a break for\nit. The police fired, wounding him in the leg. That explained his limp and his lack of transportation. He waved me down because he assumed the\npolice were hunting for him.\nI asked him why he had chosen such a dangerous livelihood. He had originally wanted to be a teacher, he told me, but his parents were too poor\nto send him to college. After school he had worked in a factory, but the wages were too meager for him to live on his own. He started to supplement\nthem by smuggling dagga, and soon found it so profitable that he left the factory altogether. He said in any other country in the world he would have\nfound an opportunity for his talents. \u201cI saw white men who were my inferiors in ability and brains earning fifty times what I was.\u201d After a long pause,\nhe announced in a solemn tone, \u201cI am also a member of the ANC.\u201d He told me that he had defied during the  Defiance Campaign and had\nserved on various local committees in Port Elizabeth. I quizzed him on various personalities, all of whom he seemed to know, and later in Port\nElizabeth I confirmed that he was telling me the truth. In fact, he had been one of the most reliable of those who went to jail during the Defiance\nCampaign. The doors of the liberation struggle are open to all who choose to walk through them.\nAs an attorney with a fairly large criminal practice, I was conversant with such tales. Over and over again, I saw men as bright and talented as my\ncompanion resort to crime in order to make ends meet. While I do think certain individuals are disposed to crime because of their genetic\ninheritance or an abusive upbringing, I am convinced that apartheid turned many otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals. It stands to reason\nthat an immoral and unjust legal system would breed contempt for its laws and regulations.\nWe reached Port Elizabeth at sunset, and Joe Matthews, Z. K. Matthews\u2019s son, arranged accommodation. The next morning I met with Raymond\nMhlaba, Frances Baard, and Govan Mbeki, whom I was meeting for the first time. I knew his work, for as a student I had read his booklet \u201cThe\nTranskei in the Making.\u201d He had been running a cooperative store in the Transkei which he was soon to give up to become an editor of the weekly\nNew Age. Govan was serious, thoughtful, and soft-spoken, equally at home in the world of scholarship and the world of political activism. He had\nbeen deeply involved in the planning of the Congress of the People and was destined for the highest levels of leadership in the organization.\nI departed in the late morning for Cape Town, with only my radio for company. I had never before driven on roads between Port Elizabeth and\nCape Town, and I was looking forward to many miles of entrancing scenery. It was hot, and the road was bordered by dense vegetation on either\nside. I had hardly left the city when I ran over a large snake slithering across the road. I am not superstitious and do not believe in omens, but the\ndeath of the snake did not please me. I do not like killing any living thing, even those creatures that fill some people with dread.\nOnce I passed Humansdorp, the forests became denser and for the first time in my life I saw wild elephants and baboons. A large baboon\ncrossed the road in front of me, and I stopped the car. He stood and stared at me as intently as if he were a Special Branch detective. It was ironic\nthat I, an African, was seeing the Africa of storybooks and legend for the first time. Such beautiful land, I thought, and all of it out of reach, owned by\nwhites and untouchable for a black man. I could no more choose to live in such beauty than run for Parliament.\nSeditious thoughts accompany a freedom fighter wherever he goes. At the town of Knysna, more than a hundred miles west of Port Elizabeth, I\nstopped to survey the surroundings. The road above the town affords a panoramic view as far as the eye can see. In every direction, I saw\nsprawling, dense forests and I dwelt not on the greenery but the fact that there were many places a guerrilla army could live and train undetected.\nI arrived in Cape Town at midnight for what turned out to be a two-week stay. I stayed at the home of Reverend Walter Teka, a leader in the\nMethodist Church, but I spent most of my days with Johnson Ngwevela and Greenwood Ngotyana. Ngwevela was the chairman of the Cape\nwestern region of the ANC and Ngotyana a member of its executive. Both were Communists as well as leading members of the Wesleyan Church. I\n\n\ftraveled every day to meet ANC officials in places like Worcester, Paarl, Stellenbosch, Simonstown, and Hermanus. I planned to work each day of\nmy stay and when I asked what had been arranged for Sunday \u2014 a working day for me in the Transvaal \u2014 they informed me that the sabbath was\nreserved for churchgoing. I protested, but to no avail. Communism and Christianity, at least in Africa, were not mutually exclusive.\nWhile I was walking in the city one day, I noticed a white woman in the gutter gnawing on some fish bones. She was poor and apparently\nhomeless, but she was young and not unattractive. I knew of course that there were poor whites, whites who were every bit as poor as Africans, but\none rarely saw them. I was used to seeing black beggars on the street, and it startled me to see a white one. While I normally did not give to African\nbeggars, I felt the urge to give this woman money. In that moment I realized the tricks that apartheid plays on one, for the everyday travails that afflict\nAfricans are accepted as a matter of course, while my heart immediately went out to this bedraggled white woman. In South Africa, to be poor and\nblack was normal, to be poor and white was a tragedy.\n* * *\nAs I was preparing to leave Cape Town, I went to the offices of New Age to see some old friends and discuss their editorial policy. New Age, the\nsuccessor to earlier banned left-wing publications, was a friend of the ANC. It was early in the morning of the twenty-seventh of September, and as I\nwalked up the steps I could hear angry voices inside the office and furniture being moved. I recognized the voice of Fred Carneson, the manager of\nthe newspaper and its guiding spirit. I also heard the gruff voices of the security police who were in the process of searching the offices. I quietly left,\nand later discovered that this had not been an isolated incident but part of the largest nationwide raid undertaken in South African history. Armed\nwith warrants authorizing the seizure of anything regarded as evidence of high treason, sedition, or violations of the Suppression of Communism\nAct, the police searched more than five hundred people in their homes and offices around the country. My office in Johannesburg was searched, as\nwell as the homes of Dr. Moroka, Father Huddleston, and Professor Matthews.\nThe raid cast a shadow over my last day in Cape Town, for it signaled the first move in the state\u2019s new and even more repressive strategy. At the\nvery least, a new round of bannings would take place, and I was certain to be among them. That evening, Reverend Teka and his wife had a\nnumber of people over to the house to bid me farewell, and led by the reverend, we knelt in prayer for the well-being of those whose homes had\nbeen raided. I left the house at my favored departure time of  A.M., and within half an hour I was on the road to Kimberley, the rough-and-ready\nmining town where the South African diamond business had begun in the last century.\nI was to stay at the home of Dr. Arthur Letele for one night. Later to become the treasurer-general of the ANC, Arthur was a scrupulous medical\npractitioner. I had a cold, and when he greeted me on my arrival, he confined me to bed. He was a brave and dedicated man, and had led a small\ngroup of defiers to jail during the Defiance Campaign. This was a risky action for a doctor in a town where political action by blacks was rare. In\nJohannesburg, one has the support of hundreds and even thousands of others who are engaging in the same dangerous activities, but in a\nconservative place like Kimberley, with no liberal press or judiciary to oversee the police, such an action requires true valor. It was in Kimberley\nduring the Defiance Campaign that one of the ANC\u2019s leading members was sentenced to lashes by the local magistrate.\nDespite my cold, Arthur allowed me to address an ANC meeting in his house the following evening. I was preparing to leave the next morning at\nthree o\u2019clock, but Arthur and his wife insisted I remain for breakfast, which I did. I made good time on the way back to Johannesburg and arrived\nhome just before supper, where I was met with excited cries from my children, who well knew that I was a father bearing gifts. One by one, I handed\nout the presents I had purchased in Cape Town and patiently answered their questions about the trip. Though not a true holiday, it had the same\neffect: I felt rejuvenated and ready to take up the fight once more JUST AFTER DAWN, on the morning of December , , I was awakened by a loud knocking on my door. No neighbor or friend ever knocks in\nsuch a peremptory way, and I knew immediately that it was the security police. I dressed quickly and found Head Constable Rousseau, a security\nofficer who was a familiar figure in our area, and two policemen. He produced a search warrant, at which point the three of them immediately began\nto comb through the entire house looking for incriminating papers or documents. By this time the children were awake, and with a stern look I bade\nthem to be calm. The children looked to me for reassurance. The police searched drawers and cabinets and closets, any place where contraband\nmight have been hidden. After forty-five minutes, Rousseau matter-of-factly said, \u201cMandela, we have a warrant for your arrest. Come with me.\u201d I\nlooked at the warrant, and the words leapt out at me: \u201cHOOGVERRAAD \u2014 HIGH TREASON.\u201d\nI walked with them to the car. It is not pleasant to be arrested in front of one\u2019s children, even though one knows that what one is doing is right. But\nchildren do not comprehend the complexity of the situation; they simply see their father being taken away by the white authorities without an\nexplanation.\nRousseau drove and I sat next to him \u2014 without handcuffs \u2014 in the front seat. He had a search warrant for my office in town, where we were now\nheaded after dropping off the two other policemen in a nearby area. To get to downtown Johannesburg, one had to travel along a desolate highway\nthat cut through an unpopulated area. While we were motoring along this stretch, I remarked to Rousseau that he must be very confident to drive\nwith me alone and unhandcuffed. He was silent.\n\u201cWhat would happen if I seized you and overpowered you?\u201d I said.\nRousseau shifted uncomfortably. \u201cYou are playing with fire, Mandela,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPlaying with fire is my game,\u201d I replied.\n\u201cIf you continue speaking like this I will have to handcuff you,\u201d Rousseau said threateningly.\n\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d\nWe continued this tense debate for a few more minutes, but as we passed into a populated area near the Langlaagte police station, Rousseau\nsaid to me: \u201cMandela, I have treated you well and I expect you to do the same to me. I don\u2019t like your jokes.\u201d\nAfter a brief stop at the police station, we were joined by another officer and went to my office, which they searched for another forty-five minutes.\nFrom there, I was taken to Marshall Square, the rambling red-brick Johannesburg prison where I had spent a few nights in  during the\nDefiance Campaign. A number of my colleagues were already there, having been arrested and booked earlier that morning. Over the next few\nhours, more friends and comrades began to trickle in. This was the swoop the government had long been planning. Someone smuggled in a copy\nof the afternoon edition of The Star, and we learned from its banner headlines that the raid had been countrywide and that the premier leaders of\nthe Congress Alliance were all being arrested on charges of high treason and an alleged conspiracy to overthrow the state. Those who had been\narrested in different parts of the country \u2014 Chief Luthuli, Monty Naicker, Reggie September, Lilian Ngoyi, Piet Beyleveld \u2014 were flown by military\nplanes to Johannesburg, where they were to be arraigned. One hundred forty-four people had been arrested. The next day we appeared in court\nand we were formally charged. A week later, Walter Sisulu and eleven others were arrested, bringing the total to one hundred fifty-six. All told, there\nwere one hundred five Africans, twenty-one Indians, twenty-three whites, and seven Coloureds. Almost the entire executive leadership of the ANC,\nboth banned and unbanned, had been arrested. The government, at long last, had made its move.\n\nWe were soon transferred to the Johannesburg Prison, popularly known as the Fort, a bleak, castle-like structure located on a hill in the heart of the\ncity. Upon admission we were taken to an outdoor quadrangle and ordered to strip completely and line up against the wall. We were forced to\nstand there for more than an hour, shivering in the breeze and feeling awkward \u2014 priests, professors, doctors, lawyers, businessmen, men of\nmiddle or old age, who were normally treated with deference and respect. Despite my anger, I could not suppress a laugh as I scrutinized the men\naround me. For the first time, the truth of the aphorism \u201cclothes make the man\u201d came home to me. If fine bodies and impressive physiques were\nessential to being a leader I saw that few among us would have qualified.\nA white doctor finally appeared and asked whether any of us was ill. No one complained of any ailment. We were ordered to dress, and then\nescorted to two large cells with cement floors and no furniture. The cells had recently been painted and reeked of paint fumes. We were each given\nthree thin blankets plus a sisal mat. Each cell had only one floor-level latrine, which was completely exposed. It is said that no one truly knows a\nnation until one has been inside its jails. A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones \u2014 and South Africa\ntreated its imprisoned African citizens like animals.\n\nWe stayed in the Fort for two weeks, and despite the hardships, our spirits remained extremely high. We were permitted newspapers and read with\ngratification of the waves of indignation aroused by our arrests. Protest meetings and demonstrations were being held throughout South Africa;\npeople carried signs declaring \u201cWe Stand by Our Leaders.\u201d We read of protests around the world over our incarceration.\nOur communal cell became a kind of convention for far-flung freedom fighters. Many of us had been living under severe restrictions, making it\nillegal for us to meet and talk. Now, our enemy had gathered us all together under one roof for what became the largest and longest unbanned\nmeeting of the Congress Alliance in years. Younger leaders met older leaders they had only read about. Men from Natal mingled with leaders from\nthe Transvaal. We reveled in the opportunity to exchange ideas and experiences for two weeks while we awaited trial.\nEach day, we put together a program of activities. Patrick Molaoa and Peter Nthite, both prominent Youth Leaguers, organized physical training.\nTalks on a variety of subjects were scheduled, and we heard Professor Matthews discourse on both the history of the ANC and the American\nNegro, Debi Singh lectured on the history of the SAIC, Arthur Letele discussed the African medicine man, while Reverend James Calata spoke on\nAfrican music \u2014 and sang in his beautiful tenor voice. Every day, Vuyisile Mini, who years later was hanged by the government for political crimes,\nled the group in singing freedom songs. One of the most popular was: \u201cNans\u2019 indod\u2019 emnyama Strijdom, Bhasobha nans\u2019 indod\u2019 emnyama\nStrijdom\u201d (Here\u2019s the black man, Strijdom, beware the black man, Strijdom). We sang at the top of our lungs, and it kept our spirits high.\nOne time, Masabalala Yengwa (better known as M. B. Yengwa), the son of a Zulu laborer and the provincial secretary of the Natal ANC,\ncontributed to a lecture on music by reciting a praise song in honor of Shaka, the legendary Zulu warrior and king. Yengwa draped himself with a\nblanket, rolled up a newspaper to imitate an assegai, and began to stride back and forth reciting the lines from the praise song. All of us, even\nthose who did not understand Zulu, were entranced. Then he paused dramatically and called out the lines \u201cInyon\u2019 edl\u2019 ezinye! Yath\u2019 isadl\u2019 ezinye,\nyadl\u2019 ezinye!\u201d The lines liken Shaka to a great bird of prey that relentlessly slays its enemies. At the conclusion of these words, pandemonium broke\n\n\fout. Chief Luthuli, who until then had remained quiet, sprang to his feet, and bellowed, \u201cNgu Shaka lowo!\u201d (That is Shaka!), and then began to dance\nand chant. His movements electrified us, and we all took to our feet. Accomplished ballroom dancers, sluggards who knew neither traditional nor\nWestern dancing, all joined in the indlamu, the traditional Zulu war dance. Some moved gracefully, others resembled frozen mountaineers trying to\nshake off the cold, but all danced with enthusiasm and emotion. Suddenly there were no Xhosas or Zulus, no Indians or Africans, no rightists or\nleftists, no religious or political leaders; we were all nationalists and patriots bound together by a love of our common history, our culture, our\ncountry, and our people. In that moment, something stirred deep inside all of us, something strong and intimate, that bound us to one another. In that\nmoment we felt the hand of the great past that made us what we were and the power of the great cause that linked us all together.\n\nAfter the two weeks, we appeared for our preparatory examination on December  at the Drill Hall in Johannesburg, a military structure not\nnormally used as a court of justice. It was a great bare barn of a building with a corrugated iron roof and was considered the only public building\nlarge enough to support a trial of so many accused.\nWe were taken in sealed police vans escorted by a half-dozen troop carriers filled with armed soldiers. One would have thought a full-scale civil\nwar was under way from the precautions the state was taking with us. A massive crowd of our supporters was blocking traffic in Twist Street; we\ncould hear them cheering and singing, and they could hear us answering from inside the van. The trip became a triumphal procession as the slowmoving van was rocked by the crowd. The entire perimeter of the hall was surrounded by gun-toting policemen and soldiers. The vans were brought\nto an area behind the hall and parked so that we alighted straight from the van into the courtroom.\nInside, we were met by another crowd of supporters, so that the hall seemed more like a raucous protest meeting than a staid court of law. We\nwalked in with our thumbs raised in the ANC salute and nodded to our supporters sitting in the non-Whites Only section. The mood inside was more\ncelebratory than punitive, as the accused mingled with reporters and friends.\nThe government was charging all one hundred fifty-six of us with high treason and a countrywide conspiracy to use violence to overthrow the\npresent government and replace it with a Communist state. The period covered by the indictment was October , , through December ,\n: it included the Defiance Campaign, the Sophiatown removal, and the Congress of the People. The South African law of high treason was\nbased not on English law, but on Roman Dutch antecedents, and defined high treason as a hostile intention to disturb, impair, or endanger the\nindependence or safety of the state. The punishment was death.\nThe purpose of a preparatory examination was to determine whether the government\u2019s charges were sufficient to put us on trial in the Supreme\nCourt. There were two stages of giving evidence. The first stage took place in a magistrate\u2019s court. If the magistrate determined that there was\nsufficient evidence against the accused, the case would move to the Supreme Court and be tried before a judge. If the magistrate decided there\nwas insufficient evidence, the defendants were discharged.\nThe magistrate was Mr. F. C. Wessel, the chief magistrate from Bloemfontein. That first day, when Wessel began to speak in his quiet voice it\nwas impossible to hear him. The state had neglected to provide microphones and loudspeakers, and the court was adjourned for two hours while\namplification was sought. We assembled in a courtyard and had what was very much like a picnic, with food sent in from the outside. The\natmosphere was almost festive. Two hours later, court was recessed for the day because proper loudspeakers had not been found. To the cheers\nof the crowd, we were once again escorted back to the Fort.\nThe next day, the crowds outside were even larger, the police more tense. Five hundred armed police surrounded the Drill Hall. When we arrived,\nwe discovered that the state had erected an enormous wire cage for us to sit in. It was made of diamond-mesh wire, attached to poles and\nscaffolding with a grille at the front and top. We were led inside and sat on benches, surrounded by sixteen armed guards.\nIn addition to its symbolic effect, the cage cut us off from communication with our lawyers, who were not permitted to enter. One of my colleagues\nscribbled on a piece of paper, which he then posted on the side of the cage: \u201cDangerous. Please Do Not Feed.\u201d\nOur supporters and organization had assembled a formidable defense team, including Bram Fischer, Norman Rosenberg, Israel Maisels,\nMaurice Franks, and Vernon Berrang\u00e9. None of them had ever seen such a structure in court before. Franks lodged a powerful protest in open\ncourt against the state\u2019s humiliating his clients in such a \u201cfantastic\u201d fashion and treating them, he said, \u201clike wild beasts.\u201d Unless the cage was\nremoved forthwith, he announced, the entire defense team would walk out of court. After a brief adjournment, the magistrate decided that the cage\nwould be pulled down; in the meantime, the front of it was removed.\nOnly then did the state begin its case. The chief prosecutor, Mr. Van Niekerk, began reading part of an ,-word address outlining the Crown\ncase against us. Even with amplification he was barely audible against the shouting and singing outside, and at one point a group of policemen\nrushed out. We heard a revolver shot, followed by shouts and more gunfire. The court was adjourned while the magistrate held a meeting with\ncounsel. Twenty people had been injured.\nThe reading of the charges continued for the next two days. Van Niekerk said that he would prove to the court that the accused, with help from\nother countries, were plotting to overthrow the existing government by violence and impose a Communist government on South Africa. This was the\ncharge of high treason. The state cited the Freedom Charter as both proof of our Communist intentions and evidence of our plot to overthrow the\nexisting authorities. By the third day, much of the cage had been dismantled. Finally, on the fourth day, we were released on bail. Bail was another\nexample of the sliding scale of apartheid: \u00a3 for whites; \u00a3 for Indians; and \u00a3 for Africans and Coloureds. Even treason was not colorblind.\nWell-wishers from diverse walks of life came forward to guarantee bail for each of the accused, gestures of support that later became the\nfoundation for the Treason Trial Defense Fund started by Bishop Reeves, Alan Paton, and Alex Hepple. The fund was ably administered during the\ntrial by Mary Benson and then Freda Levson. We were released provided we reported once a week to the police, and were forbidden from\nattending public gatherings. Court was to resume in early January.\nThe following day I was at my office bright and early. Oliver and I had both been in prison, and our caseload had mounted in the meantime. While\ntrying to work that morning, I was visited by an old friend named Jabavu, a professional interpreter whom I had not seen for several months. Before\nthe arrests I had deliberately cut down my weight, in anticipation of prison, where one should be lean and able to survive on little. In jail, I had\ncontinued my exercises, and was pleased to be so trim. But Jabavu eyed me suspiciously. \u201cMadiba,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy must you look so thin?\u201d In\nAfrican cultures, portliness is often associated with wealth and well-being. He burst out: \u201cMan, you were scared of jail, that is all. You have disgraced\nus, we Xhosas!\u201d MY TIME UNDERGROUND was mainly taken up in planning the May  stay-at-home. It was shaping up to be a virtual war between the state and\nthe liberation movement. Late in May, the government staged countrywide raids on opposition leaders. Meetings were banned; printing presses\nwere seized; and legislation was rushed through Parliament permitting the police to detain charged prisoners for twelve days without bail.\nVerwoerd declared that those supporting the strike, including sympathetic newspapers, were \u201cplaying with fire,\u201d an ominous declaration given the\nruthlessness of the state. The government urged industries to provide sleeping accommodations for workers so that they would not have to return\nhome during the strike. Two days before the stay-at-home, the government staged the greatest peace-time show of force in South African history.\nThe military exercised its largest call-up since the war. Police holidays were canceled. Military units were stationed at the entrances and exits of\ntownships. While Saracen tanks rumbled through the dirt streets of the townships, helicopters hovered above, swooping down to break up any\ngathering. At night, the helicopters trained searchlights on houses.\nThe English-language press had widely publicized the campaign until a few days before it was to begin. But on the eve of the stay-at-home the\nentire English-language press crumbled and urged people to go to work. The PAC played the role of saboteur and released thousands of flyers\ntelling people to oppose the stay-at-home, and denouncing the ANC leaders as cowards. The PAC\u2019s actions shocked us. It is one thing to criticize,\nand that we can accept, but to attempt to break a strike by calling upon the people to go to work directly serves the interests of the enemy.\n\nThe night before the stay-at-home, I was scheduled to meet the Johannesburg leadership of the ANC at a safe house in Soweto. To avoid police\nroadblocks, I entered Soweto through Kliptown, which was normally not patrolled. But as I went around a blind corner I drove straight into what I had\nbeen trying to avoid: a roadblock. A white policeman motioned for me to stop. I was dressed in my usual costume of overalls and chauffeur\u2019s cap.\nHe squinted through the window at me and then stepped forward and searched the car on his own. Normally, this was the duty of the African police.\nAfter he found nothing, he demanded my pass. I told him that I had left it at home by mistake, and casually recited a fictitious pass number. This\nseemed to satisfy him and he motioned for me to drive through.\nOn Monday, May , the first day of the stay-at-home, hundreds of thousands of people risked their jobs and livelihoods by not going to work. In\nDurban, Indian workers walked out of factories while in the Cape thousands of Coloured workers stayed home. In Johannesburg, more than half of\nemployees stayed home and in Port Elizabeth the rate was even higher. I praised the response as \u201cmagnificent\u201d to the press, lauding our people for\n\u201cdefying unprecedented intimidation by the state.\u201d The white celebration of Republic Day was drowned out by our protest.\nAlthough reports on the first day of the stay-at-home suggested strong reactions in various parts of the country, the response as a whole\nappeared less than we had hoped. Communication was difficult, and bad news always seems to travel more efficiently than good news. As more\nreports came in, I felt let down and disappointed by the reaction. That evening, feeling demoralized and a bit angry, I had a conversation with\nBenjamin Pogrund of the Rand Daily Mail in which I suggested that the days of nonviolent struggle were over.\nOn the second day of the stay-at-home, after consultations with my colleagues, I called it off. I met that morning in a safe flat in a white suburb with\nvarious members of the local and foreign press, and I once again called the stay-at-home \u201ca tremendous success.\u201d But I did not mask the fact that I\nbelieved a new day was dawning. I said, \u201cIf the government reaction is to crush by naked force our nonviolent struggle, we will have to reconsider\nour tactics. In my mind we are closing a chapter on this question of a nonviolent policy.\u201d It was a grave declaration, and I knew it. I was criticized by\nour executive for making that remark before it was discussed by the organization, but sometimes one must go public with an idea to push a\nreluctant organization in the direction you want it to go.\nThe debate on the use of violence had been going on among us since early . I had first discussed the armed struggle as far back as \nwith Walter. Now, I again conferred with him and we agreed that the organization had to set out on a new course. The Communist Party had secretly\nreconstituted itself underground and was now considering forming its own military wing. We decided that I should raise the issue of the armed\nstruggle within the Working Committee, and I did so in a meeting in June of .\nI had barely commenced my proposal when Moses Kotane, the secretary of the Communist Party and one of the most powerful figures in the\nANC executive, staged a counterassault, accusing me of not having thought out the proposal carefully enough. He said that I had been\noutmaneuvered and paralyzed by the government\u2019s actions, and now in desperation I was resorting to revolutionary language. \u201cThere is still room,\u201d\nhe stressed, \u201cfor the old methods if we are imaginative and determined enough. If we embark on the course Mandela is suggesting, we will be\nexposing innocent people to massacres by the enemy.\u201d\nMoses spoke persuasively and I could see that he had defeated my proposal. Even Walter did not speak on my behalf, and I backed down.\nAfterward I spoke with Walter and voiced my frustration, chiding him for not coming to my aid. He laughed and said it would have been as foolish as\nattempting to fight a pride of angry lions. Walter is a diplomat and extremely resourceful. \u201cLet me arrange for Moses to come and see you privately,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cand you can make your case that way.\u201d I was underground, but Walter managed to put the two of us together in a house in the township\nand we spent the whole day talking.\nI was candid and explained why I believed we had no choice but to turn to violence. I used an old African expression: Sebatana ha se bokwe ka\ndiatla (The attacks of the wild beast cannot be averted with only bare hands). Moses was an old-line Communist, and I told him that his opposition\nwas like the Communist Party in Cuba under Batista. The party had insisted that the appropriate conditions had not yet arrived, and waited\nbecause they were simply following the textbook definitions of Lenin and Stalin. Castro did not wait, he acted \u2014 and he triumphed. If you wait for\ntextbook conditions, they will never occur. I told Moses point-blank that his mind was stuck in the old mold of the ANC\u2019s being a legal organization.\nPeople were already forming military units on their own, and the only organization that had the muscle to lead them was the ANC. We have always\nmaintained that the people were ahead of us, and now they were.\nWe talked the entire day, and at the end, Moses said to me, \u201cNelson, I will not promise you anything, but raise the issue again in committee, and\nwe will see what happens.\u201d A meeting was scheduled in a week\u2019s time, and once again I raised the issue. This time, Moses was silent, and the\ngeneral consensus of the meeting was that I should make the proposal to the National Executive Committee in Durban. Walter simply smiled.\nThe executive meeting in Durban, like all ANC meetings at the time, was held in secret and at night in order to avoid the police. I suspected I\nwould encounter difficulties because Chief Luthuli was to be in attendance and I knew of his moral commitment to nonviolence. I was also wary\nbecause of the timing: I was raising the issue of violence so soon after the Treason Trial, where we had contended that for the ANC nonviolence\nwas an inviolate principle, not a tactic to be changed as conditions warranted. I myself believed precisely the opposite: that nonviolence was a\ntactic that should be abandoned when it no longer worked.\nAt the meeting I argued that the state had given us no alternative to violence. I said it was wrong and immoral to subject our people to armed\nattacks by the state without offering them some kind of alternative. I mentioned again that people on their own had taken up arms. Violence would\n\n\fbegin whether we initiated it or not. Would it not be better to guide this violence ourselves, according to principles where we save lives by attacking\nsymbols of oppression, and not people? If we did not take the lead now, I said, we would soon be latecomers and followers to a movement we did\nnot control.\nThe chief initially resisted my arguments. For him, nonviolence was not simply a tactic. But we worked on him the whole night; and I think that in\nhis heart he realized that we were right. He ultimately agreed that a military campaign was inevitable. When someone later insinuated that perhaps\nthe chief was not prepared for such a course, he retorted, \u201cIf anyone thinks I\u2019m a pacifist, let him try to take my chickens, and he will know how wrong\nhe is!\u201d\nThe National Executive formally endorsed the preliminary decision of the Working Committee. The chief and others suggested that we should\ntreat this new resolution as if the ANC had not discussed it. He did not want to jeopardize the legality of our unbanned allies. His idea was that a\nmilitary movement should be a separate and independent organ, linked to the ANC and under the overall control of the ANC, but fundamentally\nautonomous. There would be two separate streams of the struggle. We readily accepted the chief\u2019s suggestion. The chief and others warned\nagainst this new phase becoming an excuse for neglecting the essential tasks of organization and the traditional methods of struggle. That, too,\nwould be self-defeating because the armed struggle, at least in the beginning, would not be the centerpiece of the movement.\nThe following night a meeting of the joint executives was scheduled in Durban. This would include the Indian Congress, the Colored People\u2019s\nCongress, the South African Congress of Trade Unions, and the Congress of Democrats. Although these other groups customarily accepted ANC\ndecisions, I knew that some of my Indian colleagues would strenuously oppose the move toward violence.\nThe meeting had an inauspicious beginning. Chief Luthuli, who was presiding, announced that even though the ANC had endorsed a decision on\nviolence, \u201cit is a matter of such gravity, I would like my colleagues here tonight to consider the issue afresh.\u201d It was apparent that the chief was not\nfully reconciled to our new course.\nWe began our session at  P.M. and it was tumultuous. I made the identical arguments that I had been making all along, and many people\nexpressed reservations. Yusuf Cachalia and Dr. Naicker pleaded with us not to embark on this course, arguing that the state would slaughter the\nwhole liberation movement. J. N. Singh, an effective debater, uttered words that night which still echo in my head. \u201cNonviolence has not failed us,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cwe have failed nonviolence.\u201d I countered by saying that in fact nonviolence had failed us, for it had done nothing to stem the violence of the\nstate nor change the heart of our oppressors.\nWe argued the entire night, and in the early hours of the morning I began to feel we were making progress. Many of the Indian leaders were now\nspeaking in a sorrowful tone about the end of nonviolence. But then suddenly M. D. Naidoo, a member of the South African Indian Congress, burst\nforth and said to his Indian colleagues, \u201cAh, you are afraid of going to jail, that is all!\u201d His comment caused pandemonium in the meeting. When you\nquestion a man\u2019s integrity, you can expect a fight. The entire debate went back to square one. But toward dawn, there was a resolution. The\ncongresses authorized me to go ahead and form a new military organization, separate from the ANC. The policy of the ANC would still be that of\nnonviolence. I was authorized to join with whomever I wanted or needed to create this organization and would not be subject to the direct control of\nthe mother organization.\nThis was a fateful step. For fifty years, the ANC had treated nonviolence as a core principle, beyond question or debate. Henceforth, the ANC\nwould be a different kind of organization. We were embarking on a new and more dangerous path, a path of organized violence, the results of\nwhich we did not and could not know. MY NEXT ADDRESS was more of a sanctuary than a hideout: Liliesleaf Farm, located in Rivonia, a bucolic northern suburb of Johannesburg, and I\nmoved there in October. In those days Rivonia consisted mainly of farms and smallholdings. The farmhouse and property had been purchased by\nthe movement for the purpose of having a safe house for those underground. It was an old house that needed work and no one lived there.\nI moved in under the pretext that I was the houseboy or caretaker who would look after the place until my master took possession. I had taken the\nalias David Motsamayi, the name of one of my former clients. At the farm, I wore the simple blue overalls that were the uniform of the black male\nservant. During the day, the place was busy with workers, builders, and painters who were repairing the main house and extending the outbuildings.\nWe wanted to have a number of small rooms added to the house so more people could stay. The workers were all Africans from Alexandra\ntownship and they called me \u201cwaiter\u201d or \u201cboy\u201d (they never bothered to ask my name). I prepared breakfast for them and made them tea in the late\nmorning and afternoon. They also sent me on errands about the farm, or ordered me to sweep the floor or pick up trash.\nOne afternoon, I informed them that I had prepared tea in the kitchen. They came in and I passed around a tray with cups, tea, milk and sugar.\nEach man took a cup, and helped himself. As I was carrying the tray I came to one fellow who was in the middle of telling a story. He took a cup of\ntea, but he was concentrating more on his story than on me, and he simply held his teaspoon in the air while he was talking, using it to gesture and\ntell his tale rather than help himself to some sugar. I stood there for what seemed like several minutes and finally, in mild exasperation, I started to\nmove away. At that point he noticed me, and said sharply, \u201cWaiter, come back here, I didn\u2019t say you could leave.\u201d\nMany people have painted an idealistic picture of the egalitarian nature of African society, and while in general I agree with this portrait, the fact is\nthat Africans do not always treat each other as equals. Industrialization has played a large role in introducing the urban African to the perceptions of\nstatus common to white society. To those men, I was an inferior, a servant, a person without a trade, and therefore to be treated with disdain. I\nplayed the role so well that none of them suspected I was anything other than what I seemed.\nEvery day, at sunset, the workers would return to their homes and I would be alone until the next morning. I relished these hours of quiet, but on\nmost evenings I would leave the property to attend meetings, returning in the middle of the night. I often felt uneasy coming back at such hours to a\nplace I did not know well and where I was living illegally under an assumed name. I recall being frightened one night when I thought I saw someone\nlurking in the bushes; although I investigated, I found nothing. An underground freedom fighter sleeps very lightly.\nAfter a number of weeks I was joined at the farm by Raymond Mhlaba, who had journeyed up from Port Elizabeth. Ray was a staunch trade\nunionist, a member of the Cape executive and the Communist Party, and the first ANC leader to be arrested in the Defiance Campaign. He had\nbeen chosen by the ANC to be one of the first recruits for Umkhonto we Sizwe. He had come to prepare for his departure, with three others, for\nmilitary training in the People\u2019s Republic of China; we had renewed the contacts that Walter had made back in . Ray stayed with me for a\nfortnight and provided me with a clearer picture of the problems the ANC was having in the eastern Cape. I also enlisted his assistance in writing\nthe MK constitution. We were joined by Joe Slovo as well as Rusty Bernstein, who both had hands in drafting it.\nAfter Raymond left, I was joined for a brief time by Michael Harmel, a key figure in the underground Communist Party, a founding member of the\nCongress of Democrats, and an editor of the magazine Liberation. Michael was a brilliant theorist and was working on policy matters for the\nCommunist Party and needed a quiet and safe place to work on this full-time.\nDuring the day, I kept my distance from Michael as it would have seemed exceedingly curious if a white professional man and an African\nhouseboy were having regular conversations. But at night, after the workers left, we had long conversations about the relationship between the\nCommunist Party and the ANC. One night I returned to the farm late after a meeting. When I was there alone, I made sure that all the gates were\nlocked and the lights were out. I took quite a few precautions because a black man driving a car into a smallholding in Rivonia in the middle of the\nnight would attract unwanted questions. But I saw that the house lights were on, and as I approached the house I heard a radio blaring. The front\ndoor was open and I walked in and found Michael in bed fast asleep. I was furious at this breach of security, and I woke him up and said, \u201cMan, how\ncan you leave the lights on and the radio playing!\u201d He was groggy but angry. \u201cNel, must you disturb my sleep? Can\u2019t this wait until tomorrow?\u201d I said\nit couldn\u2019t, it was a matter of security, and I reprimanded him for his lax conduct.\nSoon after this Arthur Goldreich and his family moved into the main house as official tenants and I took over the newly built domestic workers\u2019\ncottage. Arthur\u2019s presence provided a safe cover for our activities. Arthur was an artist and designer by profession, a member of the Congress of\nDemocrats and one of the first members of MK. His politics were unknown to the police and he had never before been questioned or raided. In the\ns, Arthur had fought with the Palmach, the military wing of the Jewish National Movement in Palestine. He was knowledgeable about guerrilla\nwarfare and helped fill many gaps in my knowledge. Arthur was a flamboyant person and he gave the farm a buoyant atmosphere.\nThe final addition to the regular group at the farm was Mr. Jelliman, an amiable white pensioner and old friend of the movement who became the\nfarm foreman. Mr. Jelliman brought in several young workers from Sekhukhuneland, and the place soon appeared to be like any other smallholding\nin the country. Jelliman was not a member of the ANC, but he was loyal, discreet, and hardworking. I used to prepare breakfast for him as well as\nsupper, and he was unfailingly gracious. Much later, Jelliman risked his own life and livelihood in a courageous attempt to help me.\n\nThe loveliest times at the farm were when I was visited by my wife and family. Once the Goldreichs were in residence, Winnie would visit me on\nweekends. We were careful about her movements, and she would be picked up by one driver, dropped off at another place, and then picked up by\na second driver before finally being delivered to the farm. Later, she would drive herself and the children, taking the most circuitous route possible.\nThe police were not yet following her every move.\nOn these weekends time would sometimes seem to stop as we pretended that these stolen moments together were the rule not the exception of\nour lives. Ironically, we had more privacy at Liliesleaf than we ever had at home. The children could run about and play, and we were secure,\nhowever briefly, in this idyllic bubble.\nWinnie brought me an old air rifle that I had in Orlando and Arthur and I would use it for target practice or hunting doves on the farm. One day, I\nwas on the front lawn of the property and aimed the gun at a sparrow perched high in a tree. Hazel Goldreich, Arthur\u2019s wife, was watching me and\njokingly remarked that I would never hit my target. But she had hardly finished the sentence when the sparrow fell to the ground. I turned to her and\nwas about to boast, when the Goldreichs\u2019 son Paul, then about five years old, turned to me with tears in his eyes and said, \u201cDavid, why did you kill\nthat bird? Its mother will be sad.\u201d My mood immediately shifted from one of pride to shame; I felt that this small boy had far more humanity than I did.\nIt was an odd sensation for a man who was the leader of a nascent guerrilla army.\n IN PLANNING the direction and form that MK would take, we considered four types of violent activities: sabotage, guerrilla warfare, terrorism, and\nopen revolution. For a small and fledgling army, open revolution was inconceivable. Terrorism inevitably reflected poorly on those who used it,\nundermining any public support it might otherwise garner. Guerrilla warfare was a possibility, but since the ANC had been reluctant to embrace\nviolence at all, it made sense to start with the form of violence that inflicted the least harm against individuals: sabotage.\nBecause it did not involve loss of life it offered the best hope for reconciliation among the races afterward. We did not want to start a blood feud\nbetween white and black. Animosity between Afrikaner and Englishman was still sharp fifty years after the Anglo-Boer War; what would race\nrelations be like between white and black if we provoked a civil war? Sabotage had the added virtue of requiring the least manpower.\nOur strategy was to make selective forays against military installations, power plants, telephone lines, and transportation links; targets that would\nnot only hamper the military effectiveness of the state, but frighten National Party supporters, scare away foreign capital, and weaken the economy.\nThis we hoped would bring the government to the bargaining table. Strict instructions were given to members of MK that we would countenance no\nloss of life. But if sabotage did not produce the results we wanted, we were prepared to move on to the next stage: guerrilla warfare and terrorism.\nThe structure of MK mirrored that of the parent organization. The National High Command was at the top; below it were Regional Commands in\neach of the provinces, and below that there were local commands and cells. Regional Commands were set up around the country, and an area like\nthe eastern Cape had over fifty cells. The High Command determined tactics and general targets and was in charge of training and finance. Within\nthe framework laid down by the High Command, the Regional Commands had authority to select local targets to be attacked. All MK members\nwere forbidden to go armed into an operation and were not to endanger life in any way.\nOne problem we encountered early on was the question of divided loyalties between MK and the ANC. Most of our recruits were ANC members\nwho were active in the local branches, but we found that once they were working for MK, they stopped doing the local work they had been\nperforming before. The secretary of the local branch would find that certain men were no longer attending meetings. He might approach one and\nsay, \u201cMan, why were you not at the meeting last night?\u201d and the fellow would say, \u201cAh, well, I was at another meeting.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of meeting?\u201d the secretary would say.\n\u201cOh, I cannot say.\u201d\n\u201cYou cannot tell me, your own secretary?\u201d But the secretary would soon discover the member\u2019s other loyalty. After some initial\nmisunderstandings, we decided that if we recruited members from a branch, the secretary must be informed that one of his members was now with\nMK.\n\nOne warm December afternoon, while I sat in the kitchen at Liliesleaf Farm, I listened on the radio to the announcement that Chief Luthuli had been\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo. The government had issued him a ten-day visa to leave the country and accept the award. I\nwas \u2014 we all were \u2014 enormously pleased. It was, first of all, an acknowledgment of our struggle, and of the achievements of the chief as the leader\nof that struggle and as a man. It represented a recognition in the West that our struggle was a moral one, one too long ignored by the great powers.\nThe award was an affront to the Nationalists, whose propaganda portrayed Luthuli as a dangerous agitator at the head of a Communist conspiracy.\nAfrikaners were dumbfounded; to them the award was another example of the perversity of Western liberals and their bias against white South\nAfricans. When the award was announced, the chief was in the third year of a five-year ban restricting him to the district of Stanger in Natal. He was\nalso unwell; his heart was strained and his memory was poor. But the award cheered him and all of us as well.\nThe honor came at an awkward time for it was juxtaposed against an announcement that seemed to call the award itself into question. The day\nafter Luthuli returned from Oslo, MK dramatically announced its emergence. On the orders of the MK High Command, in the early morning hours of\nDecember  \u2014 the day white South Africans used to celebrate as Dingane\u2019s Day \u2014 homemade bombs were exploded at electric power stations\nand government offices in Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth, and Durban. One of our men, Petrus Molife, was inadvertently killed, the first death of an\nMK soldier. Death in war is unfortunate, but unavoidable. Every man who joined MK knew that he might be called on to pay the ultimate sacrifice.\nAt the time of the explosions, thousands of leaflets with the new MK Manifesto were circulated all over the country announcing the birth of\nUmkhonto we Sizwe.\nUnits of Umkhonto we Sizwe today carried out planned attacks against government installations, particularly those connected with the policy of apartheid and race discrimination.\nUmkhonto we Sizwe is a new, independent body, formed by Africans. It includes in its ranks South Africans of all races. . . . Umkhonto we Sizwe will carry on the struggle for\nfreedom and democracy by new methods, which are necessary to complement the actions of the established national liberation movement. . . .\nThe time comes in the life of any nation when there remain only two choices: submit or fight. That time has now come to South Africa. We shall not submit and we have no\nchoice but to hit back by all means within our power in defence of our people, our future and our freedom. . . .\nWe of Umkhonto have always sought \u2014 as the liberation movement has sought \u2014 to achieve liberation without bloodshed and civil clash. We hope, even at this late hour, that\nour first actions will awaken everyone to a realization of the disastrous situation to which the Nationalist policy is leading. We hope that we will bring the government and its\nsupporters to their senses before it is too late, so that both the government and its policies can be changed before matters reach the desperate stage of civil war. . . .\n\nWe chose December , Dingane\u2019s Day, for a reason. On that day, white South Africans celebrate the defeat of the great Zulu leader Dingane at\nthe Battle of Blood River in . Dingane, the half brother of Shaka, then ruled the most powerful African state that ever existed south of the\nLimpopo River. That day, the bullets of the Boers were too much for the assegais of the Zulu impis and the water of the nearby river ran red with\ntheir blood. Afrikaners celebrate December  as the triumph of the Afrikaner over the African and the demonstration that God was on their side;\nwhile Africans mourned this day of the massacre of their people. We chose December  to show that the African had only begun to fight, and that\nwe had righteousness \u2014 and dynamite \u2014 on our side.\nThe explosions took the government by surprise. They condemned the sabotage as heinous crimes while at the same time deriding it as the\nwork of foolish amateurs. The explosions also shocked white South Africans into the realization that they were sitting on top of a volcano. Black\nSouth Africans realized that the ANC was no longer an organization of passive resistance, but a powerful spear that would take the struggle to the\nheart of white power. We planned and executed another set of explosions two weeks later on New Year\u2019s Eve. The combined sound of bells tolling\nand sirens wailing seemed not just a cacophonous way to ring in the new year, but a sound that symbolized a new era in our freedom struggle.\nThe announcement of Umkhonto spurred a vicious and unrelenting government counteroffensive on a scale that we had never before seen. The\nSpecial Branch of the police now made it their number one mission to capture members of MK, and they would spare no effort to do so. We had\nshown them we were not going to sit back any longer; they would show us that nothing would stop them from rooting out what they saw as the\ngreatest threat to their own survival. MY LIFE, during the Defiance Campaign, ran on two separate tracks: my work in the struggle and my livelihood as an attorney. I was never a fulltime organizer for the ANC; the organization had only one, and that was Thomas Titus Nkobi. The work I did had to be arranged around my\nschedule as an attorney. In , after I had completed my articles at Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, I went to work for the law firm of Terblanche &\nBriggish. When I completed my articles, I was not yet a fully-fledged attorney, but I was in a position to draw court pleadings, send out summonses,\ninterview witnesses \u2014 all of which an attorney must do before a case goes to court.\nAfter leaving Sidelsky, I had investigated a number of white firms \u2014 there were, of course, no African law firms. I was particularly interested in the\nscale of fees charged by these firms and was outraged to discover that many of the most blue-chip law firms charged Africans even higher fees for\ncriminal and civil cases than they did their far wealthier white clients.\nAfter working for Terblanche & Briggish for about one year, I joined the firm of Helman and Michel. It was a liberal firm and one of the few that\ncharged Africans on a reasonable scale. In addition, the firm prided itself on its devotion to African education, toward which they donated\nhandsomely. Mr. Helman, the firm\u2019s senior partner, was involved with African causes long before they became popular or fashionable. The firm\u2019s\nother partner, Rodney Michel, a veteran of World War II, was also extremely liberal. He was a pilot, and years later helped fly ANC people out of\nSouth Africa during the worst periods of repression. Michel\u2019s only discernible vice was that he was a heavy smoker who puffed on one cigarette\nafter another all day long at the office.\nI stayed at Helman and Michel for a number of months while I was studying for my qualification exam, which would establish me as a fully-fledged\nattorney. I had given up studying for an LL.B. degree at the University of the Witwatersrand after failing my exams several times. I opted to take the\nqualifying exam so that I could practice and begin to earn enough money to support my family. At the time, my sister was living with us, and my\nmother had come to visit, and Evelyn\u2019s wages as a nurse trainee plus my own paltry income were not enough to keep everyone warm and fed.\nWhen I passed the qualification exam, I went to work as a fully-fledged attorney at the firm of H. M. Basner. Basner had been an African\nRepresentative in the Senate, an early member of the Communist Party, and a passionate supporter of African rights. As a lawyer, he was a\ndefender of African leaders and trade unionists. For the months that I worked there, I was often in court representing the firm\u2019s many African clients.\nMr. Basner was an excellent boss and as long as I got my work done at the firm he encouraged my political work. After the experience I gained\nthere, I felt ready to go off on my own.\nIn August of , I opened my own law office. What early success I enjoyed I owed to Zubeida Patel, my secretary. I had met her when she had\ngone to work at H. M. Basner as a replacement for an Afrikaans-speaking secretary, Miss Koch, who had refused to take my dictation. Zubeida\nwas the wife of my friend Cassim Patel, a member of the Indian Congress, and she was without any sense of color bar whatsoever. She had a wide\ncircle of friends, knew many people in the legal world, and when I went out on my own, she agreed to work for me. She brought a great deal of\nbusiness through the door.\nOliver Tambo was then working for a firm called Kovalsky and Tuch. I often visited him there during his lunch hour, and made a point of sitting in a\nWhites Only chair in the Whites Only waiting room. Oliver and I were very good friends, and we mainly discussed ANC business during those lunch\nhours. He had first impressed me at Fort Hare, where I noticed his thoughtful intelligence and sharp debating skills. With his cool, logical style he\ncould demolish an opponent\u2019s argument \u2014 precisely the sort of intelligence that is useful in a courtroom. Before Fort Hare, he had been a brilliant\nstudent at St. Peter\u2019s in Johannesburg. His even-tempered objectivity was an antidote to my more emotional reactions to issues. Oliver was deeply\nreligious and had for a long time considered the ministry to be his calling. He was also a neighbor: he came from Bizana in Pondoland, part of the\nTranskei, and his face bore the distinctive scars of his tribe. It seemed natural for us to practice together and I asked him to join me. A few months\nlater, when Oliver was able to extricate himself from his firm, we opened our own office in downtown Johannesburg.\n\n\u201cMandela and Tambo\u201d read the brass plate on our office door in Chancellor House, a small building just across the street from the marble statues of\nJustice standing in front of the Magistrate\u2019s Court in central Johannesburg. Our building, owned by Indians, was one of the few places where\nAfricans could rent offices in the city. From the beginning, Mandela and Tambo was besieged with clients. We were not the only African lawyers in\nSouth Africa, but we were the only firm of African lawyers. For Africans, we were the firm of first choice and last resort. To reach our offices each\nmorning, we had to move through a crowd of people in the hallways, on the stairs, and in our small waiting room.\nAfricans were desperate for legal help in government buildings: it was a crime to walk through a Whites Only door, a crime to ride a Whites Only\nbus, a crime to use a Whites Only drinking fountain, a crime to walk on a Whites Only beach, a crime to be on the streets past eleven, a crime not to\nhave a pass book and a crime to have the wrong signature in that book, a crime to be unemployed and a crime to be employed in the wrong place,\na crime to live in certain places and a crime to have no place to live.\nEvery week we interviewed old men from the countryside who told us that generation after generation of their family had worked a scraggly piece\nof land from which they were now being evicted. Every week we interviewed old women who brewed African beer as a way to supplement their tiny\nincomes, who now faced jail terms and fines they could not afford to pay. Every week we interviewed people who had lived in the same house for\ndecades only to find that it was now declared a white area and they had to leave without any recompense at all. Every day we heard and saw the\nthousands of humiliations that ordinary Africans confronted every day of their lives.\n\nOliver had a prodigious capacity for work. He spent a great deal of time with each client, not so much for professional reasons but because he was\na man of limitless compassion and patience. He became involved in his clients\u2019 cases and in their lives. He was touched by the plight of the\nmasses as a whole and by each and every individual.\nI realized quickly what Mandela and Tambo meant to ordinary Africans. It was a place where they could come and find a sympathetic ear and a\ncompetent ally, a place where they would not be either turned away or cheated, a place where they might actually feel proud to be represented by\nmen of their own skin color. This was the reason I had become a lawyer in the first place, and my work often made me feel I had made the right\ndecision.\nWe often dealt with a half-dozen cases in a morning, and were in and out of court all day long. In some courts we were treated with courtesy; in\nothers we were treated with contempt. But even as we practiced and fought and won cases, we always knew that no matter how well we pursued\nour careers as attorneys, we could never become a prosecutor, a magistrate, a judge. Although we were dealing with officials whose competence\nwas no greater than our own, their authority was founded on and protected by the color of their skin.\nWe frequently encountered prejudice in the court itself. White witnesses often refused to answer questions from a black attorney. Instead of citing\n\n\fthem for contempt of court, the magistrate would then pose the questions they would not answer from me. I routinely put policemen on the stand and\ninterrogated them; though I would catch them in discrepancies and lies, they never considered me anything but a \u201ckaffir lawyer.\u201d\nI recall once being asked at the outset of a trial to identify myself. This was customary. I said, \u201cI am Nelson Mandela and I appear for the\naccused.\u201d The magistrate said, \u201cI don\u2019t know you. Where is your certificate?\u201d A certificate is the fancy diploma that one frames and hangs on the\nwall; it is not something that an attorney ever carries with him. It would be like asking a man for his university degree. I requested that the magistrate\nbegin the case, and I would bring in my certificate in due course. But the magistrate refused to hear the case, even going so far as to ask a court\nofficer to evict me.\nThis was a clear violation of court practice. The matter eventually came before the Supreme Court and my friend George Bizos, an advocate,\nappeared on my behalf. At the hearing, the presiding judge criticized the conduct of the magistrate and ordered that a different magistrate must\nhear the case.\nBeing a lawyer did not guarantee respect out of court either. One day, near our office, I saw an elderly white woman whose motorcar was\nsandwiched between two cars. I immediately went over and pushed the car, which helped free it. The English-speaking woman turned to me and\nsaid, \u201cThank you, John\u201d \u2014 John being the name whites used to address any African whose name they did not know. She then handed me a\nsixpence coin, which I politely refused. She pushed it toward me, and again I said no thank you. She then exclaimed, \u201cYou refuse a sixpence. You\nmust want a shilling, but you shall not have it!\u201d and then threw the coin at me, and drove off.\nWithin a year, Oliver and I discovered that under the Urban Areas Act we were not permitted to occupy business premises in the city without\nministerial consent. Our request was denied, and we received instead a temporary permit, under the Group Areas Act, which soon expired. The\nauthorities refused to renew it, insisting that we move our offices to an African location many miles away and virtually unreachable for our clients.\nWe interpreted this as an effort by the authorities to put us out of business, and occupied our premises illegally, with threats of eviction constantly\nhanging over our heads.\nWorking as a lawyer in South Africa meant operating under a debased system of justice, a code of law that did not enshrine equality but its\nopposite. One of the most pernicious examples of this is the Population Registration Act, which defined that inequality. I once handled the case of a\nColoured man who was inadvertently classified as an African. He had fought for South Africa during World War II in North Africa and Italy, but after\nhis return, a white bureaucrat had reclassified him as African. This was the type of case, not at all untypical in South Africa, that offered a moral\njigsaw puzzle. I did not support or recognize the principles in the Population Registration Act, but my client needed representation, and he had been\nclassified as something he was not. There were many practical advantages to being classified as Coloured rather than African, such as the fact\nthat Coloured men were not required to carry passes.\nOn his behalf, I appealed to the Classification Board, which adjudicated cases falling under the Population Registration Act. The board consisted\nof a magistrate and two other officials, all white. I had formidable documentary evidence to establish my client\u2019s case and the prosecutor formally\nindicated that he would not oppose our appeal. But the magistrate seemed uninterested in both my evidence and the prosecutor\u2019s demurral. He\nstared at my client and gruffly asked him to turn around so that his back faced the bench. After scrutinizing my client\u2019s shoulders, which sloped down\nsharply, he nodded to the other officials and upheld the appeal. In the view of the white authorities those days, sloping shoulders were one\nstereotype of the Coloured physique. And so it came about that the course of this man\u2019s life was decided purely on a magistrate\u2019s opinion about\nthe structure of his shoulders.\nWe tried many cases involving police brutality, though our success rate was quite low. Police assaults were always difficult to prove. The police\nwere clever enough to detain a prisoner long enough for the wounds and bruises to heal, and often it was simply the word of a policeman against\nour client. The magistrates naturally sided with the police. The coroner\u2019s verdict on a death in police custody would often read, \u201cDeath due to\nmultiple causes,\u201d or some vague explanation that let the police off the hook.\nWhenever I had a case outside Johannesburg, I applied to have my bans temporarily lifted, and this was often granted. For example, I traveled to\nthe eastern Transvaal, and defended a client in the town of Carolina. My arrival caused quite a sensation, as many of the people had never before\nseen an African lawyer. I was received warmly by the magistrate and prosecutor, and the case did not begin for quite a while, as they asked me\nnumerous questions about my career and how I became a lawyer. The court was similarly crowded with curious townspeople.\nIn a nearby village I appeared for a local medicine man charged with witchcraft. This case also attracted a large crowd \u2014 not to see me, but to\nfind out whether the white man\u2019s laws could be applied to a sangoma. The medicine man exerted tremendous power in the area, and many people\nboth worshipped and feared him. At one point, my client sneezed violently, causing a virtual stampede in the courtroom; most observers believed\nhe was casting a spell. He was found not guilty, but I suspect that the local people attributed this not to my skill as a lawyer, but to the power of the\nmedicine man\u2019s herbs.\nAs an attorney, I could be rather flamboyant in court. I did not act as though I were a black man in a white man\u2019s court, but as if everyone else \u2014\nwhite and black \u2014 was a guest in my court. When trying a case, I often made sweeping gestures and used high-flown language. I was punctilious\nabout all court regulations, but I sometimes used unorthodox tactics with witnesses. I enjoyed cross-examinations, and often played on racial\ntension. The spectators\u2019 gallery was usually crowded, because people from the township attended court as a form of entertainment.\nI recall once defending an African woman employed as a domestic worker in town. She was accused of stealing her \u201cmadam\u2019s\u201d clothes. The\nclothing that was allegedly stolen was displayed on a table in court. After the \u201cmadam\u201d had testified, I began my cross-examination by walking over\nto the table of evidence. I perused the clothing and then, with the tip of my pencil, I picked up an item of ladies\u2019 underwear. I slowly turned to the\nwitness box brandishing the panties and simply asked, \u201cMadam, are these . . . yours?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she replied quickly, too embarrassed to admit that they\nwere hers. Because of this response, and other discrepancies in her evidence, the magistrate dismissed the case. I DID NOT return home after the verdict. Although others were in a festive mood, and eager to celebrate, I knew the authorities could strike at any\nmoment, and I did not want to give them the opportunity. I was anxious to be off before I was banned or arrested, and I spent the night in a safe\nhouse in Johannesburg. It was a restless night in a strange bed, and I started at the sound of every car, thinking it might be the police.\nWalter and Duma saw me off on the first leg of my journey, which was to take me to Port Elizabeth. In P.E., I met with Govan Mbeki and Raymond\nMhlaba to discuss the new underground structures of the organization. We met at the house of Dr. Masla Pather, who would later be sentenced to\ntwo years in prison for allowing us to meet at his home. At safe houses arranged by the organization, I met the editor of the liberal Port Elizabeth\nEvening Post to discuss the campaign for a national convention, a goal several newspapers subsequently endorsed. I later visited Patrick Duncan,\nthe editor and publisher of the liberal weekly Contact, a founding member of the Liberal Party, and one of the first white defiers during the Defiance\nCampaign. His newspaper had repeatedly been decrying ANC policy as being dictated by Communists, but when he saw me the first thing he said\nwas that a close reading of the Treason Trial record had disabused him of that notion and he would correct it in his paper.\nThat night I addressed a meeting of African township ministers in Cape Town. I mention this because the opening prayer of one of the ministers\nhas stayed with me over these many years and was a source of strength at a difficult time. He thanked the Lord for His bounty and goodness, for\nHis mercy and His concern for all men. But then he took the liberty of reminding the Lord that some of His subjects were more downtrodden than\nothers, and that it sometimes seemed as though He was not paying attention. The minister then said that if the Lord did not show a little more\ninitiative in leading the black man to salvation, the black man would have to take matters into his own two hands. Amen.\nOn my last morning in Cape Town, I was leaving my hotel in the company of George Peake, a founding member of the South African Coloured\nPeople\u2019s Organization, and I stopped to thank the Coloured manager of the hotel for looking after me so well. He was grateful, but also curious. He\nhad discovered my identity and told me that the Coloured community feared that under an African government they would be just as oppressed as\nunder the present white government. He was a middle-class businessman who probably had little contact with Africans, and feared them in the\nsame way as whites did. This was a frequent anxiety on the part of the Coloured community, especially in the Cape, and though I was running late, I\nexplained the Freedom Charter to this fellow and stressed our commitment to nonracialism. A freedom fighter must take every opportunity to make\nhis case to the people.\nThe following day I joined a secret meeting of the ANC National Executive Committee and the joint executives of the Congress movement in\nDurban to discuss whether the planned action should take the form of a stay-at-home or a full-fledged strike with organized pickets and\ndemonstrations. Those who argued for the strike said that the stay-at-home strategy we had used since  had outlasted its usefulness, that at a\ntime when the PAC was appealing to the masses, more militant forms of the struggle were necessary. The alternative view, which I advocated, was\nthat stay-at-homes allowed us to strike at the enemy while preventing him from striking back. I argued that the confidence of the people in our\ncampaigns had grown precisely because they realized that we were not reckless with their lives. Sharpeville, I said, for all the heroism of the\ndemonstrators, allowed the enemy to shoot down our people. I argued for stay-at-homes even though I was aware that our people around the\ncountry were becoming impatient with passive forms of struggle, but I did not think we should depart from our proven tactics without comprehensive\nplanning, and we had neither the time not the resources to do so. The decision was for a stay-at-home.\n\nLiving underground requires a seismic psychological shift. One has to plan every action, however small and seemingly insignificant. Nothing is\ninnocent. Everything is questioned. You cannot be yourself; you must fully inhabit whatever role you have assumed. In some ways, this is not much of\nan adaptation for a black man in South Africa. Under apartheid, a black man lived a shadowy life between legality and illegality, between openness\nand concealment. To be a black man in South Africa meant not to trust anything, which was not unlike living underground for one\u2019s entire life.\nI became a creature of the night. I would keep to my hideout during the day, and would emerge to do my work when it became dark. I operated\nmainly from Johannesburg, but I would travel as necessary. I stayed in empty flats, in people\u2019s houses, wherever I could be alone and\ninconspicuous. Although I am a gregarious person, I love solitude even more. I welcomed the opportunity to be by myself, to plan, to think, to plot.\nBut one can have too much of solitude. I was terribly lonesome for my wife and family.\nThe key to being underground is to be invisible. Just as there is a way to walk in a room in order to make yourself stand out, there is a way of\nwalking and behaving that makes you inconspicuous. As a leader, one often seeks prominence; as an outlaw, the opposite is true. When\nunderground I did not walk as tall or stand as straight. I spoke more softly, with less clarity and distinction. I was more passive, more unobtrusive; I\ndid not ask for things, but instead let people tell me what to do. I did not shave or cut my hair. My most frequent disguise was as a chauffeur, a chef,\nor a \u201cgarden boy.\u201d I would wear the blue overalls of the field-worker and often wore round, rimless glasses known as Mazzawati tea-glasses. I had a\ncar and I wore a chauffeur\u2019s cap with my overalls. The pose of chauffeur was convenient because I could travel under the pretext of driving my\nmaster\u2019s car.\nDuring those early months, when there was a warrant for my arrest and I was being pursued by the police, my outlaw existence caught the\nimagination of the press. Articles claiming that I had been here and there were on the front pages. Roadblocks were instituted all over the country,\nbut the police repeatedly came up empty-handed. I was dubbed the Black Pimpernel, a somewhat derogatory adaptation of Baroness Orczy\u2019s\nfictional character the Scarlet Pimpernel, who daringly evaded capture during the French Revolution.\nI traveled secretly about the country; I was with Muslims in the Cape; with sugar-workers in Natal; with factory workers in Port Elizabeth; I moved\nthrough townships in different parts of the country attending secret meetings at night. I would even feed the mythology of the Black Pimpernel by\ntaking a pocketful of \u201ctickeys\u201d  (threepenny pieces) and phoning individual newspaper reporters from telephone boxes and relaying to them\nstories of what we were planning or of the ineptitude of the police. I would pop up here and there to the annoyance of the police and to the delight of\nthe people.\nThere were many wild and inaccurate stories about my experiences underground. People love to embellish tales of daring. I did have a number\nof narrow escapes, however, which no one knew about. On one occasion, I was driving in town and I stopped at a traffic light. I looked to my left and\nin an adjacent car saw Colonel Spengler, the chief of the Witwatersrand Security Branch. It would have been a great plum for him to catch the Black\nPimpernel. I was wearing a workman\u2019s cap, my blue overalls, and my glasses. He never looked my way, but even so the seconds I spent waiting for\nthe light to change seemed like hours.\nOne afternoon, when I was in Johannesburg posing as a chauffeur and wearing my long duster and cap, I was waiting on a corner to be picked\nup and I saw an African policeman striding deliberately toward me. I looked around to see if I had a place to run, but before I did, he smiled at me\nand surreptitiously gave me the thumbs-up ANC salute and was gone. Incidents like this happened many times, and I was reassured when I saw\nthat we had the loyalty of many African policemen. There was a black sergeant who used to tip off Winnie as to what the police were doing. He\n\n\fwould whisper to her, \u201cMake sure Madiba is not in Alexandra on Wednesday night because there is going to be a raid.\u201d Black policemen have often\nbeen severely criticized during the struggle, but many have played covert roles that have been extremely valuable.\nWhen I was underground, I remained as unkempt as possible. My overalls looked as if they had been through a lifetime of hard toil. The police\nhad one picture of me with a beard, which they widely distributed, and my colleagues urged me to shave it off. But I had become attached to my\nbeard, and I resisted all efforts to get me to shave.\nNot only was I not recognized, I was sometimes snubbed. Once, I was planning to attend a meeting in a distant area of Johannesburg and a wellknown priest arranged with friends of his to put me up for the night. I arrived at the door, and before I could announce who I was, the elderly lady who\nanswered exclaimed, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t want such a man as you here!\u201d and shut the door.\n ALTHOUGH I HAD WANTED to journey to Qunu immediately after my release from prison, it was not until April that I was able to go. I could not pick\nup and leave whenever I wanted; security had to be arranged, as well as speeches prepared for local organizations. By April, the ANC and General\nBantu Holomisa, the military leader of the Transkei and an ANC loyalist, had arranged for a visit. But what was foremost in my mind and heart was\npaying my respects to my mother\u2019s grave.\nI went first to Qunu and the site where my mother was buried. Her grave was simple and unadorned, covered only by a few stones and some\nupturned bricks, no different from the other graves at Qunu. I find it difficult to describe my feelings: I felt regret that I had been unable to be with her\nwhen she died, remorse that I had not been able to look after her properly during her life, and a longing for what might have been had I chosen to\nlive my life differently.\nIn seeing my village again after so many years, I was greatly struck by what had changed and what had not. When I had been young, the people of\nQunu were not political at all; they were unaware of the struggle for African rights. People accepted life as it was and did not dream of changing it.\nBut when I returned I heard the schoolchildren of Qunu singing songs about Oliver Tambo and Umkhonto we Sizwe, and I marveled at how\nknowledge of the struggle had by then seeped into every corner of African society.\nWhat had endured was the warmth and simplicity of the community, which took me back to my days as a boy. But what disturbed me was that the\nvillagers seemed as poor if not poorer than they had been then. Most people still lived in simple huts with dirt floors, with no electricity and no\nrunning water. When I was young, the village was tidy, the water pure, and the grass green and unsullied as far as the eye could see. Kraals were\nswept, the topsoil was conserved, fields were neatly divided. But now the village was unswept, the water polluted, and the countryside littered with\nplastic bags and wrappers. We had not known of plastic when I was a boy, and though it surely improved life in some ways, its presence in Qunu\nappeared to me to be a kind of blight. Pride in the community seemed to have vanished.\n\nThat month, I had another homecoming: I returned to Robben Island in order to persuade twenty-five MK political prisoners to accept the\ngovernment\u2019s offer of amnesty and leave the island. Though I had left the island eight years before, my memories of prison were still fresh and\nuntinged by nostalgia. After all the years of being visited by others, it was a curious sensation to be a visitor on Robben Island.\nBut that day, I did not have much opportunity to sight-see for I met immediately with the men protesting the government offer of amnesty. They\nmaintained that they would leave only after a victory on the battlefield, not the negotiating table. They were fiercely opposed to this particular\nsettlement, in which they had to enumerate their crimes before receiving indemnity. They accused the ANC of retreating from the Harare\nDeclaration demand for an unconditional, blanket amnesty covering political prisoners and exiles. One man said, \u201cMadiba, I have been fighting the\ngovernment all my life, and now I have to ask for a pardon from them.\u201d\nI could sympathize with their arguments, but they were being unrealistic. Every soldier would like to defeat his enemy on the field, but in this case,\nsuch a victory was out of reach. The struggle was now at the negotiating table. I argued that they were not advancing the cause by remaining in jail.\nThey could be of greater service outside than inside. In the end, they agreed to accept the government\u2019s offer.\n* * *\nIn early June, I was scheduled to leave on a six-week tour of Europe and North America. Before going, I met privately with Mr. de Klerk, who wanted\nto discuss the issue of sanctions. Based on the changes he had made in South Africa, he asked me to mute the call for the continuation of\ninternational sanctions. While we were mindful of what Mr. de Klerk had done, in our view sanctions remained the best lever to force him to do\nmore. I was aware that the European Community and the States were inclined to relax sanctions based on Mr. de Klerk\u2019s reforms. I explained to Mr.\nde Klerk that we could not tell our supporters to relax sanctions until he had completely dismantled apartheid and a transitional government was in\nplace. While he was disappointed at my response, he was not surprised.\nThe first leg of the trip took Winnie and me to Paris, where we were treated in very grand style by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and his charming wife,\nDanielle, a longtime ANC supporter. This was not my first trip to the European mainland, but I was still entranced by the beauties of the Old World.\nAlthough I do not want to stint on the loveliness of the City of Light, the most important event that occurred while I was in France was that the\ngovernment announced the suspension of the State of Emergency. I was pleased, but well aware that they had taken this action while I was in\nEurope in order to undermine my call for sanctions.\nAfter stops in Switzerland, Italy, and the Netherlands, I went to England, where I spent two days visiting with Oliver and Adelaide. My next stop\nwas the United States, but I would be returning to England on my way back to South Africa, which is when I was scheduled to meet with Mrs.\nThatcher. As a courtesy, however, I phoned her before I left, and Mrs. Thatcher proceeded to give me a stern but well-meaning lecture: she said she\nhad been following my travels and noting how many events I attended each day. \u201cMr. Mandela, before we discuss any issues,\u201d she said, \u201cI must\nwarn you that your schedule is too heavy. You must cut it in half. Even a man half your age would have trouble meeting the demands that are being\nmade on you. If you keep this up, you will not come out of America alive. That is my advice to you.\u201d\n\nI had read about New York City since I was a young man, and finally to see it from the bottom of its great glass-and-concrete canyons while millions\nupon millions of pieces of ticker tape came floating down was a breathtaking experience. It was reported that as many as a million people\npersonally witnessed our procession through the city, and to see the support and enthusiasm they gave to the anti-apartheid struggle was truly\nhumbling. I had always read that New York was a hard-hearted place, but I felt the very opposite of that on my first full day in the city.\nThe following day I went up to Harlem, an area that had assumed legendary proportions in my mind since the s when I watched young men\nin Soweto emulate the fashions of Harlem dandies. Harlem, as my wife said, was the Soweto of America. I spoke to a great crowd at Yankee\nStadium, telling them that an unbreakable umbilical cord connected black South Africans and black Americans, for we were together children of\nAfrica. There was a kinship between the two, I said, that had been inspired by such great Americans as W. E. B. Du Bois, Marcus Garvey, and\nMartin Luther King Jr. As a young man, I idolized the Brown Bomber, Joe Louis, who took on not only his opponents in the ring but racists outside of\nit. In prison, I followed the struggle of black Americans against racism, discrimination, and economic inequality. To us, Harlem symbolized the\nstrength of resistance and the beauty of black pride. This was brought home to me by a young man I had seen the previous day who wore a T-shirt\nthat read, \u201cBLACK BY NATURE, PROUD BY CHOICE.\u201d We were linked by nature, I said, but we were proud of each other by choice.\nAfter journeying to Memphis and Boston, I went to Washington to address a joint session of Congress and attend a private meeting with\n\n\fPresident Bush. I thanked the U.S. Congress for its anti-apartheid legislation and said the new South Africa hoped to live up to the values that\ncreated the two chambers before which I spoke. I said that as freedom fighters we could not have known of such men as George Washington,\nAbraham Lincoln, and Thomas Jefferson \u201cand not been moved to act as they were moved to act.\u201d I also delivered a strong message on sanctions,\nfor I knew that the Bush administration felt it was time to loosen them. I urged Congress not to do so.\nEven before meeting Mr. Bush, I had formed a positive impression of him, for he was the first world leader to telephone me with congratulations\nafter I left prison. From that point on, President Bush included me on his short list of world leaders whom he briefed on important issues. In person,\nhe was just as warm and thoughtful, though we differed markedly on the issues of the armed struggle and sanctions. He was a man with whom one\ncould disagree and then shake hands.\nFrom the United States I proceeded to Canada, where I had a meeting with Prime Minister Mulroney and also addressed their Parliament. We\nwere due to go to Ireland next, and before crossing the Atlantic, our plane, a small jet, stopped for refueling in a remote place above the Arctic\nCircle called Goose Bay. I felt like having a walk in the brisk air, and as I was strolling on the tarmac, I noticed some people standing by the airport\nfence. I asked a Canadian official who they were. Eskimos, he said.\nIn my seventy-two years on earth I had never met an Innuit and never imagined that I would. I headed over to that fence and found a dozen or so\nyoung people, in their late teens, who had come out to the airport because they had heard our plane was going to stop there. I had read about the\nInnuit (the name \u201cEskimo\u201d was given to them by the colonists) as a boy, and the impression I received from the racist colonialist texts was that they\nwere a backward culture.\nBut in talking with these bright young people, I learned that they had watched my release on television and were familiar with events in South\nAfrica. \u201cViva ANC!\u201d one of them said. The Innuit are an aboriginal people historically mistreated by a white settler population; there were parallels\nbetween the plights of black South Africans and the Innuit people. What struck me so forcefully was how small the planet had become during my\ndecades in prison; it was amazing to me that a teenaged Innuit living at the roof of the world could watch the release of a political prisoner on the\nsouthern tip of Africa. Television had shrunk the world, and had in the process become a great weapon for eradicating ignorance and promoting\ndemocracy.\n\nAfter Dublin, I went to London, where I had a three-hour meeting with Mrs. Thatcher. Standing out in the cold talking with the young Innuits had given\nme a chill. On the day I was to see Mrs. Thatcher it was wintry and raining, and as we were leaving, Winnie told me I must take a raincoat. We were\nalready in the lobby of the hotel, and if I went back for my coat we would be late. I am a stickler about punctuality, not only because I think it is a sign\nof respect to the person you are meeting but in order to combat the Western stereotype of Africans as being notoriously tardy. I told Winnie we did\nnot have time, and instead I stood out in the rain signing autographs for some children. By the time I got to Mrs. Thatcher I was feeling poorly, and I\nwas later diagnosed as having a mild case of pneumonia.\nBut it did not interfere with our meeting, except that she chided me like a schoolmarm for not taking her advice and cutting down on my schedule.\nEven though Mrs. Thatcher was on the opposite side of the ANC on many issues, such as sanctions, she was always a forthright and solicitous\nlady. In our meeting that day, though, I could not make the slightest bit of headway with her on the question of sanctions.\n",
    "1953-1959": " APART FROM LIFE, a strong constitution, and an abiding connection to the Thembu royal house, the only thing my father bestowed upon me at\nbirth was a name, Rolihlahla. In Xhosa, Rolihlahla literally means \u201cpulling the branch of a tree,\u201d but its colloquial meaning more accurately would be\n\u201ctroublemaker.\u201d I do not believe that names are destiny or that my father somehow divined my future, but in later years, friends and relatives would\nascribe to my birth name the many storms I have both caused and weathered. My more familiar English or Christian name was not given to me until\nmy first day of school. But I am getting ahead of myself.\nI was born on the eighteenth of July, , at Mvezo, a tiny village on the banks of the Mbashe River in the district of Umtata, the capital of the\nTranskei. The year of my birth marked the end of the Great War; the outbreak of an influenza epidemic that killed millions throughout the world; and\nthe visit of a delegation of the African National Congress to the Versailles peace conference to voice the grievances of the African people of South\nAfrica. Mvezo, however, was a place apart, a tiny precinct removed from the world of great events, where life was lived much as it had been for\nhundreds of years.\nThe Transkei is eight hundred miles east of Cape Town, five hundred fifty miles south of Johannesburg, and lies between the Kei River and the\nNatal border, between the rugged Drakensberg mountains to the north and the blue waters of the Indian Ocean to the east. It is a beautiful country of\nrolling hills, fertile valleys, and a thousand rivers and streams, which keep the landscape green even in winter. The Transkei used to be one of the\nlargest territorial divisions within South Africa, covering an area the size of Switzerland, with a population of about three and a half million Xhosas\nand a tiny minority of Basothos and whites. It is home to the Thembu people, who are part of the Xhosa nation, of which I am a member.\nMy father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was a chief by both blood and custom. He was confirmed as chief of Mvezo by the king of the Thembu\ntribe, but under British rule, his selection had to be ratified by the government, which in Mvezo took the form of the local magistrate. As a\ngovernment-appointed chief, he was eligible for a stipend as well as a portion of the fees the government levied on the community for vaccination of\nlivestock and communal grazing land. Although the role of chief was a venerable and esteemed one, it had, even seventy-five years ago, become\ndebased by the control of an unsympathetic white government.\nThe Thembu tribe reaches back for twenty generations to King Zwide. According to tradition, the Thembu people lived in the foothills of the\nDrakensberg mountains and migrated toward the coast in the sixteenth century, where they were incorporated into the Xhosa nation. The Xhosa\nare part of the Nguni people who have lived, hunted, and fished in the rich and temperate southeastern region of South Africa, between the great\ninterior plateau to the north and the Indian Ocean to the south, since at least the eleventh century. The Nguni can be divided into a northern group \u2014\nthe Zulu and the Swazi people \u2014 and a southern group, which is made up of amaBaca, amaBomyana, amaGcaleka, amaMfengu, amaMpodomis,\namaMpondo, abeSotho, and abeThembu, and together they comprise the Xhosa nation.\nThe Xhosa are a proud and patrilineal people with an expressive and euphonious language and an abiding belief in the importance of laws,\neducation, and courtesy. Xhosa society was a balanced and harmonious social order in which every individual knew his or her place. Each Xhosa\nbelongs to a clan that traces its descent back to a specific forefather. I am a member of the Madiba clan, named after a Thembu chief who ruled in\nthe Transkei in the eighteenth century. I am often addressed as Madiba, my clan name, a term of respect.\nNgubengcuka, one of the greatest monarchs, who united the Thembu tribe, died in . As was the custom, he had wives from the principal\nroyal houses: the Great House, from which the heir is selected, the Right Hand House, and the Ixhiba, a minor house that is referred to by some as\nthe Left Hand House. It was the task of the sons of the Ixhiba or Left Hand House to settle royal disputes. Mthikrakra, the eldest son of the Great\nHouse, succeeded Ngubengcuka and amongst his sons were Ngangelizwe and Matanzima. Sabata, who ruled the Thembu from , was the\ngrandson of Ngangelizwe and a senior to Kalzer Daliwonga, better known as K. D. Matanzima, the former chief minister of the Transkei \u2014 my\nnephew, by law and custom \u2014 who was a descendant of Matanzima. The eldest son of the Ixhiba house was Simakade, whose younger brother\nwas Mandela, my grandfather.\nAlthough over the decades there have been many stories that I was in the line of succession to the Thembu throne, the simple genealogy I have\njust outlined exposes those tales as a myth. Although I was a member of the royal household, I was not among the privileged few who were trained\nfor rule. Instead, as a descendant of the Ixhiba house, I was groomed, like my father before me, to counsel the rulers of the tribe.\nMy father was a tall, dark-skinned man with a straight and stately posture, which I like to think I inherited. He had a tuft of white hair just above his\nforehead, and as a boy, I would take white ash and rub it into my hair in imitation of him. My father had a stern manner and did not spare the rod\nwhen disciplining his children. He could be exceedingly stubborn, another trait that may unfortunately have been passed down from father to son.\nMy father has sometimes been referred to as the prime minister of Thembuland during the reigns of Dalindyebo, the father of Sabata, who ruled\nin the early s, and that of his son, Jongintaba, who succeeded him. That is a misnomer in that no such title existed, but the role he played was\nnot so different from what the designation implies. As a respected and valued counselor to both kings, he accompanied them on their travels and\nwas usually to be found by their sides during important meetings with government officials. He was an acknowledged custodian of Xhosa history,\nand it was partially for that reason that he was valued as an adviser. My own interest in history had early roots and was encouraged by my father.\nAlthough my father could neither read nor write, he was reputed to be an excellent orator who captivated his audiences by entertaining them as well\nas teaching them.\nIn later years, I discovered that my father was not only an adviser to kings but a kingmaker. After the untimely death of Jongilizwe in the s, his\nson Sabata, the infant of the Great Wife, was too young to ascend to the throne. A dispute arose as to which of Dalindyebo\u2019s three most senior\nsons from other mothers \u2014 Jongintaba, Dabulamanzi, and Melithafa \u2014 should be selected to succeed him. My father was consulted and\nrecommended Jongintaba on the grounds that he was the best educated. Jongintaba, he argued, would not only be a fine custodian of the crown\nbut an excellent mentor to the young prince. My father, and a few other influential chiefs, had the great respect for education that is often present in\nthose who are uneducated. The recommendation was controversial, for Jongintaba\u2019s mother was from a lesser house, but my father\u2019s choice was\nultimately accepted by both the Thembus and the British government. In time, Jongintaba would return the favor in a way that my father could not\nthen imagine.\nAll told, my father had four wives, the third of whom, my mother, Nosekeni Fanny, the daughter of Nkedama from the amaMpemvu clan of the\nXhosa, belonged to the Right Hand House. Each of these wives \u2014 the Great Wife, the Right Hand wife (my mother), the Left Hand wife, and the\nwife of the Iqadi or support house \u2014 had her own kraal. A kraal was a homestead and usually included a simple fenced-in enclosure for animals,\nfields for growing crops, and one or more thatched huts. The kraals of my father\u2019s wives were separated by many miles and he commuted among\nthem. In these travels, my father sired thirteen children in all, four boys and nine girls. I am the eldest child of the Right Hand House, and the\nyoungest of my father\u2019s four sons. I have three sisters, Baliwe, who was the oldest girl, Notancu, and Makhutswana. Although the eldest of my\nfather\u2019s sons was Mlahlwa, my father\u2019s heir as chief was Daligqili, the son of the Great House, who died in the early s. All of his sons, with the\nexception of myself, are now deceased, and each was my senior not only in age but in status.\n\n\fWhen I was not much more than a newborn child, my father was involved in a dispute that deprived him of his chieftainship at Mvezo and revealed a\nstrain in his character I believe he passed on to his son. I maintain that nurture, rather than nature, is the primary molder of personality, but my father\npossessed a proud rebelliousness, a stubborn sense of fairness, that I recognize in myself. As a chief \u2014 or headman, as it was often known among\nthe whites \u2014 my father was compelled to account for his stewardship not only to the Thembu king but to the local magistrate. One day one of my\nfather\u2019s subjects lodged a complaint against him involving an ox that had strayed from its owner. The magistrate accordingly sent a message\nordering my father to appear before him. When my father received the summons, he sent back the following reply: \u201cAndizi, ndisaqula\u201d (I will not\ncome, I am still girding for battle). One did not defy magistrates in those days. Such behavior would be regarded as the height of insolence \u2014 and\nin this case it was.\nMy father\u2019s response bespoke his belief that the magistrate had no legitimate power over him. When it came to tribal matters, he was guided not\nby the laws of the king of England, but by Thembu custom. This defiance was not a fit of pique, but a matter of principle. He was asserting his\ntraditional prerogative as a chief and was challenging the authority of the magistrate.\nWhen the magistrate received my father\u2019s response, he promptly charged him with insubordination. There was no inquiry or investigation; that\nwas reserved for white civil servants. The magistrate simply deposed my father, thus ending the Mandela family chieftainship.\nI was unaware of these events at the time, but I was not unaffected. My father, who was a wealthy nobleman by the standards of his time, lost both\nhis fortune and his title. He was deprived of most of his herd and land, and the revenue that came with them. Because of our straitened\ncircumstances, my mother moved to Qunu, a slightly larger village north of Mvezo, where she would have the support of friends and relations. We\nlived in a less grand style in Qunu, but it was in that village near Umtata that I spent the happiest years of my boyhood and whence I trace my\nearliest memories.\n THE VILLAGE OF QUNU was situated in a narrow, grassy valley crisscrossed by clear streams, and overlooked by green hills. It consisted of no\nmore than a few hundred people who lived in huts, which were beehive-shaped structures of mud walls, with a wooden pole in the center holding up\na peaked, grass roof. The floor was made of crushed ant-heap, the hard dome of excavated earth above an ant colony, and was kept smooth by\nsmearing it regularly with fresh cow dung. The smoke from the hearth escaped through the roof, and the only opening was a low doorway one had to\nstoop to walk through. The huts were generally grouped together in a residential area that was some distance away from the maize fields. There\nwere no roads, only paths through the grass worn away by barefooted boys and women. The women and children of the village wore blankets dyed\nin ocher; only the few Christians in the village wore Western-style clothing. Cattle, sheep, goats, and horses grazed together in common pastures.\nThe land around Qunu was mostly treeless except for a cluster of poplars on a hill overlooking the village. The land itself was owned by the state.\nWith very few exceptions, Africans at the time did not enjoy private title to land in South Africa but were tenants paying rent annually to the\ngovernment. In the area, there were two small primary schools, a general store, and a dipping tank to rid the cattle of ticks and diseases.\nMaize (what we called mealies and people in the West call corn), sorghum, beans, and pumpkins formed the largest portion of our diet, not\nbecause of any inherent preference for these foods, but because the people could not afford anything richer. The wealthier families in our village\nsupplemented their diets with tea, coffee, and sugar, but for most people in Qunu these were exotic luxuries far beyond their means. The water\nused for farming, cooking, and washing had to be fetched in buckets from streams and springs. This was women\u2019s work, and indeed, Qunu was a\nvillage of women and children: most of the men spent the greater part of the year working on remote farms or in the mines along the Reef, the great\nridge of gold-bearing rock and shale that forms the southern boundary of Johannesburg. They returned perhaps twice a year, mainly to plow their\nfields. The hoeing, weeding, and harvesting were left to the women and children. Few if any of the people in the village knew how to read or write,\nand the concept of education was still a foreign one to many.\nMy mother presided over three huts at Qunu which, as I remember, were always filled with the babies and children of my relations. In fact, I hardly\nrecall any occasion as a child when I was alone. In African culture, the sons and daughters of one\u2019s aunts or uncles are considered brothers and\nsisters, not cousins. We do not make the same distinctions among relations practiced by whites. We have no half brothers or half sisters. My\nmother\u2019s sister is my mother; my uncle\u2019s son is my brother; my brother\u2019s child is my son, my daughter.\nOf my mother\u2019s three huts, one was used for cooking, one for sleeping, and one for storage. In the hut in which we slept, there was no furniture in\nthe Western sense. We slept on mats and sat on the ground. I did not discover pillows until I went to Mqhekezweni. My mother cooked food in a\nthree-legged iron pot over an open fire in the center of the hut or outside. Everything we ate we grew and made ourselves. My mother planted and\nharvested her own mealies. Mealies were harvested from the field when they were hard and dry. They were stored in sacks or pits dug in the\nground. When preparing the mealies, the women used different methods. They could grind the kernels between two stones to make bread, or boil\nthe mealies first, producing umphothulo (mealie flour eaten with sour milk) or umngqusho (samp, sometimes plain or mixed with beans). Unlike\nmealies, which were sometimes in short supply, milk from our cows and goats was always plentiful.\nFrom an early age, I spent most of my free time in the veld playing and fighting with the other boys of the village. A boy who remained at home\ntied to his mother\u2019s apron strings was regarded as a sissy. At night, I shared my food and blanket with these same boys. I was no more than five\nwhen I became a herd-boy, looking after sheep and calves in the fields. I discovered the almost mystical attachment that the Xhosa have for cattle,\nnot only as a source of food and wealth, but as a blessing from God and a source of happiness. It was in the fields that I learned how to knock birds\nout of the sky with a slingshot, to gather wild honey and fruits and edible roots, to drink warm, sweet milk straight from the udder of a cow, to swim in\nthe clear, cold streams, and to catch fish with twine and sharpened bits of wire. I learned to stick-fight \u2014 essential knowledge to any rural African\nboy \u2014 and became adept at its various techniques, parrying blows, feinting in one direction and striking in another, breaking away from an\nopponent with quick footwork. From these days I date my love of the veld, of open spaces, the simple beauties of nature, the clean line of the\nhorizon.\nAs boys, we were mostly left to our own devices. We played with toys we made ourselves. We molded animals and birds out of clay. We made\nox-drawn sleighs out of tree branches. Nature was our playground. The hills above Qunu were dotted with large smooth rocks which we transformed\ninto our own roller coaster. We sat on flat stones and slid down the face of the large rocks. We did this until our backsides were so sore we could\nhardly sit down. I learned to ride by sitting atop weaned calves \u2014 after being thrown to the ground several times, one got the hang of it.\nI learned my lesson one day from an unruly donkey. We had been taking turns climbing up and down its back and when my chance came I\njumped on and the donkey bolted into a nearby thornbush. It bent its head, trying to unseat me, which it did, but not before the thorns had pricked\nand scratched my face, embarrassing me in front of my friends. Like the people of the East, Africans have a highly developed sense of dignity, or\nwhat the Chinese call \u201cface.\u201d I had lost face among my friends. Even though it was a donkey that unseated me, I learned that to humiliate another\nperson is to make him suffer an unnecessarily cruel fate. Even as a boy, I defeated my opponents without dishonoring them.\nUsually the boys played among themselves, but we sometimes allowed our sisters to join us. Boys and girls would play games like ndize (hideand-seek) and icekwa (touch-and-run). But the game I most enjoyed playing with the girls was what we called khetha, or choose-the-one-you-like.\nThis was not so much an organized game, but a spur-of-the-moment sport that took place when we accosted a group of girls our own age and\ndemanded that each select the boy she loved. Our rules dictated that the girl\u2019s choice be respected and once she had chosen her favorite, she was\nfree to continue on her journey escorted by the lucky boy she loved. But the girls were nimble-witted \u2014 far cleverer than we doltish lads \u2014 and\nwould often confer among themselves and choose one boy, usually the plainest fellow, and then tease him all the way home.\nThe most popular game for boys was thinti, and like most boys\u2019 games it was a youthful approximation of war. Two sticks, used as targets, would\nbe driven firmly into the ground in an upright position about one hundred feet apart. The goal of the game was for each team to hurl sticks at the\nopposing target and knock it down. We each defended our own target and attempted to prevent the other side from retrieving the sticks that had\nbeen thrown over. As we grew older, we organized matches against boys from neighboring villages, and those who distinguished themselves in\nthese fraternal battles were greatly admired, as generals who achieve great victories in war are justly celebrated.\nAfter games such as these, I would return to my mother\u2019s kraal where she was preparing supper. Whereas my father once told stories of historic\nbattles and heroic Xhosa warriors, my mother would enchant us with Xhosa legends and fables that had come down from numberless generations.\nThese tales stimulated my childish imagination, and usually contained some moral lesson. I recall one story my mother told us about a traveler who\nwas approached by an old woman with terrible cataracts on her eyes. The woman asked the traveler for help, and the man averted his eyes. Then\nanother man came along and was approached by the old woman. She asked him to clean her eyes, and even though he found the task unpleasant,\nhe did as she asked. Then, miraculously, the scales fell from the old woman\u2019s eyes and she became young and beautiful. The man married her and\nbecame wealthy and prosperous. It is a simple tale, but its message is an enduring one: virtue and generosity will be rewarded in ways that one\ncannot know.\n\n\fLike all Xhosa children, I acquired knowledge mainly through observation. We were meant to learn through imitation and emulation, not through\nquestions. When I first visited the homes of whites, I was often dumbfounded by the number and nature of questions that children asked of their\nparents \u2014 and their parents\u2019 unfailing willingness to answer them. In my household, questions were considered a nuisance; adults imparted\ninformation as they considered necessary.\nMy life, and that of most Xhosas at the time, was shaped by custom, ritual, and taboo. This was the alpha and omega of our existence, and went\nunquestioned. Men followed the path laid out for them by their fathers; women led the same lives as their mothers had before them. Without being\ntold, I soon assimilated the elaborate rules that governed the relations between men and women. I discovered that a man may not enter a house\nwhere a woman has recently given birth, and that a newly married woman would not enter the kraal of her new home without elaborate ceremony. I\nalso learned that to neglect one\u2019s ancestors would bring ill-fortune and failure in life. If you dishonored your ancestors in some fashion, the only way\nto atone for that lapse was to consult with a traditional healer or tribal elder, who communicated with the ancestors and conveyed profound\napologies. All of these beliefs seemed perfectly natural to me.\nI came across few whites as a boy at Qunu. The local magistrate, of course, was white, as was the nearest shopkeeper. Occasionally white\ntravelers or policemen passed through our area. These whites appeared as grand as gods to me, and I was aware that they were to be treated with\na mixture of fear and respect. But their role in my life was a distant one, and I thought little if at all about the white man in general or relations\nbetween my own people and these curious and remote figures.\nThe only rivalry between different clans or tribes in our small world at Qunu was that between the Xhosas and the amaMfengu, a small number of\nwhom lived in our village. AmaMfengu arrived on the eastern Cape after fleeing from Shaka Zulu\u2019s armies in a period known as the iMfecane, the\ngreat wave of battles and migrations between  and  set in motion by the rise of Shaka and the Zulu state, during which the Zulu warrior\nsought to conquer and then unite all the tribes under military rule. AmaMfengu, who were not originally Xhosa-speakers, were refugees from the\niMfecane and were forced to do jobs that no other African would do. They worked on white farms and in white businesses, something that was\nlooked down upon by the more established Xhosa tribes. But amaMfengu were an industrious people, and because of their contact with\nEuropeans, they were often more educated and \u201cWestern\u201d than other Africans.\nWhen I was a boy, amaMfengu were the most advanced section of the community and furnished our clergymen, policemen, teachers, clerks, and\ninterpreters. They were also amongst the first to become Christians, to build better houses, and to use scientific methods of agriculture, and they\nwere wealthier than their Xhosa compatriots. They confirmed the missionaries\u2019 axiom, that to be Christian was to be civilized, and to be civilized\nwas to be Christian. There still existed some hostility toward amaMfengu, but in retrospect, I would attribute this more to jealousy than tribal\nanimosity. This local form of tribalism that I observed as a boy was relatively harmless. At that stage, I did not witness nor even suspect the violent\ntribal rivalries that would subsequently be promoted by the white rulers of South Africa.\nMy father did not subscribe to local prejudice toward amaMfengu and befriended two amaMfengu brothers, George and Ben Mbekela. The\nbrothers were an exception in Qunu: they were educated and Christian. George, the older of the two, was a retired teacher and Ben was a police\nsergeant. Despite the proselytizing of the Mbekela brothers, my father remained aloof from Christianity and instead reserved his own faith for the\ngreat spirit of the Xhosas, Qamata, the God of his fathers. My father was an unofficial priest and presided over ritual slaughtering of goats and\ncalves and officiated at local traditional rites concerning planting, harvest, birth, marriage, initiation ceremonies, and funerals. He did not need to be\nordained, for the traditional religion of the Xhosas is characterized by a cosmic wholeness, so that there is little distinction between the sacred and\nthe secular, between the natural and the supernatural.\nWhile the faith of the Mbekela brothers did not rub off on my father, it did inspire my mother, who became a Christian. In fact, Fanny was literally\nher Christian name, for she had been given it in church. It was due to the influence of the Mbekela brothers that I myself was baptized into the\nMethodist, or Wesleyan Church as it was then known, and sent to school. The brothers would often see me playing or minding sheep and come\nover to talk to me. One day, George Mbekela paid a visit to my mother. \u201cYour son is a clever young fellow,\u201d he said. \u201cHe should go to school.\u201d My\nmother remained silent. No one in my family had ever attended school and my mother was unprepared for Mbekela\u2019s suggestion. But she did relay\nit to my father, who despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 his own lack of education immediately decided that his youngest son should go to school.\nThe schoolhouse consisted of a single room, with a Western-style roof, on the other side of the hill from Qunu. I was seven years old, and on the\nday before I was to begin, my father took me aside and told me that I must be dressed properly for school. Until that time, I, like all the other boys in\nQunu, had worn only a blanket, which was wrapped around one shoulder and pinned at the waist. My father took a pair of his trousers and cut them\nat the knee. He told me to put them on, which I did, and they were roughly the correct length, although the waist was far too large. My father then took\na piece of string and cinched the trousers at the waist. I must have been a comical sight, but I have never owned a suit I was prouder to wear than\nmy father\u2019s cut-off pants.\nOn the first day of school, my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of us an English name and said that from thenceforth that was the name we\nwould answer to in school. This was the custom among Africans in those days and was undoubtedly due to the British bias of our education. The\neducation I received was a British education, in which British ideas, British culture, British institutions, were automatically assumed to be superior.\nThere was no such thing as African culture.\nAfricans of my generation \u2014 and even today \u2014 generally have both an English and an African name. Whites were either unable or unwilling to\npronounce an African name, and considered it uncivilized to have one. That day, Miss Mdingane told me that my new name was Nelson. Why she\nbestowed this particular name upon me I have no idea. Perhaps it had something to do with the great British sea captain Lord Nelson, but that\nwould be only a guess.\n ONE NIGHT, when I was nine years old, I was aware of a commotion in the household. My father, who took turns visiting his wives and usually came\nto us for perhaps one week a month, had arrived. But it was not at his accustomed time, for he was not scheduled to be with us for another few\ndays. I found him in my mother\u2019s hut, lying on his back on the floor, in the midst of what seemed like an endless fit of coughing. Even to my young\neyes, it was clear that my father was not long for this world. He was ill with some type of lung disease, but it was not diagnosed, as my father had\nnever visited a doctor. He remained in the hut for several days without moving or speaking, and then one night he took a turn for the worse. My\nmother and my father\u2019s youngest wife, Nodayimani, who had come to stay with us, were looking after him, and late that night he called for\nNodayimani. \u201cBring me my tobacco,\u201d he told her. My mother and Nodayimani conferred, and decided that it was unwise that he have tobacco in his\ncurrent state. But he persisted in calling for it, and eventually Nodayimani filled his pipe, lit it, and then handed it to him. My father smoked and\nbecame calm. He continued smoking for perhaps an hour, and then, his pipe still lit, he died.\nI do not remember experiencing great grief so much as feeling cut adrift. Although my mother was the center of my existence, I defined myself\nthrough my father. My father\u2019s passing changed my whole life in a way that I did not suspect at the time. After a brief period of mourning, my mother\ninformed me that I would be leaving Qunu. I did not ask her why, or where I was going.\nI packed the few things that I possessed, and early one morning we set out on a journey westward to my new residence. I mourned less for my\nfather than for the world I was leaving behind. Qunu was all that I knew, and I loved it in the unconditional way that a child loves his first home. Before\nwe disappeared behind the hills, I turned and looked for what I imagined was the last time at my village. I could see the simple huts and the people\ngoing about their chores; the stream where I had splashed and played with the other boys; the maize fields and green pastures where the herds and\nflocks were lazily grazing. I imagined my friends out hunting for small birds, drinking the sweet milk from the cow\u2019s udder, cavorting in the pond at\nthe end of the stream. Above all else, my eyes rested on the three simple huts where I had enjoyed my mother\u2019s love and protection. It was these\nthree huts that I associated with all my happiness, with life itself, and I rued the fact that I had not kissed each of them before I left. I could not\nimagine that the future I was walking toward could compare in any way to the past that I was leaving behind.\nWe traveled by foot and in silence until the sun was sinking slowly toward the horizon. But the silence of the heart between mother and child is not\na lonely one. My mother and I never talked very much, but we did not need to. I never doubted her love or questioned her support. It was an\nexhausting journey, along rocky dirt roads, up and down hills, past numerous villages, but we did not pause. Late in the afternoon, at the bottom of a\nshallow valley surrounded by trees, we came upon a village at the center of which was a large and gracious home that so far exceeded anything\nthat I had ever seen that all I could do was marvel at it. The buildings consisted of two iingxande (rectangular houses) and seven stately rondavels\n(superior huts), all washed in white lime, dazzling even in the light of the setting sun. There was a large front garden and a maize field bordered by\nrounded peach trees. An even more spacious garden spread out in back, which boasted apple trees, a vegetable garden, a strip of flowers, and a\npatch of wattles. Nearby was a white stucco church.\nIn the shade of two gum trees that graced the doorway of the front of the main house sat a group of about twenty tribal elders. Encircling the\nproperty, contentedly grazing on the rich land, was a herd of at least fifty cattle and perhaps five hundred sheep. Everything was beautifully tended,\nand it was a vision of wealth and order beyond my imagination. This was the Great Place, Mqhekezweni, the provisional capital of Thembuland, the\nroyal residence of Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo, acting regent of the Thembu people.\nAs I contemplated all this grandeur, an enormous motorcar rumbled through the western gate and the men sitting in the shade immediately arose.\nThey doffed their hats and then jumped to their feet shouting, \u201cBayete a-a-a, Jongintaba!\u201d (Hail, Jongintaba!), the traditional salute of the Xhosas for\ntheir chief. Out of the motorcar (I learned later that this majestic vehicle was a Ford V) stepped a short, thickset man wearing a smart suit. I could\nsee that he had the confidence and bearing of a man who was used to the exercise of authority. His name suited him, for Jongintaba literally means\n\u201cOne who looks at the mountain,\u201d and he was a man with a sturdy presence toward whom all eyes gazed. He had a dark complexion and an\nintelligent face, and he casually shook hands with each of the men beneath the tree, men who as I later discovered comprised the highest Thembu\ncourt of justice. This was the regent who was to become my guardian and benefactor for the next decade.\nIn that moment of beholding Jongintaba and his court I felt like a sapling pulled root and branch from the earth and flung into the center of a\nstream whose strong current I could not resist. I felt a sense of awe mixed with bewilderment. Until then I had had no thoughts of anything but my own\npleasures, no higher ambition than to eat well and become a champion stick-fighter. I had no thought of money, or class, or fame, or power.\nSuddenly a new world opened before me. Children from poor homes often find themselves beguiled by a host of new temptations when suddenly\nconfronted by great wealth. I was no exception. I felt many of my established beliefs and loyalties begin to ebb away. The slender foundation built by\nmy parents began to shake. In that instant, I saw that life might hold more for me than being a champion stick-fighter.\n* * *\nI learned later that, in the wake of my father\u2019s death, Jongintaba had offered to become my guardian. He would treat me as he treated his other\nchildren, and I would have the same advantages as they. My mother had no choice; one did not turn down such an overture from the regent. She\nwas satisfied that although she would miss me, I would have a more advantageous upbringing in the regent\u2019s care than in her own. The regent had\nnot forgotten that it was due to my father\u2019s intervention that he had become acting paramount chief.\nMy mother remained in Mqhekezweni for a day or two before returning to Qunu. Our parting was without fuss. She offered no sermons, no words\nof wisdom, no kisses. I suspect she did not want me to feel bereft at her departure and so was matter-of-fact. I knew that my father had wanted me\nto be educated and prepared for a wide world, and I could not do that in Qunu. Her tender look was all the affection and support I needed, and as\nshe departed she turned to me and said, \u201cUqinisufokotho, Kwedini!\u201d (Brace yourself, my boy!) Children are often the least sentimental of creatures,\nespecially if they are absorbed in some new pleasure. Even as my dear mother and first friend was leaving, my head was swimming with the\ndelights of my new home. How could I not be braced up? I was already wearing the handsome new outfit purchased for me by my guardian.\nI was quickly caught up in the daily life of Mqhekezweni. A child adapts rapidly, or not at all \u2014 and I had taken to the Great Place as though I had\nbeen raised there. To me, it was a magical kingdom; everything was delightful; the chores that were tedious in Qunu became an adventure in\nMqhekezweni. When I was not in school, I was a plowboy, a wagon guide, a shepherd. I rode horses and shot birds with slingshots and found boys\nto joust with, and some nights I danced the evening away to the beautiful singing and clapping of Thembu maidens. Although I missed Qunu and my\nmother, I was completely absorbed in my new world.\nI attended a one-room school next door to the palace and studied English, Xhosa, history, and geography. We read Chambers English Reader\nand did our lessons on black slates. Our teachers, Mr. Fadana, and later, Mr. Giqwa, took a special interest in me. I did well in school not so much\nthrough cleverness as through doggedness. My own self-discipline was reinforced by my aunt Phathiwe, who lived in the Great Place and\n\n\fscrutinized my homework every night.\nMqhekezweni was a mission station of the Methodist Church and far more up-to-date and Westernized than Qunu. People dressed in modern\nclothes. The men wore suits and the women affected the severe Protestant style of the missionaries: thick long skirts and high-necked blouses, with\na blanket draped over the shoulder and a scarf wound elegantly around the head.\n\nIf the world of Mqhekezweni revolved around the regent, my smaller world revolved around his two children. Justice, the elder, was his only son and\nheir to the Great Place, and Nomafu was the regent\u2019s daughter. I lived with them and was treated exactly as they were. We ate the same food, wore\nthe same clothes, performed the same chores. We were later joined by Nxeko, the older brother to Sabata, the heir to the throne. The four of us\nformed a royal quartet. The regent and his wife No-England brought me up as if I were their own child. They worried about me, guided me, and\npunished me, all in a spirit of loving fairness. Jongintaba was stern, but I never doubted his love. They called me by the pet name of Tatomkhulu,\nwhich means \u201cGrandpa,\u201d because they said when I was very serious, I looked like an old man.\nJustice was four years older than I and became my first hero after my father. I looked up to him in every way. He was already at Clarkebury, a\nboarding school about sixty miles distant. Tall, handsome, and muscular, he was a fine sportsman, excelling in track and field, cricket, rugby, and\nsoccer. Cheerful and outgoing, he was a natural performer who enchanted audiences with his singing and transfixed them with his ballroom\ndancing. He had a bevy of female admirers \u2014 but also a coterie of critics, who considered him a dandy and a playboy. Justice and I became the\nbest of friends, though we were opposites in many ways: he was extroverted, I was introverted; he was lighthearted, I was serious. Things came\neasily to him; I had to drill myself. To me, he was everything a young man should be and everything I longed to be. Though we were treated alike, our\ndestinies were different: Justice would inherit one of the most powerful chieftainships of the Thembu tribe, while I would inherit whatever the regent,\nin his generosity, decided to give me.\nEvery day I was in and out of the regent\u2019s house doing errands. Of the chores I did for the regent, the one I enjoyed most was pressing his suits, a\njob in which I took great pride. He owned half-a-dozen Western suits, and I spent many an hour carefully making the crease in his trousers. His\npalace, as it were, consisted of two large Western-style houses with tin roofs. In those days, very few Africans had Western houses and they were\nconsidered a mark of great wealth. Six rondavels stood in a semicircle around the main house. They had wooden floorboards, something I had\nnever seen before. The regent and the queen slept in the right-hand rondavel, the queen\u2019s sister in the center one, and the left-hand hut served as a\npantry. Under the floor of the queen\u2019s sister\u2019s hut was a beehive, and we would sometimes take up a floorboard or two and feast on its honey.\nShortly after I moved to Mqhekezweni, the regent and his wife moved to the uxande (middle house), which automatically became the Great House.\nThere were three small rondavels near it: one for the regent\u2019s mother, one for visitors, and one shared by Justice and myself.\n\nThe two principles that governed my life at Mqhekezweni were chieftaincy and the Church. These two doctrines existed in uneasy harmony,\nalthough I did not then see them as antagonistic. For me, Christianity was not so much a system of beliefs as it was the powerful creed of a single\nman: Reverend Matyolo. For me, his powerful presence embodied all that was alluring in Christianity. He was as popular and beloved as the\nregent, and the fact that he was the regent\u2019s superior in spiritual matters made a strong impression on me. But the Church was as concerned with\nthis world as the next: I saw that virtually all of the achievements of Africans seemed to have come about through the missionary work of the Church.\nThe mission schools trained the clerks, the interpreters, and the policemen, who at the time represented the height of African aspirations.\nReverend Matyolo was a stout man in his mid-fifties, with a deep and potent voice that lent itself to both preaching and singing. When he\npreached at the simple church at the western end of Mqhekezweni, the hall was always brimming with people. The hall rang with the hosannas of\nthe faithful, while the women knelt at his feet to beg for salvation. The first tale I heard about him when I arrived at the Great Place was that the\nreverend had chased away a dangerous ghost with only a Bible and a lantern as weapons. I saw neither implausibility nor contradiction in this story.\nThe Methodism preached by Reverend Matyolo was of the fire-and-brimstone variety, seasoned with a bit of African animism. The Lord was wise\nand omnipotent, but He was also a vengeful God who let no bad deed go unpunished.\nAt Qunu, the only time I had ever attended church was on the day that I was baptized. Religion was a ritual that I indulged in for my mother\u2019s sake\nand to which I attached no meaning. But at Mqhekezweni, religion was a part of the fabric of life and I attended church each Sunday along with the\nregent and his wife. The regent took his religion very seriously. In fact the only time that I was ever given a hiding by him was when I dodged a\nSunday service to take part in a fight against boys from another village, a transgression I never committed again.\nThat was not the only rebuke I received on account of my trespasses against the reverend. One afternoon, I crept into Reverend Matyolo\u2019s garden\nand stole some maize, which I roasted and ate right there. A young girl saw me eating the corn in the garden and immediately reported my\npresence to the priest. The news quickly made the rounds and reached the regent\u2019s wife. That evening, she waited until prayer time \u2014 which was a\ndaily ritual in the house \u2014 and confronted me with my misdeed, reproaching me for taking the bread from a poor servant of God and disgracing the\nfamily. She said the devil would certainly take me to task for my sin. I felt an unpleasant mixture of fear and shame \u2014 fear that I would get some\ncosmic comeuppance and shame that I had abused the trust of my adopted family.\n\nBecause of the universal respect the regent enjoyed \u2014 from both black and white \u2014 and the seemingly untempered power that he wielded, I saw\nchieftaincy as being the very center around which life revolved. The power and influence of chieftaincy pervaded every aspect of our lives in\nMqhekezweni and was the preeminent means through which one could achieve influence and status.\nMy later notions of leadership were profoundly influenced by observing the regent and his court. I watched and learned from the tribal meetings\nthat were regularly held at the Great Place. These were not scheduled, but were called as needed, and were held to discuss national matters such\nas a drought, the culling of cattle, policies ordered by the magistrate, or new laws decreed by the government. All Thembus were free to come \u2014\nand a great many did, on horseback or by foot.\nOn these occasions, the regent was surrounded by his amaphakathi, a group of councilors of high rank who functioned as the regent\u2019s\nparliament and judiciary. They were wise men who retained the knowledge of tribal history and custom in their heads and whose opinions carried\ngreat weight.\nLetters advising these chiefs and headmen of a meeting were dispatched from the regent, and soon the Great Place became alive with\nimportant visitors and travelers from all over Thembuland. The guests would gather in the courtyard in front of the regent\u2019s house and he would open\nthe meeting by thanking everyone for coming and explaining why he had summoned them. From that point on, he would not utter another word until\nthe meeting was nearing its end.\n\n\fEveryone who wanted to speak did so. It was democracy in its purest form. There may have been a hierarchy of importance among the\nspeakers, but everyone was heard, chief and subject, warrior and medicine man, shopkeeper and farmer, landowner and laborer. People spoke\nwithout interruption and the meetings lasted for many hours. The foundation of self-government was that all men were free to voice their opinions\nand equal in their value as citizens. (Women, I am afraid, were deemed second-class citizens.)\nA great banquet was served during the day, and I often gave myself a bellyache by eating too much while listening to speaker after speaker. I\nnoticed how some speakers rambled and never seemed to get to the point. I grasped how others came to the matter at hand directly, and who\nmade a set of arguments succinctly and cogently. I observed how some speakers used emotion and dramatic language, and tried to move the\naudience with such techniques, while other speakers were sober and even, and shunned emotion.\nAt first, I was astonished by the vehemence \u2014 and candor \u2014 with which people criticized the regent. He was not above criticism \u2014 in fact, he\nwas often the principal target of it. But no matter how flagrant the charge, the regent simply listened, not defending himself, showing no emotion at\nall.\nThe meetings would continue until some kind of consensus was reached. They ended in unanimity or not at all. Unanimity, however, might be an\nagreement to disagree, to wait for a more propitious time to propose a solution. Democracy meant all men were to be heard, and a decision was\ntaken together as a people. Majority rule was a foreign notion. A minority was not to be crushed by a majority.\nOnly at the end of the meeting, as the sun was setting, would the regent speak. His purpose was to sum up what had been said and form some\nconsensus among the diverse opinions. But no conclusion was forced on people who disagreed. If no agreement could be reached, another\nmeeting would be held. At the very end of the council, a praise-singer or poet would deliver a panegyric to the ancient kings, and a mixture of\ncompliments to and satire on the present chiefs, and the audience, led by the regent, would roar with laughter.\nAs a leader, I have always followed the principles I first saw demonstrated by the regent at the Great Place. I have always endeavored to listen to\nwhat each and every person in a discussion had to say before venturing my own opinion. Oftentimes, my own opinion will simply represent a\nconsensus of what I heard in the discussion. I always remember the regent\u2019s axiom: a leader, he said, is like a shepherd. He stays behind the flock,\nletting the most nimble go out ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind.\n\nIt was at Mqhekezweni that I developed my interest in African history. Until then I had heard only of Xhosa heroes, but at the Great Place I learned of\nother African heroes like Sekhukhune, king of the Bapedi, and the Basotho king, Moshoeshoe, and Dingane, king of the Zulus, and others such as\nBambatha, Hintsa and Makana, Montshiwa and Kgama. I learned of these men from the chiefs and headmen who came to the Great Place to settle\ndisputes and try cases. Though not lawyers, these men presented cases and then adjudicated them. Some days, they would finish early and sit\naround telling stories. I hovered silently and listened. They spoke in an idiom that I\u2019d never heard before. Their speech was formal and lofty, their\nmanner slow and unhurried, and the traditional clicks of our language were long and dramatic.\nAt first, they shooed me away and told me I was too young to listen. Later they would beckon me to fetch fire or water for them, or to tell the\nwomen they wanted tea, and in those early months I was too busy running errands to follow their conversation. But, eventually, they permitted me to\nstay, and I discovered the great African patriots who fought against Western domination. My imagination was fired by the glory of these African\nwarriors.\nThe most ancient of the chiefs who regaled the gathered elders with ancient tales was Zwelibhangile Joyi, a son from the Great House of King\nNgubengcuka. Chief Joyi was so old that his wrinkled skin hung on him like a loose-fitting coat. His stories unfolded slowly and were often\npunctuated by a great wheezing cough, which would force him to stop for minutes at a time. Chief Joyi was the great authority on the history of the\nThembus in large part because he had lived through so much of it.\nBut as grizzled as Chief Joyi often seemed, the decades fell off him when he spoke of the young impis, or warriors, in the army of King\nNgangelizwe fighting the British. In pantomime, Chief Joyi would fling his spear and creep along the veld as he narrated the victories and defeats.\nHe spoke of Ngangelizwe\u2019s heroism, generosity, and humility.\nNot all of Chief Joyi\u2019s stories revolved around the Thembus. When he first spoke of non-Xhosa warriors, I wondered why. I was like a boy who\nworships a local soccer hero and is not interested in a national soccer star with whom he has no connection. Only later was I moved by the broad\nsweep of African history, and the deeds of all African heroes regardless of tribe.\nChief Joyi railed against the white man, who he believed had deliberately sundered the Xhosa tribe, dividing brother from brother. The white man\nhad told the Thembus that their true chief was the great white queen across the ocean and that they were her subjects. But the white queen brought\nnothing but misery and perfidy to the black people, and if she was a chief she was an evil chief. Chief Joyi\u2019s war stories and his indictment of the\nBritish made me feel angry and cheated, as though I had already been robbed of my own birthright.\nChief Joyi said that the African people lived in relative peace until the coming of the abelungu, the white people, who arrived from across the sea\nwith fire-breathing weapons. Once, he said, the Thembu, the Mpondo, the Xhosa, and the Zulu were all children of one father, and lived as brothers.\nThe white man shattered the abantu, the fellowship, of the various tribes. The white man was hungry and greedy for land, and the black man shared\nthe land with him as they shared the air and water; land was not for man to possess. But the white man took the land as you might seize another\nman\u2019s horse.\nI did not yet know that the real history of our country was not to be found in standard British textbooks, which claimed South Africa began with the\nlanding of Jan Van Riebeeck at the Cape of Good Hope in . It was from Chief Joyi that I began to discover that the history of the Bantuspeaking peoples began far to the north, in a country of lakes and green plains and valleys, and that slowly over the millennia we made our way\ndown to the very tip of this great continent. However, I later discovered that Chief Joyi\u2019s account of African history, particularly after , was not\nalways so accurate.\n\nIn Mqhekezweni, I felt not unlike the proverbial country boy who comes to the big city. Mqhekezweni was far more sophisticated than Qunu, whose\nresidents were regarded as backward by the people of Mqhekezweni. The regent was loath to have me visit Qunu, thinking I would regress and fall\ninto bad company back in my old village. When I did visit, I sensed that my mother had been briefed by the regent, for she would question me\nclosely as to whom I was playing with. On many occasions, however, the regent would arrange for my mother and sisters to be brought to the Great\nPlace.\nWhen I first arrived in Mqhekezweni I was regarded by some of my peers as a yokel who was hopelessly unequipped to exist in the rarefied\natmosphere of the Great Place. As young men will, I did my best to appear suave and sophisticated. In church one day, I had noticed a lovely young\nwoman who was one of the daughters of the Reverend Matyolo. Her name was Winnie, and I asked her out and she accepted. She was keen on\n\n\fme, but her eldest sister, nomaMpondo, regarded me as hopelessly backward. She told her sister that I was a barbarian who was not good enough\nfor the daughter of Reverend Matyolo. To prove to her younger sister how uncivilized I was, she invited me to the rectory for lunch. I was still used to\neating at home, where we did not use knife and fork. At the family table, this mischievous older sister handed me a plate that contained a single\nchicken wing. But the wing, instead of being soft and tender, was a bit tough, so the meat did not fall easily off the bone.\nI watched the others using their knives and forks with ease and slowly picked up mine. I observed the others for a few moments, and then\nattempted to carve my little wing. At first I just moved it around the plate, hoping that the flesh would fall from the bone. Then I tried in vain to pin the\nthing down, and cut it, but it eluded me, and in my frustration I was clanking my knife on the plate. I tried this repeatedly and then noticed that the\nolder sister was smiling at me and looking knowingly at the younger sister as if to say, \u201cI told you so.\u201d I struggled and struggled and became wet with\nperspiration, but I did not want to admit defeat and pick the infernal thing up with my hands. I did not eat much chicken that day at luncheon.\nAfterward the older sister told the younger, \u201cYou will waste your whole life if you fall in love with such a backward boy,\u201d but I am happy to say the\nyoung lady did not listen \u2014 she loved me, as backward as I was. Eventually, of course, we went different ways and drifted apart. She attended a\ndifferent school, and qualified as a teacher. We corresponded for a few years and then I lost track of her, but by that time I had considerably\nimproved my table etiquette.\n WHEN I RECEIVED my banning, the Transvaal conference of the ANC was due to be held the following month, and I had already completed the\ndraft of my presidential address. It was read to the conference by Andrew Kunene, a member of the executive. In that speech, which subsequently\nbecame known as \u201cThe No Easy Walk to Freedom\u201d speech, a line taken from Jawaharlal Nehru, I said that the masses now had to be prepared for\nnew forms of political struggle. The new laws and tactics of the government had made the old forms of mass protest \u2014 public meetings, press\nstatements, stay-aways \u2014 extremely dangerous and self-destructive. Newspapers would not publish our statements; printing presses refused to\nprint our leaflets, all for fear of prosecution under the Suppression of Communism Act. \u201cThese developments,\u201d I wrote, \u201crequire the evolution of new\nforms of political struggle. The old methods,\u201d I said, were now \u201csuicidal.\u201d\n\u201cThe oppressed people and the oppressors are at loggerheads. The day of reckoning between the forces of freedom and those of reaction is not\nvery far off. I have not the slightest doubt that when that day comes truth and justice will prevail. . . . The feelings of the oppressed people have never\nbeen more bitter. The grave plight of the people compels them to resist to the death the stinking policies of the gangsters that rule our country. . . .\nTo overthrow oppression has been sanctioned by humanity and is the highest aspiration of every free man.\u201d\n\nIn April of , the Law Society of the Transvaal applied to the Supreme Court for my name to be struck off the roll of accredited attorneys on the\nground that the political activities for which I was convicted in the Defiance case amounted to unprofessional and dishonorable conduct. This\noccurred at a time when Mandela and Tambo was flourishing and I was in court dozens of times a week.\nThe documents were served at my office, and as soon as the application against me had been made and publicized, I began to receive offers of\nsupport and help. I even received offers of help from a number of well-known Afrikaner lawyers. Many of these men were supporters of the National\nParty, but they believed that the application was biased and unfair. Their response suggested to me that even in racist South Africa professional\nsolidarity can sometimes transcend color, and that there were still attorneys and judges who refused to be the rubber stamps of an immoral regime.\nMy case was ably defended by advocate Walter Pollak, Q.C., chairman of the Johannesburg Bar Council. At the time that I retained Walter\nPollak, I was advised that I should also retain someone who was not connected with the struggle, as that would positively influence the Transvaal\nbar. To that end, we retained William Aronsohn, as instructing attorney or barrister, who was head of one of the oldest law firms in Johannesburg.\nBoth men acted for me without charge. We argued that the application was an affront to the idea of justice and that I had an inherent right to fight for\nmy political beliefs, which was the right of all men in a state where the rule of law applied.\nBut the argument that had great weight was Pollak\u2019s use of the case of a man called Strijdom, who was detained during the Second World War\ntogether with B. J. Vorster (who later became prime minister). Both were interned for their pro-Nazi stance. Following a failed escape attempt,\nStrijdom had been found guilty of car theft. Later, after he was released, he applied to the bar for admission as an advocate. Despite his crimes\nand strong objections from the Bar Council, the court decided to admit him on the ground that his offense was political and that a man cannot be\nbarred from practicing as an advocate for his political beliefs. Pollak said, \u201cThere are of course differences between Strijdom and Mandela.\nMandela is not a Nationalist and Mandela is not a white.\u201d\nJudge Ramsbottom, who heard the case, was an example of a judge who refused to be a mouthpiece for the Nationalists and upheld the\nindependence of the judiciary. His judgment in the case completely upheld our claim that I had a right to campaign for my political beliefs even\nthough they were opposed to the government, and he dismissed the Law Society\u2019s application. And in a rare instance the Law Society was\nordered to pay its own costs. SITUATED FOUR MILES WEST of Johannesburg\u2019s center, on the face of a rocky outcrop overlooking the city, was the African township of\nSophiatown. Father Trevor Huddleston, one of the township\u2019s greatest friends, once compared Sophiatown to an Italian hill town and from a\ndistance the place did indeed have a good deal of charm: the closely packed, red-roofed houses; the smoke curling up into a pink sky; the tall and\nslender gum trees that hugged the township. Up close one saw the poverty and squalor in which too many of Sophiatown\u2019s people lived. The streets\nwere narrow and unpaved, and every lot was filled with dozens of shanties huddled close together.\nSophiatown was part of what was known as the Western Areas townships, along with Martindale and Newclare. The area was originally intended\nfor whites, and a real estate developer actually built a number of houses there for white buyers. But because of a municipal refuse dump in the area,\nwhites chose to live elsewhere. Reluctantly, the developer sold his houses to Africans. Sophiatown was one of the few places in the Transvaal\nwhere Africans had been able to buy stands, or plots, prior to the  Urban Areas Act. Many of these old brick and stone houses, with their tinroofed verandas, still stood in Sophiatown, giving the township an air of Old World graciousness. As industry in Johannesburg grew, Sophiatown\nbecame the home of a rapidly expanding African workforce. It was convenient and close to town. Workers lived in shanties that were erected in the\nback and front yards of older residences. Several families might all be crowded into a single shanty. Up to forty people could share a single water\ntap. Despite the poverty, Sophiatown had a special character; for Africans, it was the Left Bank in Paris, Greenwich Village in New York, the home\nof writers, artists, doctors, and lawyers. It was both bohemian and conventional, lively and sedate. It was home to both Dr. Xuma, where he had his\npractice, and assorted tsotsis (gangsters), like the Berliners and the Americans, who adopted the names of American movie stars like John Wayne\nand Humphrey Bogart. Sophiatown boasted the only swimming pool for African children in Johannesburg.\n\nIn Johannesburg, the Western Areas Removal scheme meant the evacuation of Sophiatown, Martindale, and Newclare, with a collective population\nthat was somewhere between , and ,. In , the Nationalist government had purchased a tract of land called Meadowlands,\nthirteen miles from the city. People were to be resettled there in seven different \u201cethnic groups.\u201d The excuse given by the government was slum\nclearance, a smoke screen for the government policy that regarded all urban areas as white areas where Africans were temporary residents.\nThe government was under pressure from its supporters in the surrounding areas of Westdene and Newlands, which were comparatively poor\nwhite areas. These working-class whites were envious of some of the fine houses owned by blacks in Sophiatown. The government wanted to\ncontrol the movements of all Africans, and such control was far more difficult in freehold urban townships, where blacks could own property, and\npeople came and went as they pleased. Though the pass system was still in effect, one did not need a special permit to enter a freehold township\nas was the case with municipal locations. Africans had lived and owned property in Sophiatown for over fifty years; now the government was\ncallously planning on relocating all Sophiatown\u2019s African residents to another black township. So cynical was the government\u2019s plan that the\nremoval was to take place even before the houses were built to accommodate the evacuated people. The removal of Sophiatown was the first\nmajor test of strength for the ANC and its allies after the Defiance Campaign.\nAlthough the government\u2019s removal campaign for Sophiatown had started in , efforts by the ANC to combat it did not begin in earnest until\n. By the middle of the year, the local branches of the ANC and the TIC and the local Ratepayers Association were mobilizing people to resist.\nIn June of , a public meeting was called by the provincial executive of the ANC and the TIC at Sophiatown\u2019s Odin cinema to discuss\nopposition to the removal. It was a lively, exuberant meeting attended by more than twelve hundred people, none of whom seemed intimidated by\nthe presence of dozens of heavily armed policemen.\nOnly a few days before the meeting, my banning orders, as well as Walter\u2019s, had expired. This meant that we were no longer prevented from\nattending or speaking at gatherings, and arrangements were quickly made for me to speak at the theater.\nShortly before the meeting was to begin, a police officer saw Walter and me outside the cinema talking with Father Huddleston, one of the\nleaders of the opposition to the removal. The officer informed the two of us that as banned individuals we had no right to be there, and he then\nordered his officers to arrest us. Father Huddleston shouted to the policemen coming toward us, \u201cNo, you must arrest me instead, my dears.\u201d The\nofficer ordered Father Huddleston to stand aside, but he refused. As the policemen moved Father Huddleston out of the way, I said to the officer,\n\u201cYou must make sure if we are under a ban or not. Be careful, because it would be a wrongful arrest to take us in if our bans have expired. Now, do\nyou think we would be here tonight talking to you if our bans had not expired?\u201d\nThe police were notorious for keeping very poor records and were often unaware when bans ended. The officer knew this as well as I did. He\npondered what I had said, then told his officers to pull back. They stood aside as we entered the hall.\nInside, the police were provocative and contemptuous. Equipped with pistols and rifles, they strutted around the hall pushing people around,\nmaking insulting remarks. I was sitting onstage with a number of other leaders, and as the meeting was about to begin, I saw Major Prinsloo come\nswaggering in through the stage door, accompanied by a number of armed officers. I caught his eye, and I made a gesture as if to say, \u201cMe?\u201d and\nhe shook his head no. He then walked over to the podium, where Yusuf Cachalia had already begun to speak, and ordered the other officers to\narrest him, whereupon they took him by the arms and started to drag him off. Outside, the police had already arrested Robert Resha and Ahmed\nKathrada.\nThe crowd began yelling and booing, and I saw that matters could turn extremely ugly if the crowd did not control itself. I jumped to the podium and\nstarted singing a well-known protest song, and as soon as I pronounced the first few words the crowd joined in. I feared that the police might have\nopened fire if the crowd had become too unruly.\n\nThe ANC was then holding meetings every Sunday evening in Freedom Square, in the center of Sophiatown, to mobilize opposition to the removal.\nThese were vibrant sessions, punctuated by repeated cries of \u201cAsihambi!\u201d (We are not moving!) and the singing of \u201cSophiatown likhaya lam\nasihambi\u201d (Sophiatown is my home; we are not moving). The meetings were addressed by leading ANC members, standholders, tenants, city\ncouncillors, and often by Father Huddleston, who ignored police warnings to confine himself to church affairs.\nOne Sunday evening, not long after the incident at the Odin, I was scheduled to speak in Freedom Square. The crowd that night was passionate,\nand their emotion undoubtedly influenced mine. There were a great many young people present, and they were angry and eager for action. As\nusual, policemen were clustered around the perimeter, armed with both guns and pencils, the latter to take notes as to who was speaking and what\nthe speaker was saying. We tried to make this into a virtue by being as open with the police as possible to show them that in fact we had nothing to\nhide, not even our distaste for them.\n\n\fI began by speaking about the increasing repressiveness of the government in the wake of the Defiance Campaign. I said the government was\nnow scared of the might of the African people. As I spoke, I grew more and more indignant. In those days, I was something of a rabble-rousing\nspeaker. I liked to incite an audience, and I was doing so that evening.\nAs I condemned the government for its ruthlessness and lawlessness, I stepped across the line: I said that the time for passive resistance had\nended, that nonviolence was a useless strategy and could never overturn a white minority regime bent on retaining its power at any cost. At the end\nof the day, I said, violence was the only weapon that would destroy apartheid and we must be prepared, in the near future, to use that weapon.\nThe crowd was excited; the youth in particular were clapping and cheering. They were ready to act on what I said right then and there. At that\npoint I began to sing a freedom song, the lyrics of which say, \u201cThere are the enemies, let us take our weapons and attack them.\u201d I sang this song\nand the crowd joined in, and when the song was finished, I pointed to the police and said, \u201cThere, there are our enemies!\u201d The crowd again started\ncheering and made aggressive gestures in the direction of the police. The police looked nervous, and a number of them pointed back at me as if to\nsay, \u201cMandela, we will get you for this.\u201d I did not mind. In the heat of the moment I did not think of the consequences.\nBut my words that night did not come out of nowhere. I had been thinking of the future. The government was busily taking measures to prevent\nanything like the Defiance Campaign from reoccurring. I had begun to analyze the struggle in different terms. The ambition of the ANC was to wage\na mass struggle, to engage the workers and peasants of South Africa in a campaign so large and powerful that it might overcome the status quo of\nwhite oppression. But the Nationalist government was making any legal expression of dissent or protest impossible. I saw that they would ruthlessly\nsuppress any legitimate protest on the part of the African majority. A police state did not seem far off.\nI began to suspect that both legal and extra-constitutional protests would soon be impossible. In India, Gandhi had been dealing with a foreign\npower that ultimately was more realistic and farsighted. That was not the case with the Afrikaners in South Africa. Nonviolent passive resistance is\neffective as long as your opposition adheres to the same rules as you do. But if peaceful protest is met with violence, its efficacy is at an end. For\nme, nonviolence was not a moral principle but a strategy; there is no moral goodness in using an ineffective weapon. But my thoughts on this matter\nwere not yet formed, and I had spoken too soon.\nThat was certainly the view of the National Executive Committee. When they learned of my speech, I was severely reprimanded for advocating\nsuch a radical departure from accepted policy. Although some on the executive sympathized with my remarks, no one could support the\nintemperate way that I had made them. The executive admonished me, noting that the impulsive policy I had called for was not only premature but\ndangerous. Such speeches could provoke the enemy to crush the organization entirely while the enemy was strong and we were as yet still weak. I\naccepted the censure, and thereafter faithfully defended the policy of nonviolence in public. But in my heart, I knew that nonviolence was not the\nanswer.\nIn those days, I was often in hot water with the executive. In early , Chief Luthuli, Z. K. Matthews, and a handful of other high-ranking ANC\nleaders were invited to a meeting with a group of whites who were in the process of forming the Liberal Party. A meeting of the ANC executive took\nplace afterward at which a few of us asked for a report of the earlier meeting with the white liberals. The attendees refused, saying that they had\nbeen invited in their private capacity, not as members of the ANC. We continued to pester them, and finally Professor Matthews, who was a lawyer,\nsaid that it had been a privileged conversation. In a fit of indignation, I said, \u201cWhat kind of leaders are you who can discuss matters with a group of\nwhite liberals and then not share that information with your colleagues at the ANC? That\u2019s the trouble with you, you are scared and overawed of the\nwhite man. You value his company more than that of your African comrades.\u201d\nThis outburst provoked the wrath of both Professor Matthews and Chief Luthuli. First, Professor Matthews responded: \u201cMandela, what do you\nknow about whites? I taught you whatever you know about whites and you are still ignorant. Even now, you are barely out of your student uniform.\u201d\nLuthuli was burning with a cold fire and said, \u201cAll right, if you are accusing me of being afraid of the white man then I have no other recourse but to\nresign. If that is what you say then that is what I intend to do.\u201d I did not know whether Luthuli was bluffing or not, but his threat frightened me. I had\nspoken hastily, without thinking, without a sense of responsibility, and I now greatly regretted it. I immediately withdrew my charge and apologized. I\nwas a young man who attempted to make up for his ignorance with militancy.\n\nAt the same time as my speech in Sophiatown, Walter informed me that he had been invited to attend the World Festival of Youth and Students for\nPeace and Friendship in Bucharest as a guest of honor. The timing of the invitation gave Walter virtually no opportunity to consult with the National\nExecutive Committee. I was keen that he should go and encouraged him to do so, whether or not he conferred with the executive. Walter resolved\nto go and I helped him arrange for a substitute passport, an affidavit stating his identity and citizenship. (The government would never have issued\nhim a proper passport.) The group, which was headed by Walter Sisulu and Duma Nokwe, traveled on the only airline that would accept such an\naffidavit: the Israeli airline, El Al.\nI was convinced, despite my reprimand from the executive, that the policies of the Nationalists would soon make nonviolence an even more\nlimited and ineffective policy. Walter was privy to my thoughts and before he left, I made a suggestion: he should arrange to visit the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China and discuss with them the possibility of supplying us with weapons for an armed struggle. Walter liked the idea and promised to\nmake the attempt.\nThis action was taken purely on my own and my methods were highly unorthodox. To some extent, they were the actions of a hotheaded\nrevolutionary who had not thought things through and who acted without discipline. They were the actions of a man frustrated with the immorality of\napartheid and the ruthlessness of the state in protecting it.\nWalter\u2019s visit caused a storm within the executive. I undertook the task of personally conveying his apologies. I did not mention my secret request.\nLuthuli objected to the flouting of the ANC\u2019s code of conduct, and Professor Matthews expressed dismay about Walter visiting socialist countries.\nThe executive was skeptical about Walter\u2019s motives, and questioned my explanation of the circumstances. A few wanted to formally censure Walter\nand me, but in the end did not.\nWalter managed to reach China, where the leadership received him warmly. They conveyed their support of our struggle, but they were wary and\ncautious when he broached the idea of an armed struggle. They warned him that an armed struggle was an extremely grave undertaking and they\nquestioned whether the liberation movement had matured sufficiently to justify such an endeavor. Walter came back with encouragement but no\nguns. IN JOHANNESBURG, I had become a man of the city. I wore smart suits; I drove a colossal Oldsmobile, and I knew my way around the back alleys\nof the city. I commuted daily to a downtown office. But in fact I remained a country boy at heart, and there was nothing that lifted my spirits as much\nas blue skies, the open veld, and green grass. In September, with my bans ended, I decided to take advantage of my freedom and get a respite\nfrom the city. I took on a case in the little dorp of Villiers in the Orange Free State.\nThe drive to the Orange Free State from Johannesburg used to take several hours, and I set out on my journey from Orlando at  A.M., which has\nalways been my favorite hour for departure. I am an early riser anyway, and at  A.M. the roads are empty and quiet, and one can be alone with one\u2019s\nthoughts. I like to see the coming of dawn, the change between night and day, which is always majestic. It was also a convenient hour for departure\nbecause the police were usually nowhere to be found.\nThe province of the Orange Free State has always had a magical effect on me, though some of the most racist elements of the white population\ncall the Free State their home. With its flat dusty landscape as far as the eye can see, the great blue ceiling above, the endless stretches of yellow\nmealie fields, scrub and bushes, the Free State\u2019s landscape gladdens my heart no matter what my mood. When I am there I feel like nothing can\nshut me in, that my thoughts can roam as far and wide as the horizons.\nThe landscape bore the imprint of General Christiaan De Wet, the gifted Boer commander who outclassed the British in dozens of engagements\nduring the final months of the Anglo-Boer War; fearless, proud, and shrewd, he would have been one of my heroes had he been fighting for the\nrights of all South Africans, not just Afrikaners. He demonstrated the courage and resourcefulness of the underdog, and the power of a less\nsophisticated but patriotic army against a tested war machine. As I drove, I imagined the hiding places of General De Wet\u2019s army and wondered\nwhether they would someday shelter African rebels.\nThe drive to Villiers cheered me considerably, and I was laboring under a false sense of security when I entered the small courthouse on the\nmorning of the third of September. I found a group of policemen waiting for me. With nary a word, they served me with an order under the\nSuppression of Communism Act requiring me to resign from the ANC, restricting me to the Johannesburg district, and prohibiting me from\nattending any meetings or gatherings for two years. I knew such measures would come, but I had not expected to receive my bans in the remote\ntown of Villiers.\nI was thirty-five years old and these new and more severe bans ended a period of nearly a decade of involvement with the ANC, years that had\nbeen the time of my political awakening and growth, and my gradual commitment to the struggle that had become my life. Henceforth, all of my\nactions and plans on behalf of the ANC and the liberation struggle would become secret and illegal. Once served, I had to return to Johannesburg\nimmediately.\nMy bans drove me from the center of the struggle to the sidelines, from a role that was primary to one that was peripheral. Though I was often\nconsulted and was able to influence the direction of events, I did so at a distance and only when expressly asked. I no longer felt like a vital organ of\nthe body \u2014 the heart, lungs, or backbone \u2014 but a severed limb. Even freedom fighters, at least then, had to obey the laws, and at that point,\nimprisonment for violating my bans would have been useless to the ANC and to myself. We were not yet at the point where we were open\nrevolutionaries, overtly fighting the system no matter what the cost. We believed then that it was better to organize underground than to go to prison.\nWhen I was forced to resign from the ANC, the organization had to replace me, and no matter what I might have liked, I could no longer wield the\nauthority I once possessed. While I was driving back to Johannesburg, the Free State scenery did not have quite the same elevating effect on me\nas before. THE ANTIREMOVAL CAMPAIGN in Sophiatown was a long-running battle. We held our ground, as did the state. Through  and into ,\nrallies were held twice a week, on Wednesday and Sunday evenings. Speaker after speaker continued to decry the government\u2019s plans. The ANC\nand the Ratepayers Association, under the direction of Dr. Xuma, protested to the government in letters and petitions. We ran the antiremoval\ncampaign on the slogan \u201cOver Our Dead Bodies,\u201d a motto often shouted from the platforms and echoed by the audience. One night, it even roused\nthe otherwise cautious Dr. Xuma to utter the electrifying slogan used to rally African warriors to battle in the previous century: \u201cZemk\u2019 inkomo\nmagwalandini!\u201d (The enemy has captured the cattle, you cowards!)\nThe government had scheduled the removal for February , . As the day approached, Oliver and I were in the township daily, meeting local\nleaders, discussing plans, and acting in our professional capacity for those being forced out of the area or prosecuted. We sought to prove to the\ncourt that the government\u2019s documentation was often incorrect and that many orders to leave were therefore illegal. But this was only a temporary\nmeasure; the government would not let a few illegalities stand in their way.\nShortly before the scheduled removal, a special mass meeting was planned for Freedom Square. Ten thousand people gathered to hear Chief\nLuthuli speak. But upon his arrival in Johannesburg, he was served with a banning order forcing him to return to Natal.\n\nThe night before the removal, Joe Modise, one of the most dedicated of the local ANC leaders, addressed a tense meeting of more than five\nhundred youthful activists. They expected the ANC to give them an order to battle the police and the army. They were prepared to erect barricades\novernight and engage the police with weapons and whatever came to hand the next day. They assumed our slogan meant what it said: that\nSophiatown would be removed only over our dead bodies.\nBut after discussions with the ANC leadership, including myself, Joe told the youth to stand down. They were angry and felt betrayed. But we\nbelieved that violence would have been a disaster. We pointed out that an insurrection required careful planning or it would become an act of\nsuicide. We were not yet ready to engage the enemy on its own terms.\nIn the hazy dawn hours of February , four thousand police and army troops cordoned off the township while workers razed empty houses and\ngovernment trucks began moving families from Sophiatown to Meadowlands. The night before, the ANC had evacuated several families to\nprearranged accommodation with pro-ANC families in the interior of Sophiatown. But our efforts were too little and too late, and could only be a\nstopgap measure. The army and the police were relentlessly efficient. After a few weeks, our resistance collapsed. Most of our local leaders had\nbeen banned or arrested, and in the end, Sophiatown died not to the sound of gunfire but to the sound of rumbling trucks and sledgehammers.\nOne can always be correct about a political action one is reading about in the next day\u2019s newspaper, but when you are in the center of a heated\npolitical fight, you are given little time for reflection. We made a variety of mistakes in the Western Areas antiremoval campaign and learned a\nnumber of lessons. \u201cOver Our Dead Bodies\u201d was a dynamic slogan, but it proved as much a hindrance as a help. A slogan is a vital link between\nthe organization and the masses it seeks to lead. It should synthesize a particular grievance into a succinct and pithy phrase, while mobilizing the\npeople to combat it. Our slogan caught the imagination of the people, but it led them to believe that we would fight to the death to resist the removal.\nIn fact, the ANC was not prepared to do that at all.\nWe never provided the people with an alternative to moving to Meadowlands. When the people in Sophiatown realized we could neither stop the\ngovernment nor provide them with housing elsewhere, their own resistance waned and the flow of people to Meadowlands increased. Many tenants\nmoved willingly, for they found they would have more space and cleaner housing in Meadowlands. We did not take into account the different\nsituations of landlords and tenants. While the landlords had reasons to stay, many tenants had an incentive to leave. The ANC was criticized by a\nnumber of Africanist members who accused the leadership of protecting the interests of the landlords at the expense of the tenants.\nThe lesson I took away from the campaign was that in the end, we had no alternative to armed and violent resistance. Over and over again, we\nhad used all the nonviolent weapons in our arsenal \u2014 speeches, deputations, threats, marches, strikes, stay-aways, voluntary imprisonment \u2014 all\nto no avail, for whatever we did was met by an iron hand. A freedom fighter learns the hard way that it is the oppressor who defines the nature of the\nstruggle, and the oppressed is often left no recourse but to use methods that mirror those of the oppressor. At a certain point, one can only fight fire\nwith fire.\n\nEducation is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of\na mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farmworkers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of\nwhat we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another.\nSince the turn of the century, Africans owed their educational opportunites primarily to the foreign churches and missions that created and\nsponsored schools. Under the United Party, the syllabus for African secondary schools and white secondary schools was essentially the same. The\nmission schools provided Africans with Western-style English-language education, which I myself received. We were limited by lesser facilities but\nnot by what we could read or think or dream.\nYet, even before the Nationalists came to power, the disparities in funding tell a story of racist education. The government spent about six times\nas much per white student as per African student. Education was not compulsory for Africans and was free only in the primary grades. Less than\nhalf of all African children of school age attended any school at all, and only a tiny number of Africans were graduated from high school.\nEven this amount of education proved distasteful to the Nationalists. The Afrikaner has always been unenthusiastic about education for Africans.\nTo him it was simply a waste, for the African was inherently ignorant and lazy and no amount of education could remedy that. The Afrikaner was\ntraditionally hostile to Africans learning English, for English was a foreign tongue to the Afrikaner and the language of emancipation to us.\nIn , the Nationalist-dominated Parliament passed the Bantu Education Act, which sought to put apartheid\u2019s stamp on African education. The\nact transferred control of African education from the Department of Education to the much loathed Native Affairs Department. Under the act, African\nprimary and secondary schools operated by the church and mission bodies were given the choice of turning over their schools to the government or\nreceiving gradually diminished subsidies; either the government took over education for Africans or there would be no education for Africans.\nAfrican teachers were not permitted to criticize the government or any school authority. It was intellectual \u201cbaasskap,\u201d a way of institutionalizing\ninferiority.\nDr. Hendrik Verwoerd, the minister of Bantu education, explained that education \u201cmust train and teach people in accordance with their\nopportunities in life.\u201d His meaning was that Africans did not and would not have any opportunities, therefore, why educate them? \u201cThere is no place\n\n\ffor the Bantu in the European community above the level of certain forms of labor,\u201d he said. In short, Africans should be trained to be menial\nworkers, to be in a position of perpetual subordination to the white man.\nTo the ANC, the act was a deeply sinister measure designed to retard the progress of African culture as a whole and, if enacted, permanently set\nback the freedom struggle of the African people. The mental outlook of all future generations of Africans was at stake. As Professor Matthews\nwrote at the time, \u201cEducation for ignorance and for inferiority in Verwoerd\u2019s schools is worse than no education at all.\u201d\nThe act and Verwoerd\u2019s crude exposition of it aroused widespread indignation from both black and white. With the exception of the Dutch\nReform Church, which supported apartheid, and the Lutheran mission, all Christian churches opposed the new measure. But the unity of the\nopposition extended only to condemning the policy, not resisting it. The Anglicans, the most fearless and consistent critics of the new policy, had a\ndivided policy. Bishop Ambrose Reeves of Johannesburg took the extreme step of closing his schools, which had a total enrollment of ten thousand\nchildren. But the archbishop of the church in South Africa, anxious to keep children out of the streets, handed over the rest of the schools to the\ngovernment. Despite their protests, all the other churches did the same with the exception of the Roman Catholics, the Seventh-Day Adventists,\nand the United Jewish Reform Congregation \u2014 who soldiered on without state aid. Even my own church, the Wesleyan Church, handed over their\ntwo hundred thousand African students to the government. If all the other churches had followed the example of those who resisted, the government\nwould have been confronted with a stalemate that might have forced a compromise. Instead, the state marched over us.\n\nThe transfer of control to the Native Affairs Department was set to take place on April , , and the ANC began to discuss plans for a school\nboycott that would begin on that date. Our secret discussions among the executive turned on whether we should call on the people to stage a\nprotest for a limited period or whether we should proclaim a permanent school boycott to destroy the Bantu Education Act before it could take root.\nThe discussions were fierce and both sides had forceful advocates. The argument for an indefinite boycott was that Bantu Education was a poison\none could not drink even at the point of death from thirst. To accept it in any form would cause irreparable damage. They argued that the country\nwas in an explosive mood and the people were hungry for something more spectacular than a mere protest.\nAlthough I had the reputation of being a firebrand, I always felt that the organization should never promise to do more than it was able, for the\npeople would then lose confidence in it. I took the stance that our actions should be based not on idealistic considerations but on practical ones. An\nindefinite boycott would require massive machinery and vast resources that we did not possess, and our past campaigns showed no indication that\nwe were up to such an undertaking. It was simply impossible for us to create our own schools fast enough to accommodate hundreds of thousands\nof pupils, and if we did not offer our people an alternative, we were offering next to nothing. Along with others, I urged a week\u2019s boycott.\nThe National Executive Committee resolved that a weeklong school boycott should begin on April . This was recommended at the annual\nconference in Durban in December of , but the delegates rejected the recommendation and voted for an indefinite boycott. The conference\nwas the supreme authority, even greater than the executive, and we found ourselves saddled with a boycott that would be almost impossible to\neffect. Dr. Verwoerd announced that the government would permanently close all schools that were boycotted and that children who stayed away\nwould not be readmitted.\n\nFor this boycott to work, the parents and the community would have to step in and take the place of the schools. I spoke to parents and ANC\nmembers and told them that every home, every shack, every community structure, must become a center of learning for our children.\nThe boycott began on April  and had mixed results. It was often sporadic, disorganized, and ineffectual. On the east Rand it affected some\nseven thousand schoolchildren. Predawn marches called on parents to keep their children at home. Women picketed the schools and plucked out\nchildren who had wandered into them.\nIn Germiston, a township southeast of the city, Joshua Makue, chairman of our local branch, ran a school for eight hundred boycotting children\nthat lasted for three years. In Port Elizabeth, Barrett Tyesi gave up a government teaching post and ran a school for boycotting children. In , he\npresented seventy of these children for the Standard VI exams; all but three passed. In many places, improvised schools (described as \u201ccultural\nclubs\u201d in order not to attract the attention of the authorities) taught boycotting students. The government subsequently passed a law that made it an\noffense punishable by fine or imprisonment to offer unauthorized education. Police harassed these clubs, but many continued to exist underground.\nIn the end, the community schools withered away and parents, faced with a choice between inferior education and no education at all, chose the\nformer. My own children were at the Seventh-Day Adventist school, which was private and did not depend on government subsidies.\nThe campaign should be judged on two levels: whether the immediate objective was achieved, and whether it politicized more people and drew\nthem into the struggle. On the first level, the campaign clearly failed. We did not close down African schools throughout the country nor did we rid\nourselves of the Bantu Education Act. But the government was sufficiently rattled by our protest to modify the act, and at one point Verwoerd was\ncompelled to declare that education should be the same for all. The government\u2019s November  draft syllabus was a retreat from the original\nnotion of modeling the school system on tribal foundations. In the end, we had no option but to choose between the lesser of two evils, and opt for a\ndiminished education. But the consequences of Bantu Education came back to haunt the government in unforeseen ways. For it was Bantu\nEducation that produced in the s the angriest, most rebellious generation of black youth the country had ever seen. When these children of\nBantu Education entered their late teens and early twenties, they rose up with a vehemence.\n\nSeveral months after Chief Luthuli was elected president of the ANC, Professor Z. K. Matthews returned to South Africa after a year as a visiting\nprofessor in the U.S., armed with an idea that would reshape the liberation struggle. In a speech at the ANC annual conference in the Cape,\nProfessor Matthews said, \u201cI wonder whether the time has not come for the African National Congress to consider the question of convening a\nnational convention, a congress of the people, representing all the people of this country irrespective of race or colour, to draw up a Freedom\nCharter for the democratic South Africa of the future.\u201d\nWithin months the ANC national conference accepted the proposal, and a Council of the Congress of the People was created, with Chief Luthuli\nas chairman and Walter Sisulu and Yusuf Cachalia as joint secretaries. The Congress of the People was to create a set of principles for the\nfoundation of a new South Africa. Suggestions for a new constitution were to come from the people themselves, and ANC leaders all across the\ncountry were authorized to seek ideas in writing from everyone in their area. The charter would be a document born of the people.\nThe Congress of the People represented one of the two main currents of thought operating within the organization. It seemed inevitable that the\ngovernment would ban the ANC, and many argued that the organization must be prepared to operate underground and illegally. At the same time,\nwe did not want to give up on the important public policies and activities that brought the ANC attention and mass support. The Congress of the\n\n\fPeople would be a public display of strength.\nOur dream for the Congress of the People was that it would be a landmark event in the history of the freedom struggle \u2014 a convention uniting all\nthe oppressed and all the progressive forces of South Africa to create a clarion call for change. Our hope was that it would one day be looked upon\nwith the same reverence as the founding convention of the ANC in .\nWe sought to attract the widest possible sponsorship and invited some two hundred organizations \u2014 white, black, Indian, and Coloured \u2014 to\nsend representatives to a planning conference at Tongaat, near Durban, in March of . The National Action Council created there was\ncomposed of eight members from each of the four sponsoring organizations. The chairman was Chief Luthuli, and the secretariat consisted of\nWalter Sisulu (later replaced by Oliver after Walter\u2019s banning forced him to resign), Yusuf Cachalia of the SAIC, Stanley Lollan of the South African\nColoured People\u2019s Organization (SACPO), and Lionel Bernstein of the Congress of Democrats (COD).\nFormed in Cape Town in September of  by Coloured leaders and trade unionists, SACPO was the belated offspring of the struggle to\npreserve the Coloured vote in the Cape and sought to represent Coloured interests. SACPO\u2019s founding conference was addressed by Oliver\nTambo and Yusuf Cachalia. Inspired by the Defiance Campaign, the COD was formed in late  as a party for radical, left-wing, antigovernment\nwhites. The COD, though small and limited mainly to Johannesburg and Cape Town, had an influence disproportionate to its numbers. Its\nmembers, such as Michael Harmel, Bram Fischer, and Rusty Bernstein, were eloquent advocates of our cause. The COD closely identified itself\nwith the ANC and the SAIC and advocated a universal franchise and full equality between black and white. We saw the COD as a means whereby\nour views could be put directly to the white public. The COD served an important symbolic function for Africans; blacks who had come into the\nstruggle because they were antiwhite discovered that there were indeed whites of goodwill who treated Africans as equals.\nThe National Action Council invited all participating organizations and their followers to send suggestions for a freedom charter. Circulars were\nsent out to townships and villages all across the country. \u201cIF YOU COULD MAKE THE LAWS . . . WHAT WOULD YOU DO?\u201d they said. \u201cHOW\nWOULD YOU SET ABOUT MAKING SOUTH AFRICA A HAPPY PLACE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN IT?\u201d Some of the flyers and\nleaflets were filled with the poetic idealism that characterized the planning:\nWE CALL THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH AFRICA BLACK AND WHITE \u2014 LET US SPEAK TOGETHER OF FREEDOM! . . . LET THE VOICES OF ALL THE PEOPLE BE HEARD. AND LET\nTHE DEMANDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE FOR THE THINGS THAT WILL MAKE US FREE BE RECORDED. LET THE DEMANDS BE GATHERED TOGETHER IN A GREAT CHARTER\nOF FREEDOM.\n\nThe call caught the imagination of the people. Suggestions came in from sports and cultural clubs, church groups, ratepayers\u2019 associations,\nwomen\u2019s organizations, schools, trade union branches. They came on serviettes, on paper torn from exercise books, on scraps of foolscap, on the\nbacks of our own leaflets. It was humbling to see how the suggestions of ordinary people were often far ahead of the leaders\u2019. The most commonly\ncited demand was for one-man-one-vote. There was a recognition that the country belongs to all those who have made it their home.\nThe ANC branches contributed a great deal to the process of writing the charter and in fact the two best drafts came from Durban and\nPietermaritzburg. A combination of these drafts was then circulated to different regions and committees for comments and questions. The charter\nitself was drafted by a small committee of the National Action Council and reviewed by the ANC\u2019s National Executive Committee.\nThe charter would be presented at the Congress of the People and each of its elements submitted to the delegates for approval. In June, a few\ndays before the congress was scheduled, a small group of us reviewed the draft. We made few changes, as there was little time and the document\nwas already in good shape.\n\nThe Congress of the People took place at Kliptown, a multiracial village on a scrap of veld a few miles southwest of Johannesburg, on two clear,\nsunny days, June  and , . More than three thousand delegates braved police intimidation to assemble and approve the final document.\nThey came by car, bus, truck, and foot. Although the overwhelming number of delegates were black, there were more than three hundred Indians,\ntwo hundred Coloureds, and one hundred whites.\nI drove to Kliptown with Walter. We were both under banning orders, so we found a place at the edge of the crowd where we could observe\nwithout mixing in or being seen. The crowd was impressive both in its size and in its discipline. \u201cFreedom volunteers\u201d wearing black, green, and\nyellow armbands met the delegates and arranged for their seating. There were old women and young wearing congress skirts, congress blouses,\ncongress doekies (scarves); old men and young wearing congress armbands and congress hats. Signs everywhere said, \u201cFREEDOM IN OUR\nLIFETIME, LONG LIVE THE STRUGGLE.\u201d The platform was a rainbow of colors: white delegates from the COD, Indians from the SAIC, Coloured\nrepresentatives from SACPO all sat in front of a replica of a four-spoked wheel representing the four organizations in the Congress Alliance. White\nand African police and members of the Special Branch milled around, taking photographs, writing in notebooks, and trying unsuccessfully to\nintimidate the delegates.\nThere were dozens of songs and speeches. Meals were served. The atmosphere was both serious and festive. On the afternoon of the first day,\nthe charter was read aloud, section by section, to the people in English, Sesotho, and Xhosa. After each section, the crowd shouted its approval\nwith cries of \u201cAfrika!\u201d and \u201cMayibuye!\u201d The first day of the congress was a success.\nThe second day was much like the first. Each section of the charter had been adopted by acclamation and at :, the final approval was to be\nvoted when a brigade of police and Special Branch detectives brandishing Sten guns swarmed onto the platform. In a gruff, Afrikaans-accented\nvoice, one of the police took the microphone and announced that treason was suspected and that no one was to leave the gathering without police\npermission. The police began pushing people off the platform and confiscating documents and photographs, even signs such as \u201cSOUP WITH MEAT\u201d\nand \u201cSOUP WITHOUT MEAT.\u201d Another group of constables armed with rifles formed a cordon around the crowd. The people responded magnificently by\nloudly singing \u201cNkosi Sikelel\u2019 iAfrika.\u201d The delegates were then allowed to leave one by one, each person interviewed by the police and his or her\nname taken down. I had been on the outskirts of the crowd when the police raid began, and while my instinct was to stay and help, discretion\nseemed the wiser course, because I would have immediately been arrested and tossed in jail. An emergency meeting had been called in\nJohannesburg and I made my way back there. As I returned to Johannesburg, I knew that this raid signaled a harsh new turn on the part of the\ngovernment.\n\nThough the Congress of the People had been broken up, the charter itself became a great beacon for the liberation struggle. Like other enduring\npolitical documents, such as the American Declaration of Independence, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man, and the Communist\nManifesto, the Freedom Charter is a mixture of practical goals and poetic language. It extols the abolition of racial discrimination and the\nachievement of equal rights for all. It welcomes all who embrace freedom to participate in the making of a democratic, nonracial South Africa. It\n\n\fcaptured the hopes and dreams of the people and acted as a blueprint for the liberation struggle and the future of the nation. The preamble reads:\nWe, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know: \u2014\nThat South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of the people;\nThat our people have been robbed of their birthright to land, liberty and peace by a form of government founded on injustice and inequality;\nThat our country will never be prosperous or free until all our people live in brotherhood, enjoying equal rights and opportunities;\nThat only a democratic state, based on the will of the people, can secure to all their birthright without distinction of colour, race, sex or belief;\nAnd therefore, we, the people of South Africa, black and white, together \u2014 equals, countrymen and brothers \u2014 adopt this FREEDOM CHARTER. And we pledge ourselves to\nstrive together, sparing nothing of our strength and courage, until the democratic changes here set out have been won.\n\nThe charter then lays out the requirements for a free and democratic South Africa.\nTHE PEOPLE SHALL GOVERN!\nEvery man and woman shall have the right to vote for and stand as a candidate for all bodies which make laws.\nAll the people shall be entitled to take part in the administration of the country.\nThe rights of the people shall be the same regardless of race, colour or sex.\nAll bodies of minority rule, advisory boards, councils and authorities shall be replaced by democratic organs of self-government.\nALL NATIONAL GROUPS SHALL HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS!\nThere shall be equal status in the bodies of state, in the courts and in the schools for all national groups and races;\nAll national groups shall be protected by law against insults to their race and national pride;\nAll people shall have equal rights to use their own language and to develop their own folk culture and customs;\nThe preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable crime;\nAll apartheid laws and practices shall be set aside.\nTHE PEOPLE SHALL SHARE IN THE COUNTRY\u2019S WEALTH!\nThe national wealth of our country, the heritage of all South Africans, shall be restored to the people;\nThe mineral wealth beneath the soil, the banks and monopoly industry shall be transferred to the ownership of the people as a whole;\nAll other industries and trade shall be controlled to assist the well-being of the people;\nAll people shall have equal rights to trade where they choose, to manufacture and to enter all trades, crafts and professions.\nTHE LAND SHALL BE SHARED AMONG THOSE WHO WORK IT!\nRestriction of land ownership on racial basis shall be ended, and all the land re-divided amongst those who work it, to banish famine and land hunger. . . .\n\nSome in the ANC, particularly the Africanist contingent, who were anti-Communist and antiwhite, objected to the charter as being a design for a\nradically different South Africa from the one the ANC had called for throughout its history. They claimed the charter favored a socialist order and\nbelieved the COD and white Communists had had a disproportionate influence on its ideology. In June , in the monthly journal Liberation, I\npointed out that the charter endorsed private enterprise and would allow capitalism to flourish among Africans for the first time. The charter\nguaranteed that when freedom came, Africans would have the opportunity to own their own businesses in their own names, to own their own houses\nand property, in short, to prosper as capitalists and entrepreneurs. The charter does not speak about the eradication of classes and private\nproperty, or public ownership of the means of production, or promulgate any of the tenets of scientific socialism. The clause discussing the possible\nnationalization of the mines, the banks, and monopoly industries was an action that needed to be taken if the economy was not to be solely owned\nand operated by white businessmen.\nThe charter was in fact a revolutionary document precisely because the changes it envisioned could not be achieved without radically altering the\neconomic and political structure of South Africa. It was not meant to be capitalist or socialist but a melding together of the people\u2019s demands to end\nthe oppression. In South Africa, to merely achieve fairness, one had to destroy apartheid itself, for it was the very embodiment of injustice.\n EVEN BEFORE THE TRIAL, my marriage to Evelyn had begun to unravel. In , Evelyn had become set on upgrading her four-year certificate in\ngeneral nursing. She enrolled in a midwifery course at King Edward VII Hospital in Durban that would keep her away from home for several months.\nThis was possible because my mother and sister were staying with us and could look after the children. During her stay in Durban, I visited her on at\nleast one occasion.\nEvelyn returned, having passed her examinations. She was pregnant again and later that year, gave birth to Makaziwe, named after the daughter\nwe had lost six years before. In our culture, to give a new child the name of a deceased child is considered a way of honoring the earlier child\u2019s\nmemory and retaining a mystical attachment to the child who left too soon.\nOver the course of the next year Evelyn became involved with the Watch Tower organization, part of the church of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Whether\nthis was due to some dissatisfaction with her life at the time, I do not know. The Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses took the Bible as the sole rule of faith and\nbelieved in a coming Armageddon between good and evil. Evelyn zealously began distributing their publication The Watchtower, and began to\nproselytize me as well, urging me to convert my commitment to the struggle to a commitment to God. Although I found some aspects of the Watch\nTower\u2019s system to be interesting and worthwhile, I could not and did not share her devotion. There was an obsessional element to it that put me off.\nFrom what I could discern, her faith taught passivity and submissiveness in the face of oppression, something I could not accept.\nMy devotion to the ANC and the struggle was unremitting. This disturbed Evelyn. She had always assumed that politics was a youthful diversion,\nthat I would someday return to the Transkei and practice there as a lawyer. Even as that possibility became remote, she never resigned herself to\nthe fact that Johannesburg would be our home, or let go of the idea that we might move back to Umtata. She believed that once I was back in the\nTranskei, in the bosom of my family, acting as counselor to Sabata, I would no longer miss politics. She encouraged Daliwonga\u2019s efforts to\npersuade me to come back to Umtata. We had many arguments about this, and I patiently explained to her that politics was not a distraction but my\nlifework, that it was an essential and fundamental part of my being. She could not accept this. A man and a woman who hold such different views of\ntheir respective roles in life cannot remain close.\nI tried to persuade her of the necessity of the struggle, while she attempted to persuade me of the value of religious faith. When I would tell her\nthat I was serving the nation, she would reply that serving God was above serving the nation. We were finding no common ground, and I was\nbecoming convinced that the marriage was no longer tenable.\nWe also waged a battle for the minds and hearts of the children. She wanted them to be religious, and I thought they should be political. She\nwould take them to church at every opportunity and read them Watch Tower literature. She even gave the boys Watchtower pamphlets to distribute\nin the township. I used to talk politics to the boys. Thembi was a member of the Pioneers, the juvenile section of the ANC, so he was already\npolitically cognizant. I would explain to Makgatho in the simplest terms how the black man was persecuted by the white man.\nHanging on the walls of the house, I had pictures of Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Gandhi, and the storming of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg\nin . I explained to the boys who each of the men was, and what he stood for. They knew that the white leaders of South Africa stood for\nsomething very different. One day, Makgatho came running into the house, and said, \u201cDaddy, Daddy, there is Malan on the hill!\u201d Malan had been the\nfirst Nationalist prime minister and the boy had confused him with a Bantu Education official, Willie Maree, who had announced that he would that\nday address a public meeting in the township. I went outside to see what Makgatho was talking about, for the ANC had organized a demonstration\nto ensure that the meeting did not succeed. As I went out, I saw a couple of police vans escorting Maree to the place he was meant to speak, but\nthere was trouble from the start and Maree had fled without delivering his speech. I told Makgatho that it was not Malan but might as well have been.\nMy schedule in those days was relentless. I would leave the house very early in the morning and return late at night. After a day at the office, I\nwould usually have meetings of one kind or another. Evelyn could not understand my meetings in the evening, and when I returned home late\nsuspected I was seeing other women. Time after time, I would explain what meeting I was at, why I was there, and what was discussed. But she was\nnot convinced. In , she gave me an ultimatum: I had to choose between her and the ANC.\nWalter and Albertina were very close to Evelyn, and their fondest wish was for us to stay together. Evelyn confided in Albertina. At one point,\nWalter intervened in the matter and I was very short with him, telling him it was none of his business. I regretted the tone I took, became Walter had\nalways been a brother to me and his friendship and support had never faltered.\nOne day, Walter told me he wanted to bring someone over to the office for me to meet. He did not tell me that it was my brother-in-law, and I was\nsurprised but not displeased to see him. I was pessimistic about the marriage and I thought it only fair to inform him of my feelings.\nWe were discussing this issue cordially among the three of us, when either Walter or I used a phrase like \u201cMen such as ourselves,\u201d or something\nof that ilk. Evelyn\u2019s brother-in-law was a businessman, opposed to politics and politicians. He became very huffy and said, \u201cIf you chaps think you\nare in the same position as myself, that is ridiculous. Do not compare yourselves to me.\u201d When he left, Walter and I looked at each other and\nstarted laughing.\nAfter we were arrested in December and kept in prison for two weeks, I had one visit from Evelyn. But when I came out of prison, I found that she\nhad moved out and taken the children. I returned to an empty, silent house. She had even removed the curtains, and for some reason I found this\nsmall detail shattering. Evelyn had moved in with her brother, who told me, \u201cPerhaps it is for the best; maybe when things will have cooled down you\nwill come back together.\u201d It was reasonable advice, but it was not to be.\nEvelyn and I had irreconcilable differences. I could not give up my life in the struggle, and she could not live with my devotion to something other\nthan herself and the family. She was a very good woman, charming, strong, and faithful, and a fine mother. I never lost my respect and admiration\nfor her, but in the end, we could not make our marriage work.\nThe breakup of any marriage is traumatic, especially for the children. Our family was no exception, and all of the children were wounded by our\nseparation. Makgatho took to sleeping in my bed. He was a gentle child, a natural peacemaker and he tried to bring about some sort of\nreconciliation between me and his mother. Makaziwe was still very small, and I remember one day, when I was not in prison or in court, I visited her\ncr\u00e8che (nursery school) unannounced. She had always been a very affectionate child, but that day, when she saw me, she froze. She did not know\nwhether to run to me or retreat, to smile or frown. She had some conflict in her small heart, which she did not know how to resolve. It was very\npainful.\nThembi, who was ten at the time, was the most deeply affected. He stopped studying and became withdrawn. He had once been keen on\nEnglish and Shakespeare, but after the separation he seemed to become apathetic about learning. The principal of his school spoke to me on one\noccasion, but there was little that I was able to do. I would take him to the gym whenever I could, and occasionally he would brighten a bit. There\nwere many times when I could not be there and later, when I was underground, Walter would take Thembi with him along with his own son. One\ntime, Walter took him to an event, and afterward Walter said to me, \u201cMan, that chap is quiet.\u201d Following the breakup, Thembi would frequently wear\nmy clothes, even though they were far too large for him; they gave him some kind of attachment to his too-often-distant father.\n IMMEDIATELY upon my return I reported on my trip to the Working Committee of the ANC. Their principal concern was whether or not the\nCongress Alliance was strong enough to halt the government\u2019s plans. I did not give them good news. I said the Transkei was not a well-organized\nANC area and the power of the security police would soon immobilize what little influence the ANC had.\nI put forth an alternative that I knew would be unpopular. Why shouldn\u2019t the ANC participate in the new Bantu Authorities structures as a means of\nremaining in touch with the masses of people? In time, such participation would become a platform for our own ideas and policies.\nAny suggestion of participating in apartheid structures in any way was automatically met with angry opposition. In my early days, I, too, would\nhave strenuously objected. But my sense of the country was that relatively few people were ready to make the sacrifices to join the struggle. We\nshould meet the people on their own terms, even if that meant appearing to collaborate. My idea was that our movement should be a great tent that\nincluded as many people as possible.\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAt the time, however, my report was given short shrift because of another related report with greater ramifications. The publication of the report of\nthe Tomlinson Commission for the Socio-Economic Development of the Bantu Areas had set off a nationwide debate. The government-created\ncommission proposed a plan for the development of the so-called Bantu Areas or bantustans. The result was in fact a blueprint for \u201cseparate\ndevelopment\u201d or grand apartheid.\nThe bantustan system had been conceived by Dr. H. F. Verwoerd, the minister of native affairs, as a way of muting international criticism of South\nAfrican racial policies but at the same time institutionalizing apartheid. The bantustans, or reserves as they were also known, would be separate\nethnic enclaves or homelands for all African citizens. Africans, Verwoerd said, \u201cshould stand with both feet in the reserves\u201d where they were to\n\u201cdevelop along their own lines.\u201d The idea was to preserve the status quo where three million whites owned  percent of the land, and relegate the\neight million Africans to the remaining  percent.\nThe central theme of the report was the rejection of the idea of integration between the races in favor of a policy of separate development of\nblack and white. To that end, the report recommended the industrialization of the African areas, noting that any program of development that did not\naim at providing opportunities for Africans in their own regions was doomed to failure. The commission pointed out that the present geographical\nconfiguration of the African areas was too fragmentary, and recommended instead a consolidation of African areas into what it termed seven\n\u201chistorical-logical\u201d homelands of the principal ethnic groups.\nBut the creation of individual, self-contained bantustans, as proposed by the commission, was farcical. Transkei, the showpiece of the proposed\nhomeland system, would be broken into three geographically separate blocks. The Swazi bantustan, Lebowa, and Venda were composed of three\npieces each; Gazankule, four; the Ciskei, seventeen; Bophuthatswana, nineteen; and KwaZulu, twenty-nine. The Nationalists were creating a cruel\njigsaw puzzle out of people\u2019s lives.\nThe government\u2019s intention in creating the homeland system was to keep the Transkei \u2014 and other African areas \u2014 as reservoirs of cheap labor\nfor white industry. At the same time, the covert goal of the government was to create an African middle class to blunt the appeal of the ANC and the\nliberation struggle.\nThe ANC denounced the report of the Tomlinson Commission, despite some of its more liberal recommendations. As I told Daliwonga, separate\ndevelopment was a spurious solution to a problem that whites had no idea how to control. In the end, the government approved the report, but\nrejected a number of its recommendations as being too progressive.\n\nDespite the encroaching darkness and my pessimism about the government\u2019s policies, I was thinking about the future. In February , I returned\nto the Transkei to purchase a plot of land in Umtata. I have always thought a man should own a house near the place he was born, where he might\nfind a restfulness that eludes him elsewhere.\nWith Walter, I journeyed down to the Transkei. Walter and I met with various ANC people in both Umtata and Durban, where we went first. Once\nagain, we were clumsily shadowed by Special Branch police. In Durban, we paid a call on our colleagues at the Natal Indian Congress in an effort\nto boost activism in the area.\nIn Umtata, with Walter\u2019s help, I made a down payment to C. K. Sakwe for a plot of land he owned in town. Sakwe was a member of the Bunga\nand had served on the Natives Representative Council. While we were there he told us of an incident that had occurred the previous Saturday at\nBumbhane, the Great Place of Sabata, at a meeting of government officials and chiefs about the introduction of the bantustans. A number of the\nchiefs objected to the government\u2019s policy and verbally attacked the magistrate. The meeting broke up in anger; this gave us some sense of the\ngrassroots objections to the Bantu Authorities Act.\nIn March , after several months of relative freedom, I received my third ban, which restricted me to Johannesburg for five years and\nprohibited me from attending meetings for that same period. For the next sixty months I would be quarantined in the same district, seeing the same\nstreets, the same mine dumps on the horizon, the same sky. I would have to depend on newspapers and other people for reports on what was\noccurring outside of Johannesburg, another prospect I did not relish.\nBut this time my attitude toward my bans had changed radically. When I was first banned I abided by the rules and regulations of my persecutors.\nI had now developed contempt for these restrictions. I was not going to let my involvement in the struggle and the scope of my political activities be\ndetermined by the enemy I was fighting against. To allow my activities to be circumscribed by my opponent was a form of defeat, and I resolved not\nto become my own jailer.\nI soon became involved in mediating a bitter political dispute right in Johannesburg. It pitted two sides against each other, both of which were\nseeking my support. Each side within this particular organization had legitimate grievances and each side was implacably opposed to the other.\nThe altercation threatened to descend into an acrimonious civil war, and I did my best to prevent a rupture. I am speaking, of course, of the struggle\nat the boxing and weight lifting club at the Donaldson Orlando Community Center where I trained almost every evening.\nI had joined the club in , and on almost every free night I worked out at the Community Center. For the previous few years I had taken my\nson, Thembi, with me, and by , when he was ten years old, he was a keen if spindly paperweight boxer. The club was managed by Johannes\n(Skipper Adonis) Molotsi, and its membership consisted of both professional and amateur boxers, as well as a variety of dedicated weight lifters.\nOur star boxer, Jerry (Uyinja) Moloi, later became the Transvaal lightweight champion and number one contender for the national title.\nThe gym was poorly equipped. We could not afford a ring and trained on a cement floor, which was particularly dangerous when a boxer was\n\n\fknocked down. We boasted a single punching bag and a few pairs of boxing gloves. We had no medicine or speed balls, no proper boxing trunks\nor shoes, and no mouth guards. Almost no one owned head guards. Despite the lack of equipment, the gym produced such champions as Eric\n(Black Material) Ntsele, bantamweight champion of South Africa, and Freddie (Tomahawk) Ngidi, the Transvaal flyweight champion, who spent his\ndays working for me as an assistant at Mandela and Tambo. Altogether, we had perhaps twenty or thirty members.\nAlthough I had boxed a bit at Fort Hare, it was not until I had lived in Johannesburg that I took up the sport in earnest. I was never an outstanding\nboxer. I was in the heavyweight division, and I had neither enough power to compensate for my lack of speed nor enough speed to make up for my\nlack of power. I did not enjoy the violence of boxing so much as the science of it. I was intrigued by how one moved one\u2019s body to protect oneself,\nhow one used a strategy both to attack and retreat, how one paced oneself over a match. Boxing is egalitarian. In the ring, rank, age, color, and\nwealth are irrelevant. When you are circling your opponent, probing his strengths and weaknesses, you are not thinking about his color or social\nstatus. I never did any real fighting after I entered politics. My main interest was in training; I found the rigorous exercise to be an excellent outlet for\ntension and stress. After a strenuous workout, I felt both mentally and physically lighter. It was a way of losing myself in something that was not the\nstruggle. After an evening\u2019s workout I would wake up the next morning feeling strong and refreshed, ready to take up the fight again.\nI attended the gym for one and a half hours each evening from Monday through Thursday. I would go home directly after work, pick up Thembi,\nthen drive to the Community Center. We did an hour of exercise, some combination of roadwork, skipping rope, calisthenics, or shadow boxing,\nfollowed by fifteen minutes of body work, some weight lifting and then sparring. If we were training for a fight or a tournament, we would extend the\ntraining time to two and a half hours.\nWe each took turns leading the training sessions in order to develop leadership, initiative, and self-confidence. Thembi particularly enjoyed\nleading these sessions. Things would get a bit rough for me on the nights that my son was in charge, for he would single me out for criticism. He\nwas quick to chastise me whenever I got lazy. Everybody in the gym called me \u201cChief,\u201d an honorific he avoided, calling me \u201cMister Mandela,\u201d and\noccasionally, when he felt sympathy for his old man, \u201cMy bra,\u201d township slang meaning \u201cMy brother.\u201d When he saw me loafing, he would say in a\nstern voice, \u201cMister Mandela, you are wasting our time this evening. If you cannot keep up, why not go home and sit with the old women.\u201d Everyone\nenjoyed these jibes immensely, and it gave me pleasure to see my son so happy and confident.\nThe camaraderie of the club was shattered that year because of a spat between Skipper Molotsi and Jerry Moloi. Jerry and the other boxers felt\nthat Skipper was not paying enough attention to the club. Skipper was a skillful coach, but was rarely present to impart his knowledge. He was a\nhistorian of boxing lore and could narrate all twenty-six rounds of Jack Johnson\u2019s famous bout in Havana in  when the first black heavyweight\nchampion of the world lost his title. But Skipper tended to appear only before a match or a tournament to collect the small fee that was his due. I\nmyself was sympathetic to Jerry\u2019s point of view but did my best to patch up the quarrel in the interest of keeping harmony. In the end, even my son\nagreed with Jerry\u2019s criticism of Skipper and there was nothing I could do to prevent a rupture.\nThe boxers, under Jerry\u2019s leadership, threatened to secede from the club and start their own. I called a meeting for all the members and it was a\nlively session \u2014 conducted in Sesotho, Zulu, Xhosa, and English. Shakespeare was even cited by Skipper in his attack against the rebellious\nboxers, accusing Jerry of double-crossing him as Brutus had betrayed Caesar. \u201cWho are Caesar and Brutus?\u201d my son asked. Before I could\nanswer, someone said, \u201cAren\u2019t they dead?\u201d To which Skipper replied, \u201cYes, but the truth about the betrayal is very much alive!\u201d\nThe meeting resolved nothing and the boxers left for another venue while the weight lifters remained at the Community Center. I joined the boxers\nand for the first few weeks of the separation we trained at an uncomfortable place for a freedom fighter, the police gymnasium. Thereafter, the\nAnglican Church gave us premises at a reasonable rental in Orlando East, and we trained under Simon (Mshengu) Tshabalala, who later became\none of the ANC\u2019s leading underground freedom fighters.\nOur new facilities were no better than the old, and the club was never reconstituted. African boxers, like all black athletes and artists, were\nshackled by the twin handicaps of poverty and racism. What money an African boxer earned was typically used on food, rent, clothing, and\nwhatever was left went to boxing equipment and training. He was denied the opportunity of belonging to the white boxing clubs that had the\nequipment and trainers necessary to produce a first-rate, world-class boxer. Unlike white professional boxers, African professional boxers had fulltime day jobs. Sparring partners were few and poorly paid; without proper drilling and practice, the performance greatly suffered. Yet a number of\nAfrican fighters were able to triumph over these difficulties and achieve great success. Boxers like Elijah (Maestro) Mokone, Enoch (Schoolboy)\nNhlapo, Kangaroo Maoto, one of the greatest stylists of the ring, Levi (Golden Boy) Madi, Nkosana Mgxaji, Mackeed Mofokeng, and Norman\nSekgapane, all won great victories, while Jake Tuli, our greatest hero, won the British and Empire flyweight title. He was the most eloquent example\nof what African boxers could achieve if given the opportunity. IT IS SAID that the mills of God grind exceedingly slowly, but even the Lord\u2019s machinations can\u2019t compete with those of the South African judicial\nsystem. On August , , two years and eight months after our arrests, and after a full year of legal maneuvering, the actual trial commenced at\nthe Old Synagogue in Pretoria. We were finally formally arraigned and all thirty of us pleaded not guilty.\nOur defense team was once again led by Issy Maisels, and he was assisted by Sydney Kentridge, Bram Fischer, and Vernon Berrang\u00e9. This\ntime, at long last, the trial was in earnest. During the first two months of the case, the Crown entered some two thousand documents into the record\nand called two hundred ten witnesses, two hundred of whom were members of the Special Branch. These detectives admitted to hiding in closets\nand under beds, posing as ANC members, perpetrating virtually any deception that would enable them to get information about our organization.\nYet many of the documents the state submitted and the speeches they transcribed were public documents, public speeches, information available\nto all. As before, much of the Crown\u2019s evidence consisted of books, papers, and documents seized from the accused during numerous raids that\ntook place between  and , as well as notes taken by the police at Congress meetings during this same period. As before, the reports by\nthe Special Branch officers of our speeches were generally muddled. We used to joke that between the poor acoustics of the hall and the confused\nand inaccurate reports of the Special Branch detectives, we could be fined for what we did not say, imprisoned for what we could not hear, and\nhanged for what we did not do.\nEach day at lunchtime we were permitted to sit outside in the spacious garden of a neighboring vicarage where we were supplied with a meal\ncooked by the redoubtable Mrs. Thayanagee Pillay and her friends. They prepared a spicy Indian lunch for us almost every day, and also tea,\ncoffee, and sandwiches during the morning and afternoon breaks. These respites were like tiny vacations from court, and were a chance for us to\ndiscuss politics with each other. Those moments under the shade of the jacaranda trees on the vicarage lawn were the most pleasant of the trial, for\nin many ways the case was more a test of our endurance than a trial of justice.\n\nOn the morning of October , as we were preparing to go to court, we heard an announcement on the radio that the prosecutor, Oswald Pirow,\nhad died suddenly from a stroke. His death was a severe setback to the government, and the effectiveness and aggressiveness of the Crown team\ndiminished from that point on. In court that day, Judge Rumpff gave an emotional eulogy to Pirow, and praised his legal acumen and thoroughness.\nAlthough we would benefit from his absence, we did not rejoice at his death. We had developed a certain affection for our opponent, for despite\nPirow\u2019s noxious political views, he was a humane man without the virulent personal racism of the government he was acting for. His habitual polite\nreference to us as \u201cAfricans\u201d (even one of our own attorneys occasionally slipped and referred to us as \u201cnatives\u201d) contrasted with his supremacist\npolitical leanings. In a curious way, our small world inside the Old Synagogue seemed balanced when, each morning, we observed Pirow reading\nthe right-wing Nuwe Order at his table and Bram Fischer reading the left-wing New Age at ours. His donation to us of the more than one hundred\nvolumes of the preparatory examination free of charge was a generous gesture that saved the defense a great deal of money. Advocate De Vos\nbecame the new leader of the Crown\u2019s team and could not match the eloquence or acuity of his predecessor.\n\nShortly after Pirow\u2019s death, the prosecution concluded its submission of evidence. It was then that the prosecution began its examination of expert\nwitnesses commencing with the long-suffering Professor Murray, its supposed expert in communism who had proved so inept in his subject during\nthe preparatory examination. In a relentless cross-examination by Maisels, Murray admitted that the charter was in fact a humanitarian document\nthat might well represent the natural reaction and aspirations of nonwhites to the harsh conditions in South Africa.\nMurray was not the only Crown witness who did little to advance the state\u2019s case. Despite the voluminous amount of Crown evidence and the\npages and pages of testimony from their expert witnesses, the prosecution had not managed to produce any valid evidence that the ANC plotted\nviolence, and they knew it. Then, in March, the prosecution displayed a new burst of confidence. They were about to release their most damning\nevidence. With great fanfare and a long drumroll in the press, the state played for the court a secretly recorded speech of Robert Resha\u2019s. The\nspeech was given in his capacity as Transvaal Volunteer-in-Chief to a roomful of Freedom Volunteers in , a few weeks before we were all to\nbe arrested. The courtroom was very quiet, and despite the static of the recording and the background din, one could make out Robert\u2019s words very\nclearly.\nWhen you are disciplined and you are told by the organization not to be violent, you must not be violent . . . but if you are a true volunteer and you are called upon to be violent, you\nmust be absolutely violent, you must murder! Murder! That is all.\n\nThe prosecution believed it had sealed its case. Newspapers prominently featured Resha\u2019s words and echoed the sensibilities of the state. To\nthe Crown, the speech revealed the ANC\u2019s true and secret intent, unmasking the ANC\u2019s public pretense of nonviolence. But in fact, Resha\u2019s words\nwere an anomaly. Robert was an excellent if rather excitable platform speaker, and his choice of analogy was unfortunate. But as the defense would\nshow, he was merely emphasizing the importance of discipline and that the volunteer must do whatever he is ordered, however unsavory. Over and\nover, our witnesses would show that Resha\u2019s speech was not only taken out of context but did not represent ANC policy.\n\nThe prosecution concluded its case on March , , and we were to call our first witness for the defense four days later. We had been in the\ndoldrums for months, but as we started to prepare ourselves for our testimony, we were eager to go on the offensive. We had been parrying the\nenemy\u2019s attacks for too long.\nThere had been much speculation in the press that our first witness would be Chief Luthuli. The Crown apparently believed that as well, for there\nwas great consternation among the prosecution when, on March , our first witness was not Luthuli but Dr. Wilson Conco.\nConco was the son of a Zulu cattle farmer from the beautiful Ixopo district of Natal. In addition to being a practicing physician, he had been one of\nthe founders of the Youth League, an active participant in the Defiance Campaign, and the treasurer of the ANC. As a preparation for his testimony,\nhe was asked about his brilliant academic record at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he graduated first in his medical school class,\nahead of all the sons and daughters of white privilege. As Conco\u2019s credentials were cited, I got the distinct impression that Justice Kennedy, who\nwas also from Natal, seemed proud. Natalians are noted for their loyalty to their region, and these peculiar bonds of attachment can sometimes\neven transcend color. Indeed, many Natalians thought of themselves as white Zulus. Justice Kennedy had always seemed to be a fair-minded man,\nand I sensed that through Wilson Conco\u2019s example, he began to see us not as heedless rabble-rousers but men of worthy ambitions who could help\n\n\ftheir country if their country would only help them. At the end of Conco\u2019s testimony, when Conco was cited for some medical achievement, Kennedy\nsaid in Zulu, a language in which he was fluent, \u201cSinjalo thina maZulu,\u201d which means, \u201cWe Zulus are like that.\u201d Dr. Conco proved a calm and\narticulate witness who reaffirmed the ANC\u2019s commitment to nonviolence.\nChief Luthuli was next. With his dignity and sincerity, he made a deep impression on the court. He was suffering from high blood pressure, and\nthe court agreed to sit only in the mornings while he gave evidence. His evidence-in-chief lasted several days and he was cross-examined for\nnearly three weeks. He carefully outlined the evolution of the ANC\u2019s policy, putting things simply and clearly, and his former positions as teacher and\nchief imparted an added gravity and authority to his words. As a devout Christian, he was the perfect person to discuss how the ANC had sincerely\nstrived for racial harmony.\nThe chief testified to his belief in the innate goodness of man and how moral persuasion plus economic pressure could well lead to a change of\nheart on the part of white South Africans. In discussing the ANC\u2019s policy of nonviolence, he emphasized that there was a difference between\nnonviolence and pacifism. Pacifists refused to defend themselves even when violently attacked, but that was not necessarily the case with those\nwho espoused nonviolence. Sometimes men and nations, even when nonviolent, had to defend themselves when they were attacked.\nAs I listened to Conco and Luthuli, I thought that here, probably for the first time in their lives, the judges were listening not to their domestic\nservants who said only what they knew their masters would like to hear, but to independent and articulate Africans spelling out their political beliefs\nand how they hoped to realize them.\nThe chief was cross-examined by Advocate Trengove, who doggedly attempted to get him to say the ANC was dominated by Communists and\nhad a dual policy of nonviolence intended for the public and a secret plan of waging violent revolution. The chief steadfastly refuted the implications\nof what Trengove was suggesting. He himself was the soul of moderation, particularly as Trengove seemed to lose control. At one point, Trengove\naccused the chief of hypocrisy. The chief ignored Trengove\u2019s aspersion and calmly remarked to the bench, \u201cMy Lord, I think the Crown is running\nwild.\u201d\nBut on March , the chief\u2019s testimony was interrupted by a shattering event outside the courtroom. On that day, the country was rocked by an\noccurrence of such magnitude that when Chief Luthuli returned to testify a month later, the courtroom \u2014 and all of South Africa \u2014 was a different\nplace. ON JANUARY , , we once again assembled in the Drill Hall. It was the defense\u2019s turn to refute the state\u2019s charges. After summarizing the\nCrown\u2019s case against us, Vernon Berrang\u00e9, our lead counsel, announced our argument. \u201cThe defense,\u201d he said, \u201cwill strenuously repudiate that the\nterms of the Freedom Charter are treasonable or criminal. On the contrary, the defense will contend that the ideas and beliefs which are expressed\nin this charter, although repugnant to the policy of the present government, are such as are shared by the overwhelming majority of mankind of all\nraces and colors, and also by the overwhelming majority of the citizens of this country.\u201d In consultation with our attorneys, we had decided that we\nwere not merely going to prove that we were innocent of treason, but that this was a political trial in which the government was persecuting us for\ntaking actions that were morally justified.\nBut the drama of the opening arguments was succeeded by the tedium of court logistics. The first month of the trial was taken up by the state\u2019s\nsubmission of evidence. One by one, every paper, pamphlet, document, book, notebook, letter, magazine, and clipping that the police had\naccumulated in the last three years of searches was produced and numbered; twelve thousand in all. The submissions ranged from the United\nNations Declaration of Human Rights to a Russian cookbook. They even submitted the two signs from the Congress of the People: \u201cSOUP WITH\nMEAT\u201d and \u201cSOUP WITHOUT MEAT.\u201d\nDuring the preparatory examination, which was to last for months, we listened day after day as African and Afrikaner detectives read out their\nnotes of ANC meetings, or transcripts of speeches. These recountings were always garbled, and often either nonsensical or downright false.\nBerrang\u00e9 later revealed in his deft cross-examination that many of the African detectives were unable to understand or write English, the language\nin which the speeches were given.\n\nTo support the state\u2019s extraordinary allegation that we intended to replace the existing government with a Soviet-style state, the Crown relied on the\nevidence of Professor Andrew Murray, head of the Department of Political Science at the University of Cape Town. Murray labeled many of the\ndocuments seized from us, including the Freedom Charter itself, as communistic.\nProfessor Murray seemed, at the outset, relatively knowledgeable, but that was until Berrang\u00e9 began his cross-examination. Berrang\u00e9 said that\nhe wanted to read Murray a number of passages from various documents and then have Murray label them communistic or not. Berrang\u00e9 read him\nthe first passage, which concerned the need for ordinary workers to cooperate with each other and not exploit one another. Communistic, Murray\nsaid. Berrang\u00e9 then noted that the statement had been made by the former premier of South Africa, Dr. Malan. Berrang\u00e9 proceeded to read him\ntwo other statements, both of which Professor Murray described as communistic. These passages had in fact been uttered by the American\npresidents Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson. The highlight came when Berrang\u00e9 read Murray a passage that the professor unhesitatingly\ndescribed as \u201ccommunism straight from the shoulder.\u201d Berrang\u00e9 then revealed that it was a statement that Professor Murray himself had written in\nthe s.\nIn the seventh month of the trial, the state said it would produce evidence of planned violence that occurred during the Defiance Campaign. The\nstate called the first of their star witnesses, Solomon Ngubase, who offered sensational evidence that seemed to implicate the ANC. Ngubase was\na soft-spoken fellow in his late thirties, with a shaky command of English, who was currently serving a sentence for fraud. In his opening testimony,\nNgubase told the court he had obtained a bachelor of arts degree from Fort Hare, and that he was a practicing attorney. He said he became\nsecretary of the Port Elizabeth branch of the ANC as well as a member of the National Executive Committee. He claimed to have been present at a\nmeeting of the National Executive when a decision was made to send Walter Sisulu and David Bopape to the Soviet Union to procure arms for a\nviolent revolution in South Africa. He said he was present at a meeting that planned the  Port Elizabeth riot and that he had witnessed an ANC\ndecision to murder all whites in the Transkei in the same manner as the Mau Mau in Kenya. Ngubase\u2019s dramatic testimony caused a stir in and out\nof court. Here at long last was evidence of a conspiracy.\nBut when Ngubase was cross-examined by Vernon Berrang\u00e9, it was revealed that he was equal parts madman and liar. Berrang\u00e9, whose crossexamination skills earned him the nickname Isangoma (a diviner or healer who exorcises an illness) among the accused, quickly established that\nNgubase was neither a university graduate nor a member of the ANC, much less a member of the National Executive Committee. Berrang\u00e9\nshowed that Ngubase had forged certificates for a university degree, had practiced law illegally for several years, and had a further case of fraud\npending against him. At the time of the meeting he claimed to have attended to plan the Port Elizabeth riot, he was serving a sentence for fraud in a\nDurban jail. Almost none of Ngubase\u2019s testimony bore even a remote resemblance to the truth. At the end of his cross-examination, Berrang\u00e9\nasked the witness, \u201cDo you know what a rogue is?\u201d Ngubase said he did not. \u201cYou, sir, are a rogue!\u201d Berrang\u00e9 exclaimed.\nJoe Slovo, one of the accused and a superb advocate, conducted his own defense. He was an irritant to the state because of his sharp\nquestions and attempts to show that the state was the violator of laws, not the Congress. Slovo\u2019s cross-examination was often as devastating as\nBerrang\u00e8\u2019s. Detective Jeremiah Mollson, one of the few African members of the Special Branch, claimed to recall lines verbatim from ANC\nspeeches that he attended. But what he reported was usually gibberish or outright fabrication.\nSlovo: \u201cDo you understand English?\u201d\nMollson: \u201cNot so well.\u201d\nSlovo: \u201cDo you mean to say that you reported these speeches in English but you don\u2019t understand English well?\u201d\nMollson: \u201cYes, Your Worship.\u201d\nSlovo: \u201cDo you agree that your notes are a lot of rubbish?\u201d\nMollson: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThis last response caused an outbreak of laughter from the defendants. The magistrate scolded us for laughing, and said, \u201cThe proceedings are\nnot as funny as they may seem.\u201d\nAt one point, Wessel told Slovo that he was impugning the integrity of the court and fined him for contempt. This provoked the fury of most of the\naccused, and it was only Chief Luthuli\u2019s restraining hand that kept a number of the defendants from being cited for contempt as well.\nAs the testimony continued, much of it tedious legal maneuvering, we began to occupy ourselves with other matters. I often brought a book to\nread or a legal brief to work on. Others read newspapers, did crossword puzzles, or played chess or Scrabble. Occasionally, the bench would\nreprimand us for not paying attention, and the books and puzzles would disappear. But, slowly, as the testimony resumed its snail\u2019s pace, the\ngames and reading material reemerged.\nAs the preparatory examination continued, the state became increasingly desperate. It became more and more apparent that the state was\ngathering \u2014 often fabricating \u2014 evidence as it went along, to help in what seemed to be a lost cause.\nFinally, on September , ten months after we had first assembled in the Drill Hall, the prosecutor announced that the state\u2019s case in the\n\n\fpreparatory examination was completed. The magistrate gave the defense four months to sift through the eight thousand pages of typed evidence\nand twelve thousand documents to prepare its case.\nThe preparatory examination had lasted for the whole of . Court adjourned in September, and the defense began reviewing the evidence.\nThree months later, without warning and without explanation, the Crown announced that charges against sixty-one of the accused were to be\ndropped. Most of these defendants were relatively minor figures in the ANC, but also among them were Chief Luthuli and Oliver Tambo. The\nCrown\u2019s release of Luthuli and Tambo pleased but bewildered us.\nIn January, when the government was scheduled to sum up its charges, the Crown brought in a new prosecutor, the formidable Oswald Pirow,\nQ.C. Pirow was a former minister of justice and of defense and a pillar of National Party politics. He was a longtime Afrikaner nationalist, and an\noutspoken supporter of the Nazi cause; he once described Hitler as the \u201cgreatest man of his age.\u201d He was a virulent anti-Communist. The\nappointment of Pirow was new evidence that the state was worried about the outcome and attached tremendous importance to a victory.\nBefore Pirow\u2019s summing-up, Berrang\u00e9 announced he would apply for our discharge on the grounds that the state had not offered sufficient\nevidence against us. Pirow opposed this application for dismissal, and quoted from several inflammatory speeches by the accused, informing the\ncourt that the police had unearthed more evidence of a highly dangerous conspiracy. The country, he said portentously, was sitting on top of a\nvolcano. It was an effective and highly dramatic performance. Pirow changed the atmosphere of the trial. We had become overconfident, and were\nreminded that we were facing a serious charge. Don\u2019t fool yourselves, counsel told us, you people might go to jail. Their warnings sobered us.\nAfter thirteen months of the preparatory examination, the magistrate ruled that he had found \u201csufficient reason\u201d for putting us on trial in the\nTransvaal Supreme Court for high treason. Court adjourned in January with the ninety-five remaining defendants committed to stand trial. When the\nactual trial would begin, we did not know. FEW ISSUES touched a nerve as much as that of passes for women. The state had not weakened in its resolve to impose passes on women and\nwomen had not weakened in their resolve to resist. Although the government now called passes \u201creference books,\u201d women weren\u2019t fooled: they\ncould still be fined ten pounds or imprisoned for a month for failing to produce their \u201creference book.\u201d\nIn , spurred by the efforts of the ANC Women\u2019s League, women all across the country, in rural areas and in cities, reacted with fury to the\nstate\u2019s insistence that they carry passes. The women were courageous, persistent, enthusiastic, indefatigable, and their protest against passes set\na standard for antigovernment protest that was never equaled. As Chief Luthuli said, \u201cWhen the women begin to take an active part in the struggle,\nno power on earth can stop us from achieving freedom in our lifetime.\u201d\nAll across the southeastern Transvaal, in Standerton, Heidelberg, Balfour, and other dorps, thousands of women protested. On recess from the\nTreason Trial, Frances Baard and Florence Matomela organized women to refuse passes in Port Elizabeth, their hometown. In Johannesburg, in\nOctober, a large group of women gathered at the central pass office, and chased away women who had come to collect passes and clerks who\nworked in the office, bringing the office to a standstill. Police arrested hundreds of the women.\nNot long after these arrests, Winnie and I were relaxing after supper when she quietly informed me that she intended to join the group of Orlando\nwomen who would be protesting the following day at the pass office. I was a bit taken aback, and while I was pleased at her sense of commitment\nand admired her courage, I was also wary. Winnie had become increasingly politicized since our marriage, and had joined the Orlando West\nbranch of the ANC\u2019s Women\u2019s League, all of which I encouraged.\nI told her I welcomed her decision, but that I had to warn her about the seriousness of her action. It would, I said, in a single act, radically change\nher life. By African standards, Winnie was from a well-to-do family and had been shielded from some of the more unpleasant realities of life in\nSouth Africa. At the very least, she never had had to worry about where her next meal was coming from. Before our marriage, she had moved in\ncircles of relative wealth and comfort, a life very different from the often hand-to-mouth existence of the freedom fighter.\nI told her that if she was arrested she would be certain to be fired by her employer, the provincial administration \u2014 we both knew that it was her\nsmall income that was supporting the household \u2014 and that she could probably never work again as a social worker, since the stigma of\nimprisonment would make public agencies reluctant to hire her. Finally, she was pregnant, and I warned her of the physical hardship and\nhumiliations of jail. My response may sound harsh, but I felt responsibility both as a husband and as a leader of the struggle, to be as clear as\npossible about the ramifications of her action. I, myself, had mixed emotions, for the concerns of a husband and a leader do not always coincide.\nBut Winnie is a determined person, and I suspect my pessimistic reaction only strengthened her resolve. She listened to all I said and informed\nme that her mind was made up. The next morning I rose early to make her breakfast, and we drove over to the Sisulus\u2019 house to meet Walter\u2019s wife,\nAlbertina, one of the leaders of the protest. We then drove to the Phefeni station in Orlando, where the women would get the train into town. I\nembraced her before she boarded the train. Winnie was nervous yet resolute as she waved to me from the train, and I felt as though she were\nsetting out on a long and perilous journey, the end of which neither of us could know.\n\nHundreds of women converged on the Central Pass Office in downtown Johannesburg. They were old and young; some carried babies on their\nbacks, some wore tribal blankets, while others had on smart suits. They sang, marched, and chanted. Within minutes, they were surrounded by\ndozens of armed police, who arrested all of them, packed them into vans, and drove them to Marshall Square police station. The women were\ncheerful throughout; as they were being driven away, some called out to reporters, \u201cTell our madams we won\u2019t be at work tomorrow!\u201d All told, more\nthan one thousand women were arrested.\nI knew this not because I was the husband of one of the detainees but because Mandela and Tambo had been called on to represent most of the\nwomen who had been arrested. I quickly made my way to Marshall Square to visit the prisoners and arrange bail. I managed to see Winnie, who\nbeamed when she saw me and seemed as happy as one could be in a bare police cell. It was as if she had given me a great gift that she knew\nwould please me. I told her I was proud of her, but I could not stay and talk as I had quite a lot of legal work to do.\nBy the end of the second day, the number of arrests had increased and nearly two thousand women were incarcerated, many of them remanded\nto the Fort to await trial. This created formidable problems not only for Oliver and me, but for the police and the prison authorities. There was simply\nnot enough space to hold them all. There were too few blankets, too few mats and toilets, and too little food. Conditions at the Fort were cramped\nand dirty. While many in the ANC, including myself, were eager to bail out the women, Lilian Ngoyi, the national president of the Women\u2019s League,\nand Helen Joseph, secretary of the South African Women\u2019s Federation, believed that for the protest to be genuine and effective, the women should\nserve whatever time the magistrate ordered. I remonstrated with them but was told in no uncertain terms that the matter was the women\u2019s affair and\nthat the ANC \u2014 as well as anxious husbands \u2014 should not meddle. I did tell Lilian that I thought she should discuss the issue with the women\nthemselves before making a decision, and escorted her down to the cells where she could poll the prisoners. Many were desperate to be bailed out\nand had not been adequately prepared for what would await them in prison. As a compromise, I suggested to Lilian that the women spend a\nfortnight in prison, after which we would bail them out. Lilian accepted.\nOver the next two weeks, I spent many hours in court arranging bail for the women. A few were frustrated and took their anger out on me.\n\u201cMandela, I am tired of this case of yours,\u201d one woman said to me. \u201cIf this does not end today I will not ever reappear in court.\u201d With the help of\nrelatives and fund-raising organizations, we managed to bail them all out within two weeks.\nWinnie did not seem the worse for wear from her prison experience. If she had suffered, she would not have told me anyway. While she was in\nprison Winnie became friendly with two teenaged Afrikaner wardresses. They were sympathetic and curious, and after Winnie was released on\nbail, we invited them to visit us. They accepted and traveled by train to Orlando. We gave them lunch at the house and afterward Winnie took them\nfor a tour of the township. Winnie and the two wardresses were about the same age and got on well. They laughed together as though they were all\nsisters. The two girls had an enjoyable day and thanked Winnie, saying that they would like to return. As it turned out, this was not to be, for in\ntraveling to Orlando they had, of necessity, sat in a non-White carriage. (There were no white trains to Orlando for the simple reason that no whites\nwent to Orlando.) As a result, they attracted a great deal of attention and it was soon widely known that two Afrikaner wardresses from the Fort had\nvisited Winnie and me. This was not a problem for us, but it proved to be one for them: the prison authorities dismissed them. We never saw nor\nheard from them again. ONE AFTERNOON, during a recess in the preparatory examination, I drove a friend of mine from Orlando to the medical school at the University of\nthe Witwatersrand and went past Baragwanath Hospital, the premier black hospital in Johannesburg. As I passed a nearby bus stop, I noticed out\nof the corner of my eye a lovely young woman waiting for the bus. I was struck by her beauty, and I turned my head to get a better look at her, but my\ncar had gone by too fast. This woman\u2019s face stayed with me \u2014 I even considered turning around to drive by her in the other direction \u2014 but I went\non.\nSome weeks thereafter, a curious coincidence occurred. I was at the office, and when I popped in to see Oliver, there was this same young\nwoman with her brother, sitting in front of Oliver\u2019s desk. I was taken aback, and did my best not to show my surprise \u2014 or my delight \u2014 at this\nstriking coincidence. Oliver introduced me to them and explained that they were visiting him on a legal matter.\nHer name was Nomzamo Winifred Madikizela, but she was known as Winnie. She had recently completed her studies at the Jan Hofmeyr School\nof Social Work in Johannesburg and was working as the first black female social worker at Baragwanath Hospital. At the time I paid little attention\nto her background or legal problem, for something in me was deeply stirred by her presence. I was thinking more of how I could ask her out than\nhow our firm would handle her case. I cannot say for certain if there is such a thing as love at first sight, but I do know that the moment I first\nglimpsed Winnie Nomzamo, I knew that I wanted to have her as my wife.\nWinnie was the sixth of eleven children of C. K. Madikizela, a school principal turned businessman. Her given name was Nomzamo, which\nmeans one who strives or undergoes trials, a name as prophetic as my own. She came from Bizana in Pondoland, an area adjacent to the part of\nthe Transkei where I grew up. She is from the Phondo clan of amaNgutyana, and her great-grandfather was Madikizela, a powerful chief from\nnineteenth-century Natal who settled in the Transkei at the time of the iMfecane.\nI telephoned Winnie the next day at the hospital and asked her for help in raising money for the Treason Trial Defense Fund from the Jan Hofmeyr\nSchool. It was merely a pretext to invite her to lunch, which I did. I picked her up where she was staying in town, and took her to an Indian restaurant\nnear my office, one of the few places that served Africans and where I frequently ate. Winnie was dazzling, and even the fact that she had never\nbefore tasted curry and drank glass after glass of water to cool her palate only added to her charm.\nAfter lunch I took her for a drive to an area between Johannesburg and Evaton, an open veld just past Eldorado Park. We walked on the long\ngrass, grass so similar to that of the Transkei where we both had been raised. I told her of my hopes and of the difficulties of the Treason Trial. I\nknew right there that I wanted to marry her \u2014 and I told her so. Her spirit, her passion, her youth, her courage, her willfulness \u2014 I felt all of these\nthings the moment I first saw her.\nOver the next weeks and months we saw each other whenever we could. She visited me at the Drill Hall and at my office. She came to see me\nwork out in the gym; she met Thembi, Makgatho, and Makaziwe. She came to meetings and political discussions; I was both courting her and\npoliticizing her. As a student, Winnie had been attracted to the Non-European Unity Movement, for she had a brother who was involved with that\nparty. In later years, I would tease her about this early allegiance, telling her that had she not met me, she would have married a leader of the NEUM.\nShortly after I filed for divorce from Evelyn, I told Winnie she should visit Ray Harmel, the wife of Michael Harmel, for a fitting for a wedding dress.\nIn addition to being an activist, Ray was an excellent dressmaker. I asked Winnie how many bridesmaids she intended to have, and suggested she\ngo to Bizana to inform her parents that we were to be married. Winnie has laughingly told people that I never proposed to her, but I always told her\nthat I asked her on our very first date and that I simply took it for granted from that day forward.\n\nThe Treason Trial was in its second year and it put a suffocating weight on our law practice. Mandela and Tambo was falling apart as we could not\nbe there, and both Oliver and I were experiencing grave financial difficulties. Since the charges against Oliver had been dropped, he was able to do\nsome remedial work; but the damage had already been done. We had gone from a bustling practice that turned people away to one that was\npractically begging for clients. I could not even afford to pay the fifty-pound balance still owing on the plot of land that I had purchased in Umtata, and\nhad to give it up.\nI explained all this to Winnie. I told her it was more than likely that we would have to live on her small salary as a social worker. Winnie understood\nand said she was prepared to take the risk and throw in her lot with me. I never promised her gold and diamonds, and I was never able to give her\nthem.\nThe wedding took place on June , . I applied for a relaxation of my banning orders and was given six days\u2019 leave of absence from\nJohannesburg. I also arranged for lobola, the traditional brideprice, to be paid to Winnie\u2019s father.\nThe wedding party left Johannesburg very early on the morning of June , and we arrived in Bizana late that afternoon. My first stop, as always\nwhen one was banned, was the police station to report that I had arrived. At dusk, we then went to the bride\u2019s place, Mbongweni, as was customary.\nWe were met by a great chorus of local women ululating with happiness, and Winnie and I were separated; she went to the bride\u2019s house, while I\nwent with the groom\u2019s party to the house of one of Winnie\u2019s relations.\nThe ceremony itself was at a local church, after which we celebrated at the home of Winnie\u2019s eldest brother, which was the ancestral home of the\nMadikizela clan. The bridal car was swathed in ANC colors. There was dancing and singing, and Winnie\u2019s exuberant grandmother did a special\ndance for all of us. The entire executive of the ANC had been invited, but bans limited their attendance. Among those who came were Duma\nNokwe, Lilian Ngoyi, Dr. James Njongwe, Dr. Wilson Conco, and Victor Tyamzashe.\nThe final reception was at the Bizana Town Hall. The speech I recall best was given by Winnie\u2019s father. He took note, as did everyone, that\namong the uninvited guests at the wedding were a number of security police. He spoke of his love for his daughter, my commitment to the country,\nand my dangerous career as a politician. When Winnie had first told him of the marriage, he had exclaimed, \u201cBut you are marrying a jailbird!\u201d At the\nwedding, he said he was not optimistic about the future, and that such a marriage, in such difficult times, would be unremittingly tested. He told\nWinnie she was marrying a man who was already married to the struggle. He bade his daughter good luck, and ended his speech by saying, \u201cIf\nyour man is a wizard, you must become a witch!\u201d It was a way of saying that you must follow your man on whatever path he takes. After that,\nConstance Mbekeni, my sister, spoke on my behalf at the ceremony.\nAfter the ceremony, a piece of the wedding cake was wrapped up for the bride to bring to the groom\u2019s ancestral home for the second part of the\nwedding. But it was never to be, for my leave of absence was up and we had to return to Johannesburg. Winnie carefully stored the cake in\nanticipation of that day. At our house, number  Orlando West, a large party of friends and family were there to welcome us back. A sheep had\nbeen slaughtered and there was a feast in our honor.\nThere was no time or money for a honeymoon, and life quickly settled into a routine dominated by the trial. We woke very early in the morning,\nusually at about four. Winnie prepared breakfast before I left. I would then take the bus to the trial, or make an early morning visit to my office. As\n\n\fmuch as possible, afternoons and evenings were spent at my office attempting to keep our practice going and to earn some money. Evenings were\noften taken up with political work and meetings. The wife of a freedom fighter is often like a widow, even when her husband is not in prison. Though I\nwas on trial for treason, Winnie gave me cause for hope. I felt as though I had a new and second chance at life. My love for her gave me added\nstrength for the struggles that lay ahead. THE MAJOR EVENT facing the country in  was the general election \u2014 \u201cgeneral\u201d only in the sense that three million whites could participate,\nbut none of the thirteen million Africans. We debated whether or not to stage a protest. The central issue was: Did an election in which only whites\ncould participate make any difference to Africans? The answer, as far as the ANC was concerned, was that we could not remain indifferent even\nwhen we were shut out of the process. We were excluded, but not unaffected: the defeat of the National Party would be in our interest and that of all\nAfricans.\nThe ANC joined with the other congresses and SACTU, the South African Congress of Trade Unions, to call a three-day strike during the\nelections in April. Leaflets were distributed in factories and shops, at railway stations and bus stops, in beer halls and hospitals, and from house to\nhouse. \u201cTHE NATS MUST GO!\u201d was the main slogan of this campaign. Our preparations worried the government; four days before the election, the\nstate ruled that a gathering of more than ten Africans in any urban area was illegal.\nThe night before a planned protest, boycott, or stay-away, the leaders of the event would go underground in order to foil the police swoop that\ninevitably took place. The police were not yet monitoring us around the clock and it was easy to disappear for a day or two. The night before the\nstrike, Walter, Oliver, Moses Kotane, J. B. Marks, Dan Tloome, Duma Nokwe, and I stayed in the house of Dr. Nthato Motlana, my physician, in\nOrlando. Very early the next morning, we moved to another house in the same neighborhood where we were able to keep in touch by telephone\nwith other leaders around the city. Communications were not very efficient in those days, particularly in the townships where few people owned\ntelephones, and it was a frustrating task to oversee a strike. We dispatched men to strategic places around the townships to watch the trains,\nbuses, and taxis in order to determine whether or not people were going to work. They returned with bad news: the buses and trains were filled;\npeople were ignoring the strike. Only then did we notice that the gentleman in whose house we were staying was nowhere to be found \u2014 he had\nslipped out and gone to work. The strike was shaping up as a failure.\nWe resolved to call off the strike. A three-day strike that is canceled on the first day is only a one-day failure; a strike that fails three days running\nis a fiasco. It was humiliating to have to retreat, but we felt that it would have been more humiliating not to. Less than one hour after we had released\na statement calling off the strike, the government-run South African Broadcasting Corporation read our announcement in full. Normally, the SABC\nignored the ANC altogether; only in defeat did we make their broadcasts. This time, they even complimented us on calling off the strike. This greatly\nannoyed Moses Kotane. \u201cTo be praised by the SABC, that is too much,\u201d he said, shaking his head. Kotane questioned whether we had acted too\nhastily and played into the state\u2019s hands. It was a legitimate concern, but decisions should not be taken out of pride or embarrassment, but out of\npure strategy \u2014 and strategy here suggested we call off the strike. The fact that the enemy had exploited our surrender didn\u2019t mean we were wrong\nto surrender.\nBut some areas did not hear that the strike was called off, while others spurned our call. In Port Elizabeth, an ANC stronghold, and other areas of\nthe Cape, the response was better on the second and third days than the first. In general, however, we could not hide the fact that the strike was a\nfailure. As if that were not enough, the Nationalists increased their popular vote in the election by more than  percent.\nWe had heated discussions about whether we ought to have relied on coercive measures. Should we have used pickets, which generally prevent\npeople from entering their place of work? The hard-liners suggested that if we had deployed pickets, the strike would have been a success. But I\nhave always resisted such methods. It is best to rely on the freely given support of the people; otherwise, that support is weak and fleeting. The\norganization should be a haven, not a prison. However, if the majority of the organization or the people support a decision, coercion can be used in\ncertain cases against the dissident minority in the interests of the majority. A minority, however vocal, should not be able to frustrate the will of the\nmajority.\nIn my own house, I attempted to use a different sort of coercion, but without success. Ida Mthimkhulu, a Sotho-speaking woman of my own age,\nwas then our house assistant. Ida was more a member of the family than an employee and I called her Kgaitsedi, which means \u201cSister\u201d and is a\nterm of endearment. Ida ran the house with military efficiency, and Winnie and I took our orders willingly; I often ran out to do errands at her\ncommand.\nThe day before the strike, I was driving Ida and her twelve-year-old son home, and I mentioned that I needed her to wash and press some shirts\nfor me the following day. A long and uncharacteristic silence followed. Ida then turned to me and said with barely concealed disdain, \u201cYou know very\nwell that I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I replied, surprised by the vehemence of her reaction.\n\u201cHave you forgotten that I, too, am a worker?\u201d she said with some satisfaction. \u201cI will be on strike tomorrow with my people and fellow workers!\u201d\nHer son saw my embarrassment and in his boyish way tried to ease the tension by saying that \u201cUncle Nelson\u201d had always treated her as a sister\nnot a worker. In irritation, she turned on her wellmeaning son and said, \u201cBoy, where were you when I was struggling for my rights in that house? If I\nhad not fought hard against your \u2018Uncle Nelson\u2019 I would not today be treated like a sister!\u201d Ida did not come to work the next day, and my shirts went\nunpressed. FOR SIX MONTHS \u2014 ever since the end of the preparatory hearings in January \u2014 we had been awaiting and preparing for our formal trial, which\nwas to commence in August . The government set up a special high court \u2014 Mr. Justice F. L. Rumpff, president of the three-man court, Mr.\nJustice Kennedy, and Mr. Justice Ludorf. The panel was not promising: it consisted of three white men, all with ties to the ruling party. While Judge\nRumpff was an able man and better informed than the average white South African, he was rumored to be a member of the Broederbond, a secret\nAfrikaner organization whose aim was to solidify Afrikaner power. Judge Ludorf was a well-known member of the National Party, as was Judge\nKennedy. Kennedy had a reputation as a hanging judge, having sent a group of twenty-three Africans to the gallows for the murder of two white\npolicemen.\nShortly before the case resumed, the state played another unpleasant trick on us. They announced that the venue of the trial was to be shifted\nfrom Johannesburg to Pretoria, thirty-six miles away. The trial would be conducted in an ornate former synagogue that had been converted into a\ncourt of law. All of the accused as well as our defense team resided in Johannesburg, so we would be forced to travel each day to Pretoria. The trial\nwould now take up even more of our time and money \u2014 neither of which we had in abundance. Those who had managed to keep their jobs had\nbeen able to do so because the court had been near their work. Changing the venue was also an attempt to crush our spirits by separating us from\nour natural supporters. Pretoria was the home of the National Party, and the ANC barely had a presence there.\nNearly all of the ninety-two accused commuted to Pretoria in a lumbering, uncomfortable bus, with stiff wooden slats for seats, which left every\nday at six in the morning and took two hours to reach the Old Synagogue. The round-trip took us nearly five hours \u2014 time far better spent earning\nmoney to pay for food, rent, and clothes for the children.\nOnce more we were privileged to have a brilliant and aggressive defense team, ably led by advocate Israel Maisels, and assisted by Bram\nFischer, Rex Welsh, Vernon Berrang\u00e9, Sydney Kentridge, Tony O\u2019Dowd, and G. Nicholas. On the opening day of the trial, they displayed their\ncombativeness with a risky legal maneuver that a number of us had decided on in consultation with the lawyers. Issy Maisels rose dramatically and\napplied for the recusal of Judges Ludorf and Rumpff on the grounds that both had conflicts of interest that prevented them from being fair arbiters of\nour case. There was an audible murmur in the courtroom. The defense contended that Rumpff, as the judge at the  Defiance Trial, had already\nadjudicated on certain aspects of the present indictment and therefore it was not in the interest of justice that he try this case. We argued that\nLudorf was prejudiced because he had represented the government in  as a lawyer for the police when Harold Wolpe had sought a court\ninterdict to eject the police from a meeting of the Congress of the People.\nThis was a dangerous strategy, for we could easily win this legal battle but lose the war. Although we regarded both Ludorf and Rumpff as strong\nsupporters of the National Party, there were far worse judges in the country who could replace them. In fact, while we were keen to have Ludorf step\ndown, we secretly hoped that Rumpff, whom we respected as an honest broker, would decide not to recuse himself. Rumpff always stood for law,\nno matter what his own political opinions might be, and we were convinced that when it came to law, we could only be found innocent.\nThat Monday, the atmosphere was expectant when the three red-robed judges marched into the courtroom. Judge Ludorf announced that he\nwould withdraw, adding that he had completely forgotten about the previous case. But Rumpff refused to recuse himself and instead offered the\nassurance that his judgment in the Defiance case would have no influence on him in this one. To replace Ludorf, the state appointed Mr. Justice\nBekker, a man we liked right from the start and who was not linked to the National Party. We were happy about Rumpff\u2019s decision.\nAfter the success of this first maneuver, we tried a second, nearly as risky. We began a long and detailed argument contesting the indictment\nitself. We claimed, among other things, that the indictment was vague and lacked particularity. We also argued that the planning of violence was\nnecessary to prove high treason, and the prosecution needed to provide examples of its claim that we intended to act violently. It became apparent\nby the end of our argument that the three judges agreed. In August, the court quashed one of the two charges under the Suppression of\nCommunism Act. On October , after two more months of legal wrangling, the Crown suddenly announced the withdrawal of the indictment\naltogether. This was extraordinary, but we were too well versed in the devious ways of the state to celebrate. A month later the prosecution issued a\nnew, more carefully worded indictment and announced that the trial would proceed against only thirty of the accused; the others would be tried later.\nI was among the first thirty, all of whom were members of the ANC.\nUnder the new indictment, the prosecution was now required to prove the intention to act violently. As Pirow put it, the accused knew that the\nachievement of the goals of the Freedom Charter would \u201cnecessarily involve the overthrow of the State by violence.\u201d The legal sparring continued\nthrough the middle of , when the court dismissed the Crown\u2019s indictment against the remaining sixty-one accused. For months on end, the\nactivity in the courtroom consisted of the driest legal maneuvering imaginable. Despite the defense\u2019s successes in showing the shoddiness of the\ngovernment\u2019s case, the state was obdurately persistent. As the minister of justice said, \u201cThis trial will be proceeded with, no matter how many\nmillions of pounds it costs. What does it matter how long it takes?\u201d\n* * *\nJust after midnight on the th of February, , I returned home after a meeting to find Winnie alone and in pain, about to go into labor. I rushed\nher to Baragwanath Hospital, but was told that it would be many hours before her time. I stayed until I had to leave for the trial in Pretoria.\nImmediately after the session ended, I speeded back with Duma Nokwe to find mother and daughter doing extremely well. I held my newborn\ndaughter in my arms and pronounced her a true Mandela. My relative, Chief Mdingi, suggested the name Zenani, which means \u201cWhat have you\nbrought to the world?\u201d \u2014 a poetic name that embodies a challenge, suggesting that one must contribute something to society. It is a name one\ndoes not simply possess, but has to live up to.\nMy mother came from the Transkei to help Winnie, and planned to give Zenani a Xhosa baptism by calling in an inyanga, a tribal healer, to give\nthe baby a traditional herbal bath. But Winnie was adamantly opposed, thinking it unhealthy and outdated, and instead smeared Zenani with olive\noil, plastered her little body with Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, and filled her stomach with shark oil.\nAs soon as Winnie was up and about, I undertook the task of teaching the new mother of the household how to drive. Driving, in those days, was\na man\u2019s business; very few women, especially African women, were to be seen in the driver\u2019s seat. But Winnie was independent-minded and intent\non learning, and it would be useful because I was gone so much of the time and could not drive her places myself. Perhaps I am an impatient\nteacher or perhaps I had a headstrong pupil, but when I attempted to give Winnie lessons along a relatively flat and quiet Orlando road, we could\nnot seem to shift gears without quarreling. Finally, after she had ignored one too many of my suggestions, I stormed out of the car and walked\nhome. Winnie seemed to do better without my tutelage than with it, for she proceeded to drive around the township on her own for the next hour. By\nthat time, we were ready to make up, and it is a story we subsequently laughed about.\nMarried life and motherhood were an adjustment for Winnie. She was then a young woman of twenty-five who had yet to form her own character\ncompletely. I was already formed and rather stubborn. I knew that others often saw her as \u201cMandela\u2019s wife.\u201d It was undoubtedly difficult for her to\n\n\fcreate her own identity in my shadow. I did my best to let her bloom in her own right, and she soon did so without any of my help.\n IN , Parliament passed the Promotion of Bantu Self Government Act, which created eight separate ethnic bantustans. This was the foundation\nof what the state called groot or grand apartheid. At roughly the same time, the government introduced the deceptively named Extension of\nUniversity Education Act, another leg of grand apartheid, which barred nonwhites from racially \u201copen\u201d universities. In introducing the Bantu Self\nGovernment Act, De Wet Nel, the minister of Bantu Administration and Development, said that the welfare of every individual and population group\ncould best be developed within its own national community. Africans, he said, could never be integrated into the white community.\nThe immorality of the bantustan policy, whereby  percent of the people would be apportioned only  percent of the land, was obvious. Under\nthe new policy, even though two-thirds of Africans lived in so-called white areas, they could only have citizenship in their own \u201ctribal homelands.\u201d The\nscheme gave us neither freedom in \u201cwhite\u201d areas nor independence in what they deemed \u201cour\u201d areas. Verwoerd said the creation of the bantustans\nwould engender so much goodwill that they would never become the breeding grounds of rebellion.\nIn reality, it was quite the opposite. The rural areas were in turmoil. Few areas fought so stubbornly as Zeerust, where Chief Abram Moilwa (with\nthe able assistance of advocate George Bizos) led his people to resist the so-called Bantu Authorities. Such areas were usually invisible to the\npress, and the government used their inaccessibility to veil the cruelty of the state\u2019s actions. Scores of innocent people were arrested, prosecuted,\njailed, banished, beaten, tortured, and murdered. The people of Sekhukhuneland also revolted, and the paramount chief, Moroamotsho\nSekhukhune, Godfrey Sekhukhune, and other counselors were banished or arrested. A Sekhukhune chief, Kolane Kgoloko, who was perceived as\na government lackey, was assassinated. By , resistance in Sekhukhuneland had reached open defiance, and people were refusing to pay\ntaxes.\nIn Zeerust and Sekhukhuneland, ANC branches played a prominent part in the protests. In spite of the severe repression, a number of new ANC\nbranches sprang up in the Zeerust area, one of them having recruited about two thousand members. Sekhukhuneland and Zeerust were the first\nareas in South Africa where the ANC was banned by the government, evidence of our power in these remote areas.\nProtest erupted in Eastern Pondoland, where government henchmen were assaulted and killed. Thembuland and Zululand fiercely resisted, and\nwere among the last areas to yield. People were beaten, arrested, deported, and imprisoned. In Thembuland, resistance had been going on since\n, with Sabata part of the forces of protest.\nIt was especially painful to me that in the Transkei, the wrath of the people was directed against my nephew and onetime mentor K. D.\nMatanzima. There was no doubt that Daliwonga was collaborating with the government. All the appeals I had made to him over the years had come\nto naught. There were reports that impis (traditional warriors) from Matanzima\u2019s headquarters had burned down villages that opposed him. There\nwere several assassination attempts against him. Equally painful was the fact that Winnie\u2019s father was serving on Matanzima\u2019s council and was an\nunwavering supporter. This was terribly difficult for Winnie: her father and her husband were on opposite sides of the same issue. She loved her\nfather, but she rejected his politics.\nOn a number of occasions, tribesmen and kinsmen from the Transkei visited me in Orlando to complain about chiefs collaborating with the\ngovernment. Sabata was opposed to the Bantu Authorities and would not capitulate, but my visitors were afraid that Matanzima would depose him,\nwhich is eventually what happened. At one time, Daliwonga himself came to visit during the Treason Trial and I brought him with me to Pretoria. In\nthe courtroom, Issy Maisels introduced him to the judges and they accorded him a seat of honor. But outside \u2014 among the accused \u2014 he was not\ntreated so deferentially. He began aggressively to ask the various defendants, who regarded him as a sellout, why they objected to separate\ndevelopment. Lilian Ngoyi remarked: \u201cTyhini, uyadelela lo mntu\u201d (Gracious, this man is provocative). THE DECEMBER  ANC annual conference was held in Durban during that city\u2019s dynamic antipass demonstrations. The conference\nunanimously voted to initiate a massive countrywide antipass campaign beginning March  and climaxing on June  with a great bonfire of\npasses.\nThe planning began immediately. On March , deputations were sent to local authorities. ANC officials toured the country, talking to the\nbranches about the campaign. ANC field-workers spread the word in townships and factories. Leaflets, stickers, and posters were printed and\ncirculated and posted in trains and buses.\nThe mood of the country was grim. The state was threatening to ban the organization, with cabinet ministers warning the ANC that it would soon\nbe battered with \u201can ungloved fist.\u201d Elsewhere in Africa, the freedom struggle was marching on: the emergence of the independent republic of\nGhana in  and its pan-Africanist, anti-apartheid leader, Kwame Nkrumah, had alarmed the Nationalists and made them even more intent on\nclamping down on dissent at home. In , seventeen former colonies in Africa were scheduled to become independent states. In February,\nBritish Prime Minister Harold Macmillan visited South Africa and gave a speech before Parliament in which he talked of \u201cwinds of change\u201d\nsweeping Africa.\nThe PAC at the time appeared lost; they were a leadership in search of followers, and they had yet to initiate any action that put them on the\npolitical map. They knew of the ANC\u2019s antipass campaign and had been invited to join, but instead of linking arms with the Congress movement,\nthey sought to sabotage us. The PAC announced that it was launching its own antipass campaign on March , ten days before ours was to begin.\nNo conference had been held by them to discuss the date, no organizational work of any significance had been undertaken. It was a blatant case of\nopportunism. Their actions were motivated more by a desire to eclipse the ANC than to defeat the enemy.\nFour days before the scheduled demonstration, Sobukwe invited us to join with the PAC. Sobukwe\u2019s offer was not a gesture of unity but a tactical\nmove to prevent the PAC from being criticized for not including us. He made the offer at the eleventh hour, and we declined to participate. On the\nmorning of March , Sobukwe and his executive walked to the Orlando police station to turn themselves in for arrest. The tens of thousands of\npeople going to work ignored the PAC men. In the magistrate\u2019s court, Sobukwe announced the PAC would not attempt to defend itself, in\naccordance with their slogan \u201cNo bail, no defense, no fine.\u201d They believed the defiers would receive sentences of a few weeks. But Sobukwe was\nsentenced not to three weeks\u2019 but to three years\u2019 imprisonment without the option of a fine.\nThe response to the PAC\u2019s call in Johannesburg was minimal. No demonstrations at all took place in Durban, Port Elizabeth, or East London.\nBut in Evaton, Z. B. Molete, ably assisted by Joe Molefi and Vusumuzi Make, mustered the support of the entire township as several hundred men\npresented themselves for arrest without passes. Cape Town saw one of the biggest antipass demonstrations in the history of the city. In Langa\ntownship, outside Cape Town, some thirty thousand people, led by the young student Philip Kgosana, gathered and were spurred to rioting by a\npolice baton-charge. Two people were killed. But the last of the areas where demonstrations took place was the most calamitous and the one\nwhose name still echoes with tragedy: Sharpeville.\nSharpeville was a small township about thirty-five miles south of Johannesburg in the grim industrial complex around Vereeniging. PAC activists\nhad done an excellent job of organizing the area. In the early afternoon, a crowd of several thousand surrounded the police station. The\ndemonstrators were controlled and unarmed. The police force of seventy-five was greatly outnumbered and panicky. No one heard warning shots or\nan order to shoot, but suddenly, the police opened fire on the crowd and continued to shoot as the demonstrators turned and ran in fear. When the\narea had cleared, sixty-nine Africans lay dead, most of them shot in the back as they were fleeing. All told, more than seven hundred shots had\nbeen fired into the crowd, wounding more than four hundred people, including dozens of women and children. It was a massacre, and the next day\npress photos displayed the savagery on front pages around the world.\nThe shootings at Sharpeville provoked national turmoil and a government crisis. Outraged protests came in from across the globe, including one\nfrom the American State Department. For the first time, the U.N. Security Council intervened in South African affairs, blaming the government for\nthe shootings and urging it to initiate measures to bring about racial equality. The Johannesburg stock exchange plunged and capital started to flow\nout of the country. South African whites began making plans to emigrate. Liberals urged Verwoerd to offer concessions to Africans. The\ngovernment insisted Sharpeville was the result of a Communist conspiracy.\nThe massacre at Sharpeville created a new situation in the country. In spite of the amateurishness and opportunism of their leaders, the PAC\nrank and file displayed great courage and fortitude in their demonstrations at Sharpeville and Langa. In just one day, they had moved to the front\nlines of the struggle, and Robert Sobukwe was being hailed inside and outside the country as the savior of the liberation movement. We in the ANC\nhad to make rapid adjustments to this new situation, and we did so.\nA small group of us \u2014 Walter, Duma Nokwe, Joe Slovo, and myself \u2014 held an all-night meeting in Johannesburg to plan a response. We knew\nwe had to acknowledge the events in some way and give the people an outlet for their anger and grief. We conveyed our plans to Chief Luthuli, and\nhe readily accepted them. On March , in Pretoria, the chief publicly burned his pass, calling on others to do the same. He announced a\nnationwide stay-at-home on March , a national Day of Mourning and protest for the atrocities at Sharpeville. In Orlando, Duma Nokwe and I then\nburned our passes before hundreds of people and dozens of press photographers.\nTwo days later, on the twenty-eighth, the country responded magnificently as several hundred thousand Africans observed the chief\u2019s call. Only a\ntruly mass organization could coordinate such activities, and the ANC did so. In Cape Town a crowd of fifty thousand met in Langa township to\nprotest the shootings. Rioting broke out in many areas. The government declared a State of Emergency, suspending habeas corpus and assuming\nsweeping powers to act against all forms of subversion. South Africa was now under martial law. AT : IN THE MORNING, on March , I was awakened by sharp, unfriendly knocks at my door, the unmistakable signature of the police. \u201cThe\ntime has come,\u201d I said to myself as I opened the door to find half-a-dozen armed security policemen. They turned the house upside down, taking\nvirtually every piece of paper they could find, including the transcripts I had recently been making of my mother\u2019s recollections of family history and\ntribal fables. I was never to see them again. I was then arrested without a warrant, and given no opportunity to call my lawyer. They refused to inform\nmy wife as to where I was to be taken. I simply nodded at Winnie; it was no time for words of comfort.\nThirty minutes later we arrived at Newlands police station, which was familiar to me from the many occasions when I had visited clients there. The\nstation was located in Sophiatown, or rather, what was left of it, for the once bustling township was now a ruin of bulldozed buildings and vacant lots.\nInside I found a number of my colleagues who had been similarly rousted out of bed, and over the course of the night, more arrived; by morning we\ntotaled forty in all. We were put in a cramped yard with only the sky as a roof and a dim bulb for light, a space so small and dank that we remained\nstanding all night.\nAt :, we were taken into a tiny cell with a single drainage hole in the floor which could be flushed only from the outside. We were given no\nblankets, no food, no mats, and no toilet paper. The hole regularly became blocked and the stench in the room was insufferable. We issued\nnumerous protests, among them the demand to be fed. These were met with surly rejoinders, and we resolved that the next time the door opened,\nwe would surge out into the adjacent courtyard and refuse to return to the cell until we had been fed. The young policeman on duty took fright and left\nas we stampeded through the door. A few minutes later, a burly no-nonsense sergeant entered the courtyard and commanded us to return to the\ncell. \u201cGo inside!\u201d he yelled. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll bring in fifty men with batons and we\u2019ll break your skulls!\u201d After the horrors of Sharpeville, the threat did\nnot seem empty.\nThe station commander approached the gate of the courtyard to observe us, and then came over and berated me for standing with my hands in\nmy pockets. \u201cIs that the way you act around an officer?\u201d he yelled. \u201cTake your bloody hands out of your pockets!\u201d I kept my hands firmly rooted in my\npockets as if I were taking a walk on a chilly day. I told him that I might condescend to remove my hands if we were fed.\nAt  P.M., more than twelve hours after most of us had arrived, we were delivered a container of thin mealie pap and no utensils. Normally, I would\nhave considered this unfit for consumption, but we reached in with our unwashed hands and ate as though we had been provided with the most\ndelicious delicacies under the sun. After our meal, we elected a committee to represent us, which included Duma Nokwe and Z. B. Molete, the\npublicity secretary of the Pan Africanist Congress, and me. I was elected spokesman. We immediately drew up a petition protesting the unfit\nconditions and demanding our immediate release on the grounds that our detention was illegal.\nAt six o\u2019clock we received sleeping mats and blankets. I do not think words can do justice to a description of the foulness and filthiness of this\nbedding. The blankets were encrusted with dried blood and vomit, ridden with lice, vermin, and cockroaches, and reeked with a stench that actually\ncompeted with the odiousness of the drain.\nNear midnight, we were told we were to be called out, but for what we did not know. Some of the men smiled at the expectation of release.\nOthers knew better. I was the first to be called and I was ushered over to the front gate of the prison where I was briefly released in front of a group\nof police officers. But before I could move, an officer shouted.\n\u201cName!\u201d\n\u201cMandela,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNelson Mandela,\u201d the officer said, \u201cI arrest you under the powers vested in me by the Emergency Regulations.\u201d We were not to be released at\nall, but rearrested under the terms of what we only then discovered was a State of Emergency. Each of us in turn was released for mere seconds,\nand then rearrested. We had been arrested illegally before the State of Emergency; now we were being properly arrested under the State of\nEmergency that came into force at midnight. We drafted a memorandum to the commander asking to know our rights.\nThe next morning, I was called to the commander\u2019s office, where I found my colleague Robert Resha, who had been arrested and was being\ninterrogated by the station commander. When I walked into the room, Resha asked the commander why he had erupted at me the previous night.\nHis answer was that of the typical white baas: \u201cMandela was cheeky.\u201d I responded, \u201cI\u2019m not bound to take my hands out of my pockets for the likes\nof you, then or now.\u201d The commander jumped out of his chair, but was restrained by other officers. At this moment, Special Branch Detective\nSergeant Helberg entered the office and said, \u201cHello, Nelson!\u201d in a pleasant way. To which I shot back, \u201cI am not Nelson to you, I am Mr. Mandela.\u201d\nThe room was on the brink of becoming a full-scale battle when we were informed that we had to leave to attend the Treason Trial in Pretoria. I did\nnot know whether to laugh or despair, but in the midst of this thirty-six hours of mistreatment and the declaration of a State of Emergency, the\ngovernment still saw fit to bring us back to Pretoria to continue their desperate and now seemingly outdated case against us. We were taken\nstraight to Pretoria Local Prison, where we were detained.",
    "1960-1966": " ON APRIL , , on the anniversary of Jan Van Riebeeck\u2019s landing at the Cape, a new organization was born that sought to rival the ANC as the\ncountry\u2019s premier African political organization and repudiate the white domination that began three centuries before. With a few hundred\ndelegates from around the country at the Orlando Communal Hall, the Pan Africanist Congress launched itself as an Africanist organization that\nexpressly rejected the multiracialism of the ANC. Like those of us who had formed the Youth League fifteen years before, the founders of the new\norganization thought the ANC was insufficiently militant, out of touch with the masses, and dominated by non-Africans.\nRobert Sobukwe was elected president and Potlako Leballo became national secretary, both of them former ANC Youth Leaguers. The PAC\npresented a manifesto and a constitution, along with Sobukwe\u2019s opening address, in which he called for a \u201cgovernment of the Africans by the\nAfricans and for the Africans.\u201d The PAC declared that they intended to overthrow white supremacy and establish a government Africanist in origin,\nsocialist in content, and democratic in form. They disavowed communism in all its forms and considered whites and Indians \u201cforeign minority\ngroups\u201d or \u201caliens\u201d who had no natural place in South Africa. South Africa was for Africans, and no one else.\nThe birth of the PAC did not come as a surprise to us. The Africanists within the ANC had been loudly voicing their grievances for more than\nthree years. In , the Africanists had called for a vote of no confidence in the Transvaal executive at the national conference, but had been\ndefeated. They had opposed the election day stay-at-home of , and their leader, Potlako Leballo, had been expelled from the ANC. At the\nNovember  ANC conference, a group of Africanists had declared their opposition to the Freedom Charter, claiming it violated the principles of\nAfrican nationalism.\nThe PAC claimed that they drew their inspiration from the principles surrounding the ANC\u2019s founding in , but their views derived principally\nfrom the emotional African nationalism put forth by Anton Lembede and A. P. Mda during the founding of the Youth League in . The PAC\nechoed the axioms and slogans of that time: Africa for the Africans and a United States of Africa. But the immediate cause for their breakaway was\ntheir objection to the Freedom Charter and the presence of whites and Indians in the Congress Alliance leadership. They were opposed to\ninterracial cooperation, in large part because they believed that white Communists and Indians had come to dominate the ANC.\nThe founders of the PAC were all well known to me. Robert Sobukwe was an old friend. He was the proverbial gentleman and scholar (his\ncolleagues called him \u201cProf\u201d). His consistent willingness to pay the penalty for his principles earned my enduring respect. Potlako Leballo, Peter\nRaboroko, and Zephania Mothopeng were all friends and colleagues. I was astonished and indeed somewhat dismayed to learn that my political\nmentor Gaur Radebe had joined the PAC. I found it curious that a former member of the Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee had decided to\nalign himself with an organization that then explicitly rejected Marxism.\nMany of those who cast their lot with the PAC did so out of personal grudges or disappointments and were not thinking of the advancement of the\nstruggle, but of their own feelings of jealousy or revenge. I have always believed that to be a freedom fighter one must suppress many of the\npersonal feelings that make one feel like a separate individual rather than part of a mass movement. One is fighting for the liberation of millions of\npeople, not the glory of one individual. I am not suggesting that a man become a robot and rid himself of all personal feelings and motivations. But\nin the same way that a freedom fighter subordinates his own family to the family of the people, he must subordinate his own individual feelings to\nthe movement.\nI found the views and the behavior of the PAC immature. A philosopher once noted that something is odd if a person is not liberal when he is\nyoung and conservative when he is old. I am not a conservative, but one matures and regards some of the views of one\u2019s youth as undeveloped and\ncallow. While I sympathized with the views of the Africanists and once shared many of them, I believed that the freedom struggle required one to\nmake compromises and accept the kind of discipline that one resisted as a younger, more impulsive man.\nThe PAC put forward a dramatic and overambitious program that promised quick solutions. Their most dramatic \u2014 and na\u00efve \u2014 promise was\nthat liberation would be achieved by the end of , and they urged Africans to ready themselves for that historic hour. \u201cIn  we take our first\nstep,\u201d they promised, \u201cin , our last towards freedom and independence.\u201d Although this prediction inspired hope and enthusiasm among people\nwho were tired of waiting, it is always dangerous for an organization to make promises it cannot keep.\nBecause of the PAC\u2019s anticommunism, they became the darlings of the Western press and the American State Department, which hailed its\nbirth as a dagger to the heart of the African left. Even the National Party saw a potential ally in the PAC: they viewed the PAC as mirroring their\nanticommunism and supporting their views on separate development. The Nationalists also rejected interracial cooperation, and both the National\nParty and the American State Department saw fit to exaggerate the size and importance of the new organization for their own ends.\nWhile we welcomed anyone brought into the struggle by the PAC, the role of the organization was almost always that of a spoiler. They divided\nthe people at a critical moment, and that was hard to forget. They would ask the people to go to work when we called a general strike, and make\nmisleading statements to counter any pronouncement we would make. Yet the PAC aroused in me the hope that even though the founders were\nbreakaway ANC men, unity between our two groups was possible. I thought that once the heated polemics had cooled, the essential commonality\nof the struggle would bring us together. Animated by this belief, I paid particular attention to their policy statement and activities, with the idea of\nfinding affinities rather than differences.\nThe day after the PAC\u2019s inaugural conference, I approached Sobukwe for a copy of his presidential address, as well as the constitution and other\npolicy material. Sobukwe, I thought, seemed pleased by my interest, and said he would make sure I received the requested material. I saw him\nagain not long afterward and reminded him of my request and he said the material was on its way. I subsequently met Potlako Leballo and said,\n\u201cMan, you chaps keep promising me your material, but no one has given it to me.\u201d He said, \u201cNelson, we have decided not to give it to you because\nwe know you only want to use it to attack us.\u201d I disabused him of this notion, and he relented, giving me all that I had sought.\n PRISON NOT ONLY robs you of your freedom, it attempts to take away your identity. Everyone wears the same uniform, eats the same food,\nfollows the same schedule. It is by definition a purely authoritarian state that tolerates no independence or individuality. As a freedom fighter and as\na man, one must fight against the prison\u2019s attempt to rob one of these qualities.\nFrom the courthouse, I was taken directly to Pretoria Local, the gloomy red-brick monstrosity that I knew so well. But I was now a convicted\nprisoner, not an awaiting-trial prisoner, and was treated without even that little deference that is afforded to the latter. I was stripped of my clothes\nand Colonel Jacobs was finally able to confiscate my kaross. I was issued the standard prison uniform for Africans: a pair of short trousers, a rough\nkhaki shirt, a canvas jacket, socks, sandals, and a cloth cap. Only Africans are given short trousers, for only African men are deemed \u201cboys\u201d by the\nauthorities.\nI informed the authorities that I would under no circumstances wear shorts and told them I was prepared to go to court to protest. Later, when I\nwas brought dinner, stiff cold porridge with a half teaspoonful of sugar, I refused to eat it. Colonel Jacobs pondered this and came up with a\nsolution: I could wear long trousers and have my own food, if I agreed to be put in isolation. \u201cWe were going to put you with the other politicals,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cbut now you will be alone, man. I hope you enjoy it.\u201d I assured him that solitary confinement would be fine as long as I could wear and eat what\nI chose.\n\nFor the next few weeks, I was completely and utterly isolated. I did not see the face or hear the voice of another prisoner. I was locked up for twentythree hours a day, with thirty minutes of exercise in the morning and again in the afternoon. I had never been in isolation before, and every hour\nseemed like a year. There was no natural light in my cell; a single bulb burned overhead twenty-four hours a day. I did not have a wristwatch and I\noften thought it was the middle of the night when it was only late afternoon. I had nothing to read, nothing to write on or with, no one to talk to. The\nmind begins to turn in on itself, and one desperately wants something outside of oneself on which to fix one\u2019s attention. I have known men who took\nhalf-a-dozen lashes in preference to being locked up alone. After a time in solitary, I relished the company even of the insects in my cell, and found\nmyself on the verge of initiating conversations with a cockroach.\nI had one middle-aged African warder whom I occasionally was able to see, and one day I tried to bribe him with an apple to get him to talk to\nme. \u201cBaba,\u201d I said, which means Father, and is a term of respect, \u201ccan I give you an apple?\u201d He turned away, and met all my subsequent overtures\nwith silence. Finally, he said, \u201cMan, you wanted long trousers and better food, and now you have them and you are still not happy.\u201d He was right.\nNothing is more dehumanizing than the absence of human companionship. After a few weeks, I was ready to swallow my pride and tell Colonel\nJacobs that I would trade my long trousers for some company.\nDuring those weeks I had plenty of time to ponder my fate. The place of a freedom fighter is beside his people, not behind bars. The knowledge\nand contacts I had recently made in Africa were going to be locked away rather than used in the struggle. I cursed the fact that my expertise would\nnot be put to use in creating a freedom army.\nI soon began to protest vigorously against my circumstances and demanded to be put with the other political prisoners at Pretoria Local. Among\nthem was Robert Sobukwe. My request was ultimately granted, accompanied by a stern warning from Colonel Jacobs that serious consequences\nwould result if I returned to my impudent ways. I don\u2019t think I ever looked forward to eating cold mealie pap so much in my life.\n\nApart from my desire for company, I was keen to talk with Sobukwe and the others, most of whom were PAC, because I thought that in prison we\nmight forge a unity that we could not on the outside. Prison conditions have a way of tempering polemics, and making individuals see more what\nunites them than what divides them.\nWhen I was taken to the courtyard with the others, we greeted each other warmly. Besides Sobukwe, there was also John Gaetsewe, a leading\nmember of the South African Congress of Trade Unions; Aaron Molete, an ANC member who worked for New Age; and Stephen Tefu, a prominent\nCommunist, trade unionist, and PAC member. Robert asked me to give them an account of my African tour, which I did gladly. I was candid about\nhow both the PAC and the ANC were perceived in the rest of Africa. At the end of my narrative I said there were issues that I wanted us to examine.\nBut after initially allowing Sobukwe and me a certain proximity, the authorities took pains to keep us apart. We lived in single cells along a corridor\nand he and I were given cells at opposite ends.\nOccasionally, we did have a chance to talk as we sat next to each other on the ground of the prison courtyard sewing and patching up shabby old\nmailbags. I have always respected Sobukwe, and found him a balanced and reasonable man. But we differed markedly about the principal subject\nat hand: prison conditions. Sobukwe believed that to fight poor conditions would be to acknowledge the state\u2019s right to have him in prison in the first\nplace. I responded that it was always unacceptable to live in degrading conditions and that political prisoners throughout history had considered it\npart of their duty to fight to improve prison conditions. Sobukwe responded that prison conditions would not change until the country changed. I\ncompletely agreed with this, but I did not see why that ought to prevent us from fighting in the only realm in which we now could fight. We never\nresolved this issue, but we did make some progress when we submitted a joint letter to the commanding officer setting out our complaints about\nprison conditions.\nSobukwe never broke in prison. But in Pretoria he was a bit sensitive and testy, and I attribute this to Stephen Tefu. Tefu had become a kind of\ngoad to Sobukwe, teasing, taunting, and challenging him. Even at the best of times, Tefu was a difficult fellow: dyspeptic, argumentative,\noverbearing. He was also articulate, knowledgeable, and an expert in Russian history. Above all, he was a fighter, but he would fight everyone, even\nhis friends. Tefu and Sobukwe quarreled every day.\nI was keen to discuss policy issues with Sobukwe, and one of the matters I took up with him was the PAC slogan \u201cFreedom in .\u201d It was\nalready  and freedom was nowhere to be seen. \u201cMy brother,\u201d I said to Sobukwe, \u201cthere is nothing so dangerous as a leader making a demand\nthat he knows cannot be achieved. It creates false hopes among the people.\u201d\nI said this in a most respectful manner, but Tefu jumped in and started to berate Sobukwe. \u201cBob,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have met your match with\nMandela. You know he is right.\u201d Tefu continued in this vein, annoying Sobukwe to the point where he would tell Tefu, \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d But Tefu\nwould not stop. \u201cBob, the people are waiting for you. They are going to kill you because you have deceived them. You are just an amateur, Bob. You\nare not a real politician.\u201d\nTefu did his best to alienate me as well. Every morning, when we were visited by the warders, he would complain to them about something \u2014 the\nfood, the conditions, the heat or the cold. One day, an officer said to Tefu: \u201cLook, man, why do you complain every morning?\u201d\n\n\f\u201cI complain because it is my duty to complain,\u201d Steve said.\n\u201cBut, look at Mandela,\u201d the officer said, \u201che does not complain every day.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Tefu with disgust, \u201cMandela is a little boy who is afraid of the white man. I don\u2019t even know who he is. One morning, I woke up and\nfound every newspaper saying, \u2018Mandela, Mandela, Mandela,\u2019 and I said to myself, \u2018Who is this Mandela?\u2019 I will tell you who Mandela is. He is a\nchap built up by you people for some reason that I don\u2019t understand. That is who Mandela is!\u201d\n* * *\nWe were joined for two weeks by Walter, who had been on trial in Johannesburg for incitement to strike while I had been in Pretoria. He was\nsentenced to six years. We had a number of opportunities to talk in jail and we discussed Walter\u2019s application for bail while his appeal was\npending, a move I wholeheartedly supported. After two weeks he was released on bail, and he was instructed by the movement to go underground,\nfrom where he was to continue to lead the struggle, which he ably did.\nNot long after Walter left, I was walking to the prison hospital with Sobukwe when I spotted Nana Sita in the courtyard about twenty-five yards\naway. Sita, the distinguished Indian campaigner who had led our defiance at Boksburg in , had just been convicted by a Pretoria magistrate\nfor refusing to vacate his house \u2014 the house he had lived in for more than forty years \u2014 which was in a precinct that had been proclaimed \u201cwhite\u201d in\nterms of the Group Areas Act. He was hunched over, and the fact that he was barefoot despite an acute arthritic condition made me uncomfortable\nin my own sandals. I wanted to go over to greet him, but we were marching under the eyes of a half-dozen warders.\nSuddenly and without warning, I suffered a blackout. I crumpled to the concrete and sustained a deep gash above my left eye, which required\nthree stitches. I had been diagnosed back in the Fort with high blood pressure and had been given certain pills. The cause of the blackout was\nevidently an overdose of these pills; I was taken off them, and put on a low-salt diet, which solved the problem.\nThat afternoon was my first scheduled visit from Winnie since I had been sentenced. Stitches or no stitches, I was not going to miss it. She was\nextremely concerned when she saw me but I assured her I was fine and explained what happened. Even so, rumors circulated that my health had\nbroken down.\n IN OCTOBER , during my trial, the ANC held its first annual conference since . Because the organization was illegal, the conference took\nplace in Lobatse, just over the border in Bechuanaland. The conference was a milestone, for it explicitly linked the ANC and MK. Although the\nNational Executive Committee stated, \u201cOur emphasis still remains mass political action,\u201d Umkhonto was referred to as the \u201cmilitary wing of our\nstruggle.\u201d This was done in part to try to quell the more irresponsible acts of terrorism then being committed by Poqo. Poqo, Xhosa for\n\u201cindependent\u201d or \u201cstanding alone,\u201d was loosely linked to the PAC, and their acts of terrorism targeted both African collaborators and whites. The\nANC wanted the people to see its new militancy, but also to see that it was controlled and responsible.\nThe government had decided to accelerate the program of \u201cseparate development\u201d to show the world that apartheid allowed races their\nindividual \u201cfreedom.\u201d The prototype would be the Transkei. In January , Verwoerd had announced that South Africa intended to grant the\nTranskei \u201cself-government.\u201d In , the Transkei became a \u201cself-governing\u201d homeland. In November , an election was held for the Transkei\nlegislative assembly. But by a margin of more than three to one, Transkei voters elected members opposed to the homeland policy.\nThe bantustan system was nevertheless instituted; the voters had opposed it, but participated in it simply by voting. Though I abhorred the\nbantustan system, I felt the ANC should use both the system and those within it as a platform for our policies, particularly as so many of our leaders\nwere now voiceless through imprisonment, banning, or exile.\nTerrorism against the Bantu Authorities increased. As acts of sabotage mounted, so did the government\u2019s vigilance. John Vorster, the new\nminister of justice, who had himself been detained during World War II for opposing the government\u2019s support of the Allies, was a man\nunsentimental in the extreme. For him, the iron fist was the best and only answer to subversion.\nOn May , , the government enacted legislation designed \u201cto break the back\u201d of Umkhonto, as Vorster put it. The General Law Amendment\nAct, better known as the Ninety-Day Detention Law, waived the right of habeas corpus and empowered any police officer to detain any person\nwithout a warrant on grounds of suspicion of a political crime. Those arrested could be detained without trial, charge, access to a lawyer, or\nprotection against self-incrimination for up to ninety days. The ninety-day detention could be extended, as Vorster ominously explained, until \u201cthis\nside of eternity.\u201d The law helped transform the country into a police state; no dictator could covet more power than the Ninety-Day Detention Law\ngave to the authorities. As a result, the police became more savage: prisoners were routinely beaten and we soon heard reports of electric shock,\nsuffocation, and other forms of torture. In Parliament, Helen Suzman, the representative of the liberal Progressive Party, cast the lone vote against\nthe act.\nIncreased penalties were ordered for membership in illegal organizations; sentences from five years to the death penalty were instituted for\n\u201cfurthering the aims\u201d of communism or of other banned organizations. Political prisoners were redetained as I found out in May , when\nSobukwe\u2019s three-year sentence was up; instead of releasing him, the government simply redetained him without charging him, and then sent him to\nRobben Island.\nVorster also championed the Sabotage Act of June , which allowed for house arrests and more stringent bannings not subject to challenge\nin the court, restricting the liberties of citizens to those in the most extreme fascist dictatorships. Sabotage itself now carried a minimum penalty of\nfive years without parole and a maximum of death. Because the wording of the act was so broad, even activities such as trespassing or illegal\npossession of weapons could constitute sabotage. Another act of Parliament prohibited the reproduction of any statement made by a banned\nperson. Nothing I said or had ever said could be reported in the newspapers. New Age was banned at the end of , and possession of a\nbanned publication became a criminal offense, punishable by up to two years in prison. Provision was also made for house arrest, the most wellknown use of which was imposed on the white political activist Helen Joseph. ON OCTOBER , , we were picked up in a heavily fortified police van. It had a steel divider running along the center, segregating the white\nprisoners from the Africans. We were driven to the Palace of Justice in Pretoria, where the Supreme Court sits, for the opening of The State versus\nthe National High Command and others, what later became known as The State versus Nelson Mandela and others, and is still better known as\nthe Rivonia Trial. Near the court stands a statue of Paul Kruger, the president of the Republic of the Transvaal who fought against British\nimperialism in the nineteenth century. Underneath this Afrikaner hero is a quotation from one of his speeches. The inscription reads, \u201cIn confidence\nwe lay our cause before the whole world. Whether we win or whether we die, freedom will rise in Africa like the sun from the morning clouds.\u201d\nOur van was in the center of a convoy of police trucks. At the front of this motorcade were limousines carrying high police officials. The Palace of\nJustice was teeming with armed policemen. To avoid the enormous crowd of our supporters, who had grouped in front of the building, we were\ndriven into the rear of the building and taken in through great iron gates. All around the building police officers with machine guns stood at attention.\nAs we descended from the van, we could hear the great crowd singing and chanting. Once inside, we were held in cells below the courtroom before\nthe opening of what was depicted in the newspapers at home and around the world as the most significant political trial in the history of South\nAfrica.\n\nAs we emerged from the cells, each of the accused was accompanied by two armed warders. When we entered the ornate, high-ceilinged\ncourtroom, we each turned to the crowd and made a clenched-fist ANC salute. In the visitors\u2019 gallery our supporters shouted \u201cAmandla! Ngawethu!\u201d\nand \u201cMayibuye Afrika!\u201d This was inspiring, but dangerous: the police took the names and addresses of all the spectators in the galleries, and\nphotographed them as they left the court. The courtroom was filled with domestic and international journalists, and dozens of representatives of\nforeign governments.\nAfter we filed in, a group of police officers formed a tight cordon between us and the spectators. I was disgusted to have to appear in court\nwearing my prison clothes of khaki shorts and flimsy sandals. As a convicted prisoner, I did not have the choice of wearing proper clothes. Many\npeople later commented on how poorly I looked, and not just because of my wardrobe. I had been in and out of solitary confinement for months and I\nhad lost more than twenty-five pounds. I took pains to smile at the gallery when I walked into the courtroom, and seeing our supporters was the best\nmedicine I could have had.\nSecurity was particularly tight as only a few weeks before Arthur Goldreich, Harold Wolpe, Mosie Moola, and Abdulhay Jassat had bribed a\nyoung guard and escaped from jail. Arthur and Harold made their way to Swaziland disguised as priests, then flew to Tanganyika. Their escape\ncame at a time of hysteria about the underground and was greeted with blaring newspaper headlines. It was an embarrassment to the government\nand a boost to our morale.\nOur judge in the Rivonia Trial was Mr. Quartus de Wet, judge-president of the Transvaal, who sat in his flowing red robes beneath a wooden\ncanopy. De Wet was one of the last judges appointed by the United Party before the Nationalists came to power and was not considered a\ngovernment lackey. He was a poker-faced judge who did not suffer fools gladly. The prosecutor was Dr. Percy Yutar, deputy attorney general of the\nTransvaal, whose ambition was to become attorney general of South Africa. He was a small, bald, dapper fellow, whose voice squeaked when he\nbecame angry or emotional. He had a flair for the dramatic and for high-flown if imprecise language.\nYutar rose and addressed the court: \u201cMy Lord, I call the case of the state against the National High Command and others.\u201d I was accused number\none. Yutar handed in the indictment and authorized that we be charged immediately and tried summarily. This was the first time we were given a\ncopy of the indictment. The prosecution had kept it from us, though they gave it to the Rand Daily Mail, which had splashed it all over that day\u2019s\nedition of the paper. The indictment charged eleven of us with complicity in over two hundred acts of sabotage aimed at facilitating violent\nrevolution and an armed invasion of the country. The state contended that we were actors in a conspiracy to overthrow the government.\nWe were charged with sabotage and conspiracy rather than high treason because the law does not require a long preparatory examination\n(which is highly useful to the defense) for sabotage and conspiracy as it does for treason. Yet the supreme penalty \u2014 death by hanging \u2014 is the\nsame. With high treason, the state must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and needs two witnesses to testify to each charge. Under the\nSabotage Law, the onus was on the defense to prove the accused innocent.\nBram Fischer stood up and asked the court for a remand on the grounds that the defense had not had time to prepare its case. He noted that a\nnumber of the accused had been held in solitary confinement for unconscionable lengths of time. The state had been preparing for three months,\nbut we had only received the indictment that day. Justice de Wet gave us a three-week adjournment until October .\nI was disturbed to discover that first day that Winnie was unable to attend. Because of her banning and her restriction to Johannesburg, she\nneeded police permission to come to court. She had applied and been refused. I also learned that our house had been raided and the police had\ndetained a young relative of Winnie\u2019s. Winnie was not the only wife being harassed. Albertina Sisulu and Caroline Motsoaledi were detained under\nthe Ninety-Day Detention Act, and Walter\u2019s young son Max was also arrested. This was one of the state\u2019s most barbarous techniques of applying\npressure: imprisoning the wives and children of freedom fighters. Many men in prison were able to handle anything the authorities did to them, but\nthe thought of the state doing the same thing to their families was almost impossible to bear.\nWinnie subsequently appealed to the minister of justice, who granted her permission to attend the trial on the condition that she did not wear\ntraditional dress. Ironically, the same government that was telling us to embrace our culture in the homelands forbade Winnie from wearing a Xhosa\ngown into court.\n\nDuring the next three weeks, we were permitted to spend our days together preparing our case. I was now among my fellow accused, and the\ncompany of my colleagues was a tonic. As awaiting-trial prisoners we were entitled to two half-hour visits a week, and one meal a day could be\nsent in from the outside. I soon gained back my lost weight with Mrs. Pillay\u2019s delicious dinners.\nWhile we were preparing our defense, the government was trying the case in the newspapers. Normally, a case that is sub judice cannot be\ncommented upon in public or in the press. But since the men arrested at Rivonia were Ninety-Day detainees, and therefore not technically charged\nwith a crime, this judicial principle went by the wayside. We were publicly branded as violent revolutionaries by everyone from the minister of justice\non down. Newspapers regularly featured headlines like \u201cREVOLUTION ON MILITARY BASIS.\u201d\nOn October , we again entered the Palace of Justice; again the crowds were large and excited; again the security was extremely tight; again\nthe court was filled with dignitaries from many foreign embassies. After three weeks with my comrades I felt rejuvenated, and I was far more\n\n\fcomfortable in court this time in a suit. Our attorneys had objected to our having to come to court in prison garb and we had won the right to wear\nour own clothes. We again raised clenched fists to the gallery, and were warned that if we did it again, we would be forced to come to court in our\nprison khakis. To prevent such outbursts, the authorities reversed the normal order of the prisoners preceding the judge into the courtroom. After\nthat first day, the judge entered first so that court would already be in session when we entered.\nWe went on the attack immediately \u2014 Bram Fischer criticized the state\u2019s indictment as shoddy, poorly drawn, and containing absurdities such as\nthe allegation that I had participated in certain acts of sabotage on dates when I was in Pretoria Local. Yutar was flummoxed. Judge de Wet looked\nto him to reply to Bram\u2019s argument, and instead of offering particulars he began to give what the judge derided as \u201ca political speech.\u201d De Wet was\nimpatient with Yutar\u2019s fumbling and told him so. \u201cThe whole basis of your argument as I understand it, Mr. Yutar, is that you are satisfied that the\naccused are guilty.\u201d De Wet then quashed the indictment and gaveled the session to a close.\nFor that moment we were technically free, and there was pandemonium in the court. But we were rearrested even before Judge de Wet left his\nseat. Lieutenant Swanepoel clapped each of us on the shoulder and said, \u201cI am arresting you on a charge of sabotage,\u201d and we were herded back\nto our cells. Even so, this was a blow to the government, for they now had to go back to the drawing board in the case they were calling the trial to\nend all trials.\n\nThe state redrew their indictment and we were back in court in early December. We all sensed that in the interim Justice de Wet had grown more\nhostile to us. We suspected his previous independence had brought down the wrath of the government and pressure had been applied. The new\ncharges were read: we were alleged to have recruited persons for sabotage and guerrilla warfare for the purpose of starting a violent revolution; we\nhad allegedly conspired to aid foreign military units to invade the republic in order to support a Communist revolution; and we had solicited and\nreceived funds from foreign countries for this purpose. The orders for munitions on the part of the accused, said Yutar melodramatically, were\nenough to blow up Johannesburg.\nThe registrar then requested our pleas. We had agreed not to plead in the traditional manner but to use the moment to show our disdain for the\nproceedings.\n\u201cAccused number one, Nelson Mandela, do you plead guilty or not guilty?\u201d\nI rose and said, \u201cMy Lord, it is not I, but the government that should be in the dock. I plead not guilty.\u201d\n\u201cAccused number two, Walter Sisulu, do you plead guilty or not guilty?\u201d\nSisulu: \u201cThe government is responsible for what has happened in this country. I plead not guilty.\u201d\nJustice de Wet said he was not interested in hearing political speeches, that we should merely plead not guilty or guilty. But his direction was\nignored. Each of the accused suggested that it was the government that was criminal before pleading not guilty.\nTo enhance the drama of the proceedings, the state had made arrangements for a live broadcast of Yutar\u2019s speech on the South African\nBroadcasting System. Microphones had been placed on the prosecution table as well as in front of the judge. But just as Yutar was clearing his\nthroat, Bram Fischer rose and made an application to the court for the removal of the microphones on the grounds that the broadcasts would\nunfairly prejudice the case and were not in keeping with the dignity of the court. Despite Yutar\u2019s shrill plea for their retention, Justice de Wet ordered\nthem removed.\nIn his address, Yutar argued that from the time the ANC had been driven underground, the organization had embarked on a policy of violence\ndesigned to lead from sabotage through guerrilla warfare to an armed invasion of the country. He asserted that we planned to deploy thousands of\ntrained guerrilla units throughout the country, and these units were to spearhead an uprising that would be followed by an armed invasion by military\nunits of a foreign power. \u201cIn the midst of the resulting chaos, turmoil, and disorder,\u201d Yutar proclaimed, \u201cit was planned by the accused to set up a\nProvisional Revolutionary Government to take over the administration and control of the country.\u201d The engine of this grand plan was Umkhonto we\nSizwe, under the political direction of the ANC and the Communist Party, and the headquarters of Umkhonto was Rivonia.\nIn his orotund prose, Yutar described how we recruited members for MK, how we planned our national uprising for  (here he was confusing\nus with the PAC), how we erected a powerful radio transmitter at Rivonia, and how we were collectively responsible for two hundred twenty-two acts\nof sabotage. He said Elias Motsoaledi and Andrew Mlangeni were in charge of recruiting members and that Dennis Goldberg ran a special school\nfor recruits in the Cape. He detailed the production of various bombs, as well as the solicitation of money abroad.\nOver the next three months, the state produced one hundred seventy-three witnesses and entered into the record thousands of documents and\nphotographs, including standard works on Marxism, histories of guerrilla warfare, maps, blueprints, and a passport made out to one David\nMotsamayi. The first witness was a police photographer who had taken pictures of Rivonia, and the next witnesses were domestic workers for the\nGoldreich family, who had been held in detention all this time even though they had no connection to the politics of the household. These servants\nidentified most of us by pointing to us in the dock, but old Mr. Jelliman, in a brave attempt to help me, pretended that he did not see me when he\nwas asked to point to accused number one. Look again, the prosecutor said, go over all the faces carefully. \u201cI do not think he is here,\u201d Jelliman said\nquietly.\nWe wondered what evidence the state had to prove my guilt. I had been out of the country and in prison while much of the planning at Rivonia had\ntaken place. When I saw Walter in Pretoria Local just after my sentencing, I urged him to make sure that all my books and notes were removed from\nthe farm. But during the first week of the trial, when Rusty Bernstein applied for bail, Percy Yutar dramatically produced the sketch of the Fort and\nthe accompanying note about escape that I had made while detained there. Yutar exclaimed that this was evidence that all of the accused meant to\nescape. It was a sign that nothing of mine had been removed from Rivonia. Later, I was told that my colleagues at Rivonia had decided to preserve\nmy escape note because they thought it would be historic in the future. But in the present, it cost Rusty Bernstein his bail.\nThe state\u2019s star witness was Bruno Mtolo, or \u201cMr. X\u201d as he was known in court. In introducing \u201cMr. X,\u201d Yutar informed the court that the\ninterrogation would take three days and then, in theatrical tones, he added that the witness was \u201cin mortal danger.\u201d Yutar asked that the evidence be\ngiven in camera, but that the press be included provided that they not identify the witness.\nMtolo was a tall, well-built man with an excellent memory. A Zulu from Durban, he had become the leader of the Natal region of MK. He was an\nexperienced saboteur, and had been to Rivonia. I had met him only once, when I addressed his group of MK cadres in Natal after my return from\nthe continent. His evidence concerning me in particular made me realize that the state would certainly be able to convict me.\nHe began by saying that he was an MK saboteur who had blown up a municipal office, a power pylon, and an electricity line. With impressive\nprecision, he explained the operation of bombs, land mines, and grenades, and how MK worked from underground. Mtolo said that while he had\nnever lost faith in the ideals of the ANC, he did lose faith in the organization when he realized that it and MK were instruments of the Communist\nParty.\nHis testimony was given with simplicity and what seemed like candor, but Mtolo had gone out of his way to embellish his evidence. This was\nundoubtedly done on police instructions. He told the court that during my remarks to the Natal Regional Command I had stated that all MK cadres\n\n\fought to be good Communists but not to disclose their views publicly. In fact, I never said anything of the sort, but his testimony was meant to link\nme and MK to the Communist Party. His memory appeared so precise the ordinary person would assume that it was accurate in all instances. But\nthis was not so.\nI was bewildered by Mtolo\u2019s betrayal. I never ruled out the possibility of even senior ANC men breaking down under police torture. But by all\naccounts, Mtolo was never touched. On the stand, he went out of his way to implicate people who were not even mentioned in the case. It is\npossible, I know, to have a change of heart, but to betray so many others, many of whom were quite innocent, seemed to me inexcusable.\nDuring cross-examination we learned that Mtolo had been a petty criminal before joining MK and had been imprisoned three previous times for\ntheft. But despite these revelations, he was an extremely damaging witness, for the judge found him reliable and believable, and his testimony\nincriminated nearly all of us.\nThe keystone of the state\u2019s case was the six-page Plan of Action confiscated in the Rivonia raid. The leaders of the High Command had had this\nvery document before them on the table when the police stormed the farm. Operation Mayibuye sketches out in general form the plan for the\npossible commencement of guerrilla operations, and how it might spark a mass armed uprising against the government. It envisions an initial\nlanding of small guerrilla forces in four different areas of South Africa and the attacking of preselected targets. The document set a goal of seven\nthousand MK recruits in the country who would meet the initial outside force of one hundred twenty trained guerrillas.\nThe prosecution\u2019s case rested in large part on their contention that Operation Mayibuye had been approved by the ANC executive and had\nbecome the operating plan of MK. We insisted that Operation Mayibuye had not yet been formally adopted and was still under discussion at the\ntime of the arrests. As far as I was concerned, Operation Mayibuye was a draft document that was not only not approved, but was entirely\nunrealistic in its goals and plans. I did not believe that guerrilla warfare was a viable option at that stage.\nThe plan had been drafted in my absence so I had very little knowledge of it. Even among the Rivonia Trialists there was disagreement as to\nwhether the plan had been adopted as ANC policy. Govan, who had drafted the document with Joe Slovo, insisted that it had been agreed upon\nand felt that it was wrong for us to argue in court that it was still under discussion. But all the other accused contended that the document, while\ndrawn up by the High Command, had not been approved by the ANC executive or even seen by Chief Luthuli.\n\nAlthough a capital trial can be quite grim, our spirits were generally high. There was a good deal of gallows humor among us. Dennis Goldberg, the\nyoungest of the accused, had an irrepressible sense of humor and often had us laughing when we should not have been. When one of the\nprosecution witnesses described how Raymond Mhlaba had worn a clerical collar as a disguise, Dennis took to calling him Reverend Mhlaba.\nIn our consulting room downstairs, we often communicated through notes, which we would then burn and throw in the wastebasket. One of the\nSpecial Branch officers who looked after us was Lieutenant Swanepoel, a burly, red-faced fellow who was convinced we were always putting one\nover on him. One day, while Swanepoel was observing us from the door, Govan Mbeki began to write a note in a conspicuously secretive manner.\nWith similar drama he handed me the note. I read it, nodded my head sagely, and passed it to Kathy, who ostentatiously took out his matches as if\nto burn the note when Swanepoel swooped into the room, grabbed the paper out of Kathy\u2019s hands, and said something about the dangers of\nlighting matches indoors. He then left the room to read his prize; a few seconds later, he stormed back saying, \u201cI will get all of you for this!\u201d Govan\nhad written in capital letters: \u201cISN\u2019T SWANEPOEL A FINE-LOOKING CHAP?\u201d\nWe were locked up in prison and on trial for our lives, but outside new life was blossoming. Jimmy Kantor\u2019s wife was to give birth any day. Jimmy\nwas an attorney who had been roped into the trial by the state for no other reason than that he was Harold Wolpe\u2019s brother-in-law.\nOne morning, when we were sitting in the dock, a note was passed down to me from the other end.\nBarbara and I have discussed godfathers at length and we have come to the conclusion that, whether the baby is a girl or boy, we would consider it an honour if you would agree to\naccept this office as an adjunct to the more disreputable positions you have held in the past.\n\nBy return mail I sent Jimmy back a note.\nI would be more than delighted, and the honour is mine, not the baby\u2019s. Now they dare not hang me. ONE MORNING, several days after my meeting with Bram and Joel, we were taken to the head office. The head office was only about a quarter of\na mile away and was a simple stone structure that resembled our own section. Once there, we were lined up to have our fingerprints taken, which\nwas routine prison service business. But while waiting, I noticed a warder with a camera. After our fingerprints had been taken, the chief warder\nordered us to line up for photographs. I motioned to my colleagues not to move, and I addressed the warder: \u201cI would like you to produce the\ndocument from the commissioner of prisons authorizing our pictures to be taken.\u201d Photographs of prisoners required such authorization.\nIt was always valuable to be familiar with regulations, because the warders themselves were often ignorant of them and could be intimidated by\none\u2019s superior knowledge. The warder was taken aback by my request and was unable to offer any explanation or produce anything in writing from\nthe commissioner of prisons. He threatened to charge us if we did not consent to have our photographs taken, but I said that if there was no\nauthorization, there would be no pictures, and that is where the matter remained.\nAs a rule, we objected to having our pictures taken in prison on the grounds that it is generally demeaning to be seen as a prisoner. But there\nwas one photograph I did consent to, the only one I ever agreed to while on Robben Island.\n\nOne morning, a few weeks later, the chief warder, instead of handing us hammers for our work in the courtyard, gave us each needles and thread\nand a pile of worn prison jerseys. We were instructed to repair the garments, but we discovered that most of these jerseys were frayed beyond\nrepair. This struck us as a curious task, and we wondered what had provoked the change. Later that morning, at about eleven o\u2019clock, the front gate\nswung open, revealing the commanding officer with two men in suits. The commanding officer announced that the two visitors were a reporter and\nphotographer from the Daily Telegraph in London. He related this as if visiting members of the international press were a regular diversion for us.\nAlthough these men were our first official visitors, we regarded them skeptically. Firstly, they were brought in under the auspices of the\ngovernment, and second, we were aware that the Telegraph was a conservative newspaper unlikely to be sympathetic to our cause. We well knew\nthat there was great concern in the outside world about our situation and that it was in the government\u2019s interest to show that we were not being\nmistreated.\nThe two journalists walked slowly around the courtyard, surveying us. We kept our heads down concentrating on our work. After they had made\none circuit, one of the guards plucked me by the shoulder and said, \u201cMandela, come, you will talk now.\u201d In those early days, I often spoke on behalf\nof my fellow prisoners. The prison service regulations were explicit that each prisoner was permitted to speak only for himself. This was done to\nnegate the power of organization and to neutralize our collective strength. We objected to this role, but made little headway. We were not even\npermitted to use the word we when we made complaints. But during the first few years, when the authorities needed one prisoner to speak on\nbehalf of others, that individual would be me.\nI talked to the reporter, whose name was Mr. Newman, for about twenty minutes, and was candid about both prison and the Rivonia Trial. He was\nan agreeable fellow, and at the end of our talk, he said he would like the photographer to take my picture. I was reluctant, but in this case relented\nbecause I knew the photograph would only be published overseas, and might serve to help our cause if the article was even the least bit friendly. I\ntold him I would agree provided Mr. Sisulu could join me. The image shows the two of us talking in the courtyard about some matter that I can no\nlonger remember. I never saw the article or heard anything about it. The reporters were barely out of sight when the warders removed the jerseys\nand gave us back our hammers.\n\nThe men from the Telegraph were the first of a small stream of visitors during those early months. While the Rivonia Trial still resonated in people\u2019s\nminds, the government was eager to show the international community that we were being treated properly. There were stories in the press about\nthe inhuman conditions on the island, about how we were being assaulted and tortured. These allegations embarrassed the government, and to\ncombat them they brought in a string of outsiders meant to rebut these critical stories.\nWe were briefly visited by a British lawyer who had argued for Namibian independence before the World Court, after which we were informed\nthat a Mr. Hynning, a representative of the American Bar Association, would be coming to see us. Americans were then a novelty in South Africa,\nand I was curious to meet a representative of so august a legal organization.\nOn the day of Mr. Hynning\u2019s visit we were called into the courtyard. The American arrived in the company of General Steyn, the commissioner of\nprisons, who rarely made appearances on the island. General Steyn was that unusual thing in the prison service, a polished and sophisticated man.\nHis suits were always of a fine quality and a fashionable cut. He was courtly, and referred to us as \u201cgentlemen,\u201d even doffing his hat to us,\nsomething no one else in the prison service ever did. Yet General Steyn oppressed us by omission rather than commission. He basically turned a\nblind eye to what was happening on the island. His habitual absence emboldened the more brutal prison officials and gave them carte blanche to\ndo whatever they wanted. In his most gracious manner, the general introduced our guest and said, \u201cGentlemen, please select your spokesman.\u201d A\nnumber of the prisoners called out my name.\nGeneral Steyn nodded in my direction, and I stood up. In contrast to General Steyn, Mr. Hynning was a heavyset, unkempt man. I thanked him for\nvisiting us and said we were honored by his presence. I then summarized our complaints, beginning with the central and most important one, that\nwe were political prisoners, not criminals, and that we should be treated as such. I enumerated our grievances about the food, our living conditions,\nand the work detail. But as I was speaking, Mr. Hynning kept interrupting me. When I made a point about the long hours doing mindless work, he\ndeclared that as prisoners we had to work and were probably lazy to boot.\nWhen I started to detail the problems with our cells, he interjected that the conditions in backward American prisons were far worse than Robben\nIsland, which was a paradise by comparison. He added that we had been justly convicted and were lucky not to have received the death penalty,\nwhich we probably deserved.\nMr. Hynning perspired a great deal and there were those among us who thought he was not altogether sober. He spoke in what I assumed was a\nsouthern American accent, and had a curious habit of spitting when he talked, something none of us had ever seen before.\nFinally, I had heard enough, and I interrupted him, \u201cNo, sir, you misunderstand the points that I am making.\u201d Hynning took offense that I was now\ncontradicting him, while General Steyn watched and listened without comment. Under the circumstances, it was difficult to keep tempers down. The\nmen were angered by Mr. Hynning\u2019s remarks and annoyed that he had been permitted to see us at all. Normally, a visit of any kind lifted our spirits\nbut the visit of Mr. Hynning was demoralizing. Perhaps that is what the authorities wanted. To meet someone with so impressive an affiliation and\nso little understanding was depressing. Hynning finally just turned and walked away without so much as a good-bye. We were not sorry to see him\n\n\fgo.\nWe discussed Mr. Hynning for years afterward and many of the men imitated the way he spoke to comic effect. We never heard about him again,\nand he certainly did not win any friends on Robben Island for the American Bar Association.\n IN JAIL, all prisoners are classified by the authorities as one of four categories: A, B, C, or D. A is the highest classification and confers the most\nprivileges; D is the lowest and confers the least. All political prisoners, or what the authorities called \u201csecurity prisoners,\u201d were automatically\nclassified as D on admission. The privileges affected by these classifications included visits and letters, studies, and the opportunity to buy\ngroceries and incidentals \u2014 all of which are the lifeblood of any prisoner. It normally took years for a political prisoner to raise his status from D to\nC.\nWe disdained the classification system. It was corrupt and demeaning, another way of repressing prisoners in general and political prisoners in\nparticular. We demanded that all political prisoners be in one category. Although we criticized it, we could not ignore it: the classification system\nwas an inflexible feature of prison life. If you protested that, as a D Group prisoner, you could receive only one letter every six months, the authorities\nwould say, Improve your behavior, become a C Group prisoner, and you will be able to receive two letters every six months. If you complained that\nyou did not receive enough food, the authorities would remind you that if you were in A Group, you would be able to receive money orders from the\noutside and purchase extra food at the prison canteen. Even a freedom fighter benefits from the ability to buy groceries and books.\nThe classifications generally ran parallel to the length of one\u2019s sentence. If you were sentenced to eight years, you would generally be classified\nas D for the first two years, C for the next two, B for the following two, and A for the last two. But the prison authorities wielded the classification\nsystem as a weapon against political prisoners, threatening to lower our hard-won classifications in order to control our behavior.\nThough I had been in prison for nearly two years before I was taken to Robben Island, I was still in D Group when I arrived. While I desired the\nprivileges that came with higher classifications, I refused to compromise my conduct. The fastest way to raise one\u2019s classification was to be docile\nand not complain. \u201cAg, Mandela, you are a troublemaker,\u201d the warders would say. \u201cYou will be in D Group for the rest of your life.\u201d\nEvery six months, prisoners were called before the prison board to have their classifications evaluated. The board was meant to assess our\nbehavior in terms of prison regulations, but we found that it preferred to act as a political tribunal rather than a mere evaluator of behavior. During\nmy first meeting with the board, the officials asked me questions about the ANC and my beliefs. Although this had nothing to do with the\nclassification system, I was vain enough to answer and think that I might convert them to my beliefs. It was one of the few times we were treated as\nhuman beings, and I for one responded. Later I realized that this was simply a technique on the part of the authorities to glean information from us,\nand I had fallen for it. Shortly afterward, we agreed among ourselves not to discuss politics with the prison board.\n\nAs a D Group prisoner, I was entitled to have only one visitor, and to write and receive only one letter, every six months. I found this one of the most\ninhumane restrictions of the prison system. Communication with one\u2019s family is a human right; it should not be restricted by the artificial gradations\nof a prison system. But it was one of the facts of prison life.\nVisits and letters were restricted to \u201cfirst degree\u201d relatives. This was a restriction we not only found irksome but racist. The African sense of\nimmediate family is far different from that of the European or Westerner. Our family structures are larger and more inclusive; anyone who claims\ndescent from a common ancestor is deemed part of the same family.\nIn prison, the only thing worse than bad news about one\u2019s family is no news at all. It is always harder to cope with the disasters and tragedies one\nimagines than with the reality, however grim or disagreeable. A letter with ill tidings was always preferable to no letter at all.\nBut even this miserable restriction was abused by the authorities. The anticipation of mail was overwhelming. Mail call took place once a month,\nand sometimes six months would go by without a letter. To be allowed one letter in six months and then not to receive it is a great blow. One\nwonders: What has happened to my wife and children, to my mother and my sisters? When I did not receive a letter I felt as dry and barren as the\nGreat Karroo desert. Often the authorities would withhold mail out of spite. I can remember warders saying, \u201cMandela, we have received a letter for\nyou, but we cannot give it to you.\u201d No explanation of why, or whom the letter was from. It required all my self-discipline not to explode at such times.\nAfterward, I would protest through the proper channels, and sometimes get it.\nWhen letters did arrive, they were cherished. A letter was like the summer rain that could make even the desert bloom. When I was handed a\nletter by the authorities, I would not rush forward and grab it as I felt like doing, but take it in a leisurely manner. Though I yearned to tear it open and\nread it on the spot, I would not give the authorities the satisfaction of seeing my eagerness, and I would return slowly to my cell as though I had many\nthings to occupy me before opening a letter from my family.\nDuring the first few months, I received one letter from Winnie, but it was so heavily censored that not much more than the salutation was left. The\nisland\u2019s censors would black out the offending passages in ink, but they later changed this when they realized we could wash away the ink and see\nwhat was underneath. They began to use razors to slice out whole paragraphs. Since most letters were written on both sides of a single piece of\npaper, the material on the other side would also be excised. They seemed to relish delivering letters in tatters. The censorship delayed the delivery\nof mail because warders, some of whom were not proficient in English, might take as long as a month to censor a letter. The letters we wrote were\ncensored as well; they were often as cut up as the letters we received.\n\nAt the end of August, after I had been on the island less than three months, I was informed by the authorities that I would have a visitor the following\nday. They would not tell me who it was. Walter was informed that he, too, would have a visitor, and I suspected, I hoped, I wished \u2014 I believed \u2014\nthat it would be a visit from Winnie and Albertina.\nFrom the moment Winnie learned we had been brought to the island, she had been trying to arrange a visit. As a banned person, Winnie had to\nreceive a special dispensation from the minister of justice, for she was technically not permitted to communicate with me.\nEven with the help of the authorities, visiting Robben Island was not an easy proposition. Visits were a maximum of thirty minutes long, and\npolitical prisoners were not permitted contact visits, in which the visitor and prisoner were in the same room.\nVisits did not seem to be planned in advance by the authorities. One day, they would contact your wife and say, \u201cYou have permission to visit your\nhusband tomorrow.\u201d This was enormously inconvenient, and often had the effect of making visits impossible. If a family member was able to plan a\nvisit in advance, the authorities would sometimes deliberately delay issuing a permit until after the plane had departed. Since most of the men\u2019s\nfamilies lived far from the Cape and had very little money, visits by family members were often far beyond their means. Some men who came from\npoor families did not see their wives for many years at a time, if at all. I knew of men who spent a decade or more on Robben Island without a single\nvisit.\n\n\fThe visiting room for noncontact visits was cramped and windowless. On the prisoner\u2019s side, there was a row of five cubicles with small square\npieces of glass that looked out on identical cubicles on the other side. One sat in a chair and looked through the thick, smudged glass that had a\nfew small holes drilled into it to permit conversation. One had to talk very loudly to be heard. Later the authorities installed microphones and\nspeakers in front of the glass, a marginal improvement.\nWalter and I were called to the visitors\u2019 office in the late morning and took seats at the far end of the room. I waited with some anxiety, and\nsuddenly, filling out the glass on the other side of the window was Winnie\u2019s lovely face. Winnie always dressed up for prison visits, and tried to wear\nsomething new and elegant. It was tremendously frustrating not to be able to touch my wife, to speak tenderly to her, to have a private moment\ntogether. We had to conduct our relationship at a distance under the eyes of people we despised.\nI could see immediately that Winnie was under tremendous strain. Seeing me in such circumstances must have been trying. Just getting to the\nisland itself was difficult, and added to that were the harsh rituals of the prison, the undoubted indignities of the warders, and the impersonality of\nthe contact.\nWinnie, I later discovered, had recently received a second banning order and had been terminated from her job at the Child Welfare Office as a\nresult. Her office was searched by the police shortly before she was fired. The authorities were convinced that Winnie was in secret communication\nwith me. Winnie loved her job as a social worker. It was the hands-on end of the struggle: placing babies with adoptive parents, finding work for the\nunemployed and medical help for the uninsured. The banning and harassment of my wife greatly troubled me: I could not look after her and the\nchildren, and the state was making it difficult for her to look after herself. My powerlessness gnawed at me.\nOur conversation was awkward at first, and was not made easier by the presence of two warders standing directly behind her and three behind\nme. Their role was not only to monitor but to intimidate. Regulations dictated that conversation had to be in either English or Afrikaans \u2014 African\nlanguages were forbidden \u2014 and could involve family matters only. Any line of talk that departed from the family and verged on the political might\nmean the abrupt termination of the visit. If one mentioned a name unfamiliar to the warders, they would interrupt the conversation, and ask who the\nperson was and the nature of the relationship. This happened often, as the warders were generally unfamiliar with the variety and nature of African\nnames. It was frustrating to spend precious minutes of one\u2019s visit explaining to a warder the different branches of one\u2019s family tree. But their\nignorance also worked in our favor: it allowed us to invent code names for people we wanted to talk about and pretend that we were referring to\nfamily members.\nThat first visit was important, for I knew that Winnie was anxious about my health: she had heard stories that we were being physically abused. I\nquickly informed her that I was fine and she could see that I was fit, though a bit thinner than before. She, too, was thinner, something I always\nattributed to stress. After a visit in which Winnie\u2019s face looked drawn or tense, I would urge her to put on a bit of weight. She was always dieting,\nand I was always telling her not to. I inquired one by one about all the children, about my mother and sisters, and Winnie\u2019s own family.\nSuddenly, I heard the warder behind me say, \u201cTime up! Time up!\u201d I turned and looked at him with incredulity. It was impossible that half an hour\nhad passed. But, in fact, he was right; visits always seemed to go by in the blink of an eye. For all the years that I was in prison, I never failed to be\nsurprised when the warder called, \u201cTime up!\u201d Winnie and I were both hustled from our chairs and we waved a quick farewell. I always felt like\nlingering after Winnie left, just to retain the sense of her presence, but I would not let the warders see such emotion. As I walked back to the cell, I\nreviewed in my head what we had talked about. Over the next days, weeks, and months, I would return to that one visit again and again. I knew I\nwould not be able to see my wife again for at least six months. As it turned out, Winnie was not able to visit me for another two years.\n ONE MORNING in early January, as we lined up to be counted before beginning work in the courtyard, we were instead marched outside and\nordered into a covered truck. It was the first time that we had left our compound. No announcement was made as to our destination, but I had an\nidea of where we were headed. A few minutes later we emerged from the truck in a place that I had first seen when I was on the island in : the\nlime quarry.\nThe lime quarry looked like an enormous white crater cut into a rocky hillside. The cliffs and the base of the hillside were blindingly white. At the\ntop of the quarry were grass and palm trees, and at the base was a clearing with a few old metal sheds.\nWe were met by the commanding officer, Colonel Wessels, a rather colorless fellow who cared only about strict adherence to prison regulations.\nWe stood at attention as he told us that the work we would be doing would last six months and afterward we would be given light tasks for the\nduration of our terms. His timing was considerably off. We remained at the quarry for the next thirteen years.\nAfter the C.O.\u2019s speech, we were handed picks and shovels and given rudimentary instructions as to the mining of lime. Mining lime is not a\nsimple task. That first day, we were clumsy with our new tools and extracted little. The lime itself, which is the soft, calcified residue of seashells and\ncoral, is buried in layers of rock, and one had to break through to it with a pick, and then extract the seam of lime with a shovel. This was far more\nstrenuous than the work in the courtyard, and after our first few days on the quarry we fell asleep immediately after our supper at : in the\nafternoon. We woke the next morning aching and still tired.\nThe authorities never explained why we had been taken from the courtyard to the quarry. They may simply have needed extra lime for the island\u2019s\nroads. But when we later discussed the transfer, we assumed it was another way of enforcing discipline, of showing us that we were not different\nfrom the general prisoners \u2014 who worked in the island\u2019s stone quarry \u2014 and that we had to pay for our crimes just as they did. It was an attempt to\ncrush our spirits.\nBut those first few weeks at the quarry had the opposite effect on us. Despite blistered and bleeding hands, we were invigorated. I much\npreferred being outside in nature, being able to see grass and trees, to observe birds flitting overhead, to feel the wind blowing in from the sea. It\nfelt good to use all of one\u2019s muscles, with the sun at one\u2019s back, and there was simple gratification in building up mounds of stone and lime.\nWithin a few days, we were walking to the quarry, rather than going by truck, and this too was a tonic. During our twenty-minute march to the\nquarry, we got a better sense of the island, and could see the dense brush and tall trees that covered our home, and smell the eucalyptus blossoms,\nspot the occasional springbok or kudu grazing in the distance. Although some of the men regarded the march as drudgery, I never did.\n\nAlthough our work at the quarry was meant to show us that we were no different from the other prisoners, the authorities still treated us like the\nlepers who once populated the island. Sometimes we would see a group of common-law prisoners working by the side of the road, and their\nwarders would order them into the bushes so they would not see us as we marched past. It was as if the mere sight of us might somehow affect\ntheir discipline. Sometimes out of the corner of an eye we could see a prisoner raise his fist in the ANC salute.\nNear the quarry, the dirt road diverged, and to the right the general prisoners trooped off to the rock quarry. This crossroads was later to become\nan important site of communications with them. Where the road branched, we could see in the brush the small white cottage where Robert\nSobukwe lived. The house had been built for a black warder years before, and now Sobukwe lived in it by himself. It was a tiny plot, unkempt and\novergrown, and one would not even know that anyone lived there, except for the guard who stood in front.\nSobukwe\u2019s sentence had ended in , but under what became known as the Sobukwe clause of the General Law Amendment Act of ,\nthe minister of justice could hold political prisoners indefinitely without charge. That is precisely what they did with Bob. For six years, Sobukwe\nlived a kind of half-life on the island; he was a free man who was denied his liberty. Sometimes we were able to get a glimpse of him in his garden,\nbut that was all.\n\nAfter arriving in the morning, we would fetch our picks, shovels, hammers, and wheelbarrows from a zinc shed at the top of the quarry. Then we\nwould array ourselves along the quarry face, usually in groups of three or four. Warders with automatic weapons stood on raised platforms watching\nus. Unarmed warders walked among us, urging us to work harder. \u201cGaan aan! Gaan aan!\u201d (Go on! Go on!), they would shout, as if we were oxen.\nBy eleven, when the sun was high in the sky, we would begin to flag. By that time, I would already be drenched in sweat. The warders would then\ndrive us even harder. \u201cNee, man! Kom aan! Kom aan!\u201d (No, man! Come on! Come on!), they would shout. Just before noon, when we would break\nfor lunch, we would pile the lime into wheelbarrows and cart it over to the truck, which would take it away.\nAt midday, a whistle would blow, and we would make our way to the bottom of the hill. We sat on makeshift seats under a simple zinc shed\nshielding us from the sun. The warders ate at a larger shed with tables and benches. Drums of boiled mealies were delivered to us. Hundreds of\nseagulls, screaming and swooping, circled above us as we ate, and a well-aimed dropping could sometimes spoil a man\u2019s lunch.\nWe worked until four, when we again carted the lime to the waiting truck. By the end of the day, our faces and bodies were caked with white dust.\nWe looked like pale ghosts except where rivulets of sweat had washed away the lime. When we returned to our cells, we would scrub ourselves in\nthe cold water, which never seemed to completely rinse away the dust.\n\nWorse than the heat at the quarry was the light. Our backs were protected from the sun by our shirts, but the sun\u2019s rays would be reflected into our\neyes by the lime itself. The glare hurt our eyes and, along with the dust, made it difficult to see. Our eyes teared and our faces became fixed in a\npermanent squint. It would take a long time after each day\u2019s work for our eyes to adjust to the diminished light.\nAfter our first few days at the quarry, we made an official request for sunglasses. The authorities refused. This was not unexpected, for we were\nthen not even permitted reading glasses. I had previously pointed out to the commanding officer that it did not make sense to permit us to read\nbooks but not permit us glasses to read them with.\nDuring the following weeks and months, we requested sunglasses again and again. But it was to take us almost three years before we were\nallowed to have them, and that was only after a sympathetic physician agreed that the glasses were necessary to preserve our eyesight. Even then,\nwe had to purchase the glasses ourselves.\nFor us, such struggles \u2014 for sunglasses, long trousers, study privileges, equalized food \u2014 were corollaries to the struggle we waged outside\nprison. The campaign to improve conditions in prison was part of the apartheid struggle. It was, in that sense, all the same; we fought injustice\n\n\fwherever we found it, no matter how large, or how small, and we fought injustice to preserve our own humanity.\n\nShortly after we started working at the quarry, we were joined in Section B by a number of other prominent political prisoners. Several were MK\nmen who had been arrested in July of  and convicted of more than fifty acts of sabotage in what became known as the \u201clittle Rivonia Trial.\u201d\nThese included Mac Maharaj, a member of the SACP and one of the sharpest minds in the struggle; Laloo Chiba, also a member of the MK High\nCommand, and a stalwart colleague who proved a great asset in prison; and Wilton Mkwayi, the Treason Trialist who had been mistakenly let go\nduring a moment of confusion when the State of Emergency was declared in . He had left South Africa secretly, received military training, and\nbecome commander-in-chief of MK after the Rivonia Trial. We were also joined by Eddie Daniels, a Coloured member of the Liberal Party, who\nhad been convicted for sabotage operations undertaken by the African Resistance Movement, a small sabotage group composed of members of\nthe Liberal Party. Eddie was to become one of my greatest friends in prison.\nTo counterbalance the effect of these new political allies, the authorities also put a handful of common-law prisoners in our section. These men\nwere hardened criminals, convicted of murder, rape, and armed robbery. They were members of the island\u2019s notorious criminal gangs, either the\nBig Fives or the Twenty-Eights, which terrorized other prisoners. They were brawny and surly, and their faces bore the scars of the knife fights that\nwere common among gang members. Their role was to act as agents provocateurs, and they would attempt to push us around, take our food, and\ninhibit any political discussions we tried to have. One of these fellows was known as Bogart, after the American tough-guy movie actor. He had a\ncell opposite Walter\u2019s and Walter used to complain that he would demand Walter\u2019s breakfast from him each morning, and that he was too scared to\nrefuse.\nThe gang members worked in their own clique apart from us at the quarry. One day, they began singing what sounded like a work song. In fact, it\nwas a famous work song with their own adapted lyrics: \u201cBenifunani eRivonia?,\u201d which means \u201cWhat did you want at Rivonia?\u201d The next line was\nsomething like \u201cDid you think that you would become the government?\u201d They sang exuberantly and with a mocking tone. They had obviously been\nencouraged by the warders, who were hoping that the song would provoke us.\nAlthough the more hotheaded among us wanted to confront them, instead, we decided to fight fire with fire. We had far more and better singers\namong us than they had, and we huddled together and planned our response. Within a few minutes, we were all singing the song \u201cStimela,\u201d a\nrousing anthem about a train making its way down from Southern Rhodesia. \u201cStimela\u201d is not a political song, but in the context, it became one, for\nthe implication was that the train contained guerrillas coming down to fight the South African army.\nFor a number of weeks our two groups sang as we worked, adding songs and changing lyrics. Our repertoire increased, and we were soon\nsinging overt political songs, such as \u201cAmajoni,\u201d a song about guerrilla soldiers, the title of which was a corruption of the English slang word for\nsoldier, Johnny; and \u201cTshotsholoza,\u201d a song that compares the struggle to the motion of an oncoming train. (If you say the title over and over, it\nmimics the sound of the train.) We sang a song about the Freedom Charter, and another about the Transkei, whose lyrics said, \u201cThere are two\nroads, one road is the Matanzima road, and one road is the Mandela road, which one will you take?\u201d\nThe singing made the work lighter. A few of the fellows had extraordinary voices, and I often felt like putting my pick down and simply listening.\nThe gang members were no competition for us; they soon became quiet while we continued singing. But one of the warders was fluent in Xhosa\nand understood the content of our songs, and we were soon ordered to stop singing. (Whistling was also banned.) From that day on we worked in\nsilence.\n\nI saw the gang members not as rivals but as raw material to be converted. There was a nonpolitical prisoner among us, nicknamed Joe My Baby,\nwho later joined the ANC and proved invaluable in helping us smuggle material in and out of prison.\nOne day we heard that Bogart had been savagely beaten by a warder at the quarry. I did not see the assault, but I saw the results. His face cut\nand badly bruised, Bogart approached me in our corridor and asked for help. I immediately agreed to take up his case.\nWe were always looking for ways to stand up to the authorities, and the report of a beating was the kind of incident we could raise with the head\noffice. Shortly before this, we had learned that a certain PAC man named Ganya had been beaten by a warder. In my role as an attorney, I wrote a\nletter to the commissioner of prisons protesting on behalf of Ganya. I was brought to the Head Office, where I was confronted by prison officials. In\nthe same breath they denied that the beating had occurred and wanted to know how I had heard about it. I insisted that the warder who had beaten\nGanya be removed from the island. They refused, saying there was no evidence against him. But shortly afterward the warder in question was\ntransferred off the island.\nI had been emboldened by this case, so when Bogart asked for help I immediately demanded to see the commanding officer. The next day I was\nsummoned to the head office, where the commander blandly informed me that the case had been investigated and dismissed. \u201cThat\u2019s a violation of\nregulations,\u201d I said. \u201cThe case must be tried.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have attempted to interview the so-called complainant and he denies that he was ever assaulted.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d I said. \u201cI spoke to him only yesterday.\u201d The commander gestured to a lieutenant and said, \u201cThen see for yourself.\u201d The\nlieutenant led Bogart into the room. His face was covered with bandages. The commander asked him whether or not he had been beaten. \u201cNo,\nbaas,\u201d he said quietly, without meeting my gaze, \u201cI was never assaulted.\u201d He was then dismissed.\n\u201cWell, Mandela,\u201d the commander said. \u201cThe case is closed.\u201d The commander had succeeded in humiliating me. He had obviously bribed Bogart\nwith extra food and tobacco to drop his charges. From that point on, I demanded a signed and written statement from a prisoner before I agreed to\ntake up his case. IN THE MEANTIME, court resumed, in our absence, on March , but the witness box was conspicuously empty. Those who did attend were the\naccused whom the police had failed to pick up under the State of Emergency. Chief Luthuli had been in the middle of his evidence, and Judge\nRumpff asked for an explanation for his absence. He was informed that the chief had been taken into custody the night before. Judge Rumpff\nexpressed irritation with the explanation and said he did not see why the State of Emergency should stand in the way of his trial. He demanded that\nthe police bring the chief to court so that he could resume his testimony, and court was adjourned.\nLater we discovered that after the chief\u2019s arrest, he had been assaulted. He had been walking up some stairs when he was jostled by a warder,\ncausing his hat to fall to the floor. As he bent to pick it up, he was smacked across the head and face. This was hard for us to take. A man of\nimmense dignity and achievement, a lifelong devout Christian, and a man with a dangerous heart condition, was treated like a barnyard animal by\nmen who were not fit to tie his shoes.\nWhen we were called back into session that morning, Judge Rumpff was informed that the police refused to bring the chief to court. The judge\nthen adjourned court for the day, and we expected to go home. But as they were leaving the court grounds to find transportation, we were all once\nagain rearrested.\nBut the police, with their usual disorganized overzealousness, made a comical mistake. Wilton Mkwayi, one of the accused and a longtime union\nleader and ANC man, had traveled to Pretoria for the trial from Port Elizabeth. Somehow he had gotten separated from his colleagues and when he\napproached the gate and saw the commotion of his fellow accused being arrested, he asked a policeman what was going on. The policeman\nordered him to leave. Wilton stood there. The policeman again ordered him to leave, whereupon Wilton informed the officer he was one of the\naccused. The officer called him a liar, and threatened to arrest him for obstruction of justice. The officer then angrily ordered him to leave the area.\nWilton shrugged his shoulders, walked out of the gate, and that was the last anyone saw of Wilton in court. He went underground for the next two\nmonths, successfully evading arrest, and then was smuggled out of the country, soon emerging as a foreign representative for the Congress of\nTrade Unions and later going for military training in China.\nThat night, we were joined by detainees from other parts of the Transvaal. The countrywide police raid had led to the detention without trial of\nmore than two thousand people. These men and women belonged to all races and all anti-apartheid parties. A call-up of soldiers had been\nannounced, and units of the army had been mobilized and stationed in strategic areas around the country. On April , both the ANC and the PAC\nwere declared illegal organizations, under the Suppression of Communism Act. Overnight, being a member of the ANC had become a felony\npunishable by a term in jail and a fine. The penalty for furthering the aims of the ANC was imprisonment for up to ten years. Now even nonviolent\nlaw-abiding protests under the auspices of the ANC were illegal. The struggle had entered a new phase. We were now, all of us, outlaws.\nFor the duration of the State of Emergency we stayed at Pretoria Local, where the conditions were as bad as those at Newlands. Groups of five\nprisoners were pressed into cells measuring nine feet by seven feet; the cells were filthy, with poor lighting and worse ventilation. We had a single\nsanitary pail with a loose lid and vermin-infested blankets. We were allowed outside for an hour a day.\nOn our second day in Pretoria, we sent a deputation to complain about the conditions to the prison\u2019s commanding officer, Colonel Snyman. The\ncolonel\u2019s response was rude and abrupt. He demanded that we produce evidence, calling our complaints lies. \u201cYou have brought the vermin into my\nprison from your filthy homes,\u201d he sneered.\nI said we also required a room that was quiet and well lit so that we could prepare for our case. The colonel was again contemptuous:\n\u201cGovernment regulations do not require prisoners to read books, if you can read at all.\u201d Despite the colonel\u2019s disdainful attitude, the cells were soon\npainted and fumigated and we were supplied with fresh blankets and sanitary pails. We were permitted to stay out in the yard for much of the day,\nwhile those of us involved in the Treason Trial were provided with a large cell for consultations, in which we were also permitted to keep legal\nbooks.\nPretoria Local would be our home for the foreseeable future. We would leave for the trial in the morning and return to the prison in the afternoon.\nThe prison, according to apartheid dictates, separated detainees by color. We were of course already separated from our white colleagues, but the\nseparation from our Indian and Coloured comrades within the same non-White facility seemed like madness. We demanded to be accommodated\ntogether, and were given all sorts of absurd explanations why this was impossible. When the proverbial inflexibility of red tape is combined with the\npetty small-mindedness of racism, the result can be mind-boggling. But the authorities eventually yielded, allowing the Treason Trialists to be kept\ntogether.\nAlthough we were kept together, our diet was fixed according to race. For breakfast, Africans, Indians, and Coloureds received the same\nquantities, except that Indians and Coloureds received a half-teaspoonful of sugar, which we did not. For supper, the diets were the same, except\nthat Indians and Coloureds received four ounces of bread while we received none. This latter distinction was made on the curious premise that\nAfricans did not naturally like bread, which was a more sophisticated or \u201cWestern\u201d taste. The diet for white detainees was far superior to that for\nAfricans. So color-conscious were the authorities that even the type of sugar and bread supplied to whites and nonwhites differed: white prisoners\nreceived white sugar and white bread, while Coloured and Indian prisoners were given brown sugar and brown bread.\nWe complained vociferously about the inferior quality of the food, and as a result, our advocate Sydney Kentridge made a formal complaint in\ncourt. I stated that the food was unfit for human consumption. Judge Rumpff agreed to sample the food himself and that day went out to do so.\nSamp and beans was the best meal that the prison prepared, and in this case, the authorities put in more beans and gravy than usual. Judge\nRumpff ate a few spoonfuls and pronounced the food well cooked and tasty. He did allow that it should be served warm. We laughed among\nourselves at the idea of \u201cwarm\u201d jail food; it was a contradiction in terms. Eventually, the authorities supplied the detainees with what they called an\nImproved Diet: Africans received bread, while Indians and Coloureds received the same food provided to white prisoners.\n\nI enjoyed one extraordinary privilege during our detention: weekend trips to Johannesburg. These were not a vacation from prison but a busman\u2019s\nholiday. Shortly before the State of Emergency, Oliver left South Africa on the instructions of the ANC. We had long suspected a clamp-down was\ncoming, and the Congress decided that certain members needed to leave the country to strengthen the organization abroad in anticipation of the\ntime it would be banned entirely.\nOliver\u2019s departure was one of the most well-planned and fortunate actions ever taken by the movement. At the time we hardly suspected how\nabsolutely vital the external wing would become. With his wisdom and calmness, his patience and organizational skills, his ability to lead and\ninspire without stepping on toes, Oliver was the perfect choice for this assignment.\nBefore leaving, Oliver had retained a mutual friend of ours, Hymie Davidoff, a local attorney, to close up our office and wind up our practice.\nDavidoff made a special request to Colonel Prinsloo to permit me to come to Johannesburg on weekends to help him put things in order. In a fit of\n\n\fgenerosity, Colonel Prinsloo agreed, allowing me to be driven to Johannesburg on Friday afternoons to work in the office all weekend and then be\ndriven back to the trial on Monday morning. Sergeant Kruger and I would leave after court adjourned at one o\u2019clock on Friday, and after arriving at\nmy office, I would work with Davidoff and our accountant Nathan Marcus. I would spend the nights in Marshall Square prison and the days at the\noffice.\nSergeant Kruger was a tall and imposing fellow who treated us with fairness. On the way from Pretoria to Johannesburg, he would often stop the\ncar and leave me inside while he went into a shop to buy biltong, oranges, and chocolate for both of us. I thought about jumping out of the car,\nespecially on Fridays, when the sidewalks and streets were busy and one could get lost in a crowd.\nWhile at the office, I could walk downstairs to the ground-floor caf\u00e9 to buy incidentals, and he turned his head aside on one or two occasions\nwhen Winnie came to visit me. We had a kind of gentleman\u2019s code between us: I would not escape and thereby get him into trouble, while he\npermitted me a degree of freedom. ON APRIL , the day before the trial was to resume, Issy Maisels called us together to discuss the grave effect the State of Emergency was\nhaving on the conduct of the trial. Because of the Emergency Regulations, consultations between the accused and our lawyers had become virtually\nimpossible. Our lawyers, who were based in Johannesburg, had trouble seeing us in prison and were unable to prepare our case. They would often\ndrive up and be informed that we were not available. Even when we were able to see them, consultations were harassed and cut short. More\nimportant, Maisels explained that under the Emergency Regulations, those already in detention would be exposing themselves to further detention\nmerely by testifying, for they would inevitably make statements regarded as \u201csubversive,\u201d thereby subjecting themselves to greater penalties.\nDefense witnesses who were not imprisoned now risked detainment if they testified.\nThe defense team proposed that they withdraw from the case in protest. Maisels explained the serious implications of such a withdrawal and the\nconsequences of our conducting our own defense in a capital case. Under the hostile atmosphere at the time, he said, the judges might see fit to\ngive us longer terms of imprisonment. We discussed the proposal among ourselves, and each of the twenty-nine accused \u2014 we were now minus\nWilton Mkwayi \u2014 was able to express his opinion. The resolution was unanimously endorsed, and it was agreed that Duma Nokwe and I would\nhelp in preparing the case in the absence of our lawyers. I was in favor of this dramatic gesture, for it highlighted the iniquities of the State of\nEmergency.\nOn April , Duma Nokwe, the first African advocate in the Transvaal, rose in court and made the sensational announcement that the accused\nwere instructing defense counsel to withdraw from the case. Maisels then said simply, \u201cWe have no further mandate and we will consequently not\ntrouble Your Lordships any further,\u201d after which the defense team silently filed out of the synagogue. This shocked the three-judge panel, who\nwarned us in direst terms about the dangers of conducting our own defense. But we were angry and eager to take on the state. For the next five\nmonths, until the virtual end of the Emergency, we conducted our own defense.\nOur strategy was simple and defensive in nature: to drag out the case until the State of Emergency was lifted and our lawyers could return. The\ncase had gone on so long already that it did not seem to matter if we stretched it out even further. In practice, this strategy became rather comical.\nUnder the law, each one of us was now entitled to conduct his own defense and was able to call as a witness each of the other accused; and each\nof the accused was entitled to cross-examine each witness. We were arranged in alphabetical order according to the docket and accused number\none was Farid Adams, of the Transvaal Indian Youth Congress. Farid would open his case by calling accused number two, Helen Joseph, as his\nfirst witness. After being examined by Farid, Helen would then be cross-examined by the twenty-seven other co-accused. She would then be crossexamined by the Crown and reexamined by accused number one. Adams would then proceed to call accused number three, and so on, and the\nwhole procedure would duplicate itself until every accused was called in this fashion. At that rate, we would be at trial until the millennium.\n\nIt is never easy to prepare a case from prison, and in this instance we were hampered by the customary apartheid barriers. All of the accused\nneeded to be able to meet together but prison regulations prohibited meetings between male and female prisoners, and between black and white,\nso we were not permitted to consult with Helen Joseph, Leon Levy, Lilian Ngoyi, and Bertha Mashaba.\nHelen, as the first witness to be called, needed to prepare her evidence in the presence of Duma, myself, and Farid Adams, who would be\nexamining her. After protracted negotiations with the prison authorities, we were permitted to have consultations under very strict conditions. Helen\nJoseph, Lilian, Leon, and Bertha were to be brought from their various prisons and sections (separated by race and gender) to the African men\u2019s\nprison. The first stipulation was that there could be no physical contact between white and black prisoners, and between male and female\nprisoners. The authorities erected an iron grille to separate Helen and Leon (as whites) from us and a second partition to separate them from\nLilian, who was also participating in the preparations. Even a master architect would have had trouble designing such a structure. In prison we were\nseparated from each other by this elaborate metal contraption, while in court we all mingled freely.\nWe first needed to coach Farid in the art of courtroom etiquette, and rehearse Helen\u2019s testimony. To help Helen, I was playing the role that Farid\nwould play in court. I assumed the proper courtroom manner and began the examination.\n\u201cName?\u201d I said.\n\u201cHelen Joseph,\u201d she replied.\n\u201cAge?\u201d\nSilence. I repeated, \u201cAge?\u201d\nHelen pursed her lips and waited. Then, after some moments, she scowled at me and said sharply, \u201cWhat has my age to do with this case,\nNelson?\u201d\nHelen was as charming as she was courageous, but she also had an imperious side. She was a woman of a certain age, and sensitive about it. I\nexplained that it was customary to note down the witness\u2019s particulars, such as name, age, address, and place of birth. A witness\u2019s age helps the\ncourt to weigh her testimony and influences sentencing.\nI continued: \u201cAge?\u201d\nHelen stiffened. \u201cNelson,\u201d she said, \u201cI will cross that bridge when I come to it in court, but not until then. Let us move on.\u201d\nI then asked her a series of questions that she might expect from the Crown in a manner perhaps too realistic for her, because at one point Helen\nturned to me and said, \u201cAre you Mandela or are you the prosecutor?\u201d\nThere were other light moments, some of which were quite encouraging.\nI was permitted to visit Helen Joseph on weekends and bring her records of the proceedings. On these occasions I met other women detainees\nand consulted with them as possible witnesses. I was always very cordial with the white wardresses, and I noticed that my visits caused\nconsiderable interest. The wardresses had never known there was even such a species as an African lawyer or doctor, and regarded me as an\nexotic creature. But as I became more familiar they became more friendly and at ease, and I joked with them that I would handle any of their legal\nproblems. Seeing prominent and educated white women discussing serious matters with a black man on the basis of perfect equality could only\nlead to the weakening of the wardresses\u2019 apartheid assumptions.\nOnce during a long interview with Helen, I turned to the wardress who was required to sit in on our conversation and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bore you\nwith this endless consultation.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cyou are not boring me at all, I am enjoying it.\u201d I could see she was following our conversation, and\nonce or twice she even offered small suggestions. I saw this as one of the side benefits of the trial. Most of these wardresses had no idea why we\nwere in prison, and gradually began to discover what we were fighting for and why we were willing to risk jail in the first place.\nThis is precisely why the National Party was violently opposed to all forms of integration. Only a white electorate indoctrinated with the idea of the\nblack threat, ignorant of African ideas and policies, could support the monstrous racist philosophy of the National Party. Familiarity, in this case,\n\n\fwould not breed contempt, but understanding, and even, eventually, harmony.\nThe light moments in prison could not make up for the low ones. Winnie was allowed to visit on a number of occasions while I was in Pretoria,\nand each time she brought Zenani, who was then beginning to walk and talk. I would hold her and kiss her if the guards permitted me, and toward\nthe end of the interview, hand her back to Winnie. As Winnie was saying good-bye, and the guards were ushering them out, Zeni would often\nmotion for me to come with them, and I could see on her small puzzled face that she did not understand why I could not.\n\nIn court, Farid Adams deftly led Helen through her evidence-in-chief. He argued frequently and fairly competently with the judges. We were now\nenergized: no longer was anyone doing crossword puzzles to pass the time. As the accused took turns cross-examining the witnesses, the Crown\nand the prosecution began to get a sense for the first time of the true caliber of the men and women on trial.\nAccording to South African law, since we were in the Supreme Court, Duma, as an advocate, was the only one permitted to address the judges\ndirectly. I, as an attorney, could instruct him, but I was not technically permitted to address the court, and neither were any of the other defendants.\nWe dismissed our advocates under the correct assumption that an accused, in the absence of representation, would be permitted to address the\ncourt. I addressed the court and Justice Rumpff, trying to frustrate us, interrupted me. \u201cYou appreciate the fact, Mr. Mandela,\u201d he said, \u201cthat Mr.\nNokwe, as an advocate, is the only lawyer who is permitted to address the court.\u201d To which I replied, \u201cVery well, My Lord, I believe we are all\nprepared to abide by that as long as you are prepared to pay Mr. Nokwe his fees.\u201d From then on no one objected to any of the accused addressing\nthe court.\nWhile Farid was questioning Helen and the subsequent witnesses, Duma and I sat on either side of him, supplying him with questions, helping\nhim to deal with legal issues as they arose. In general, he did not need much prompting. But one day, when we were under constant pressure, we\nwere whispering suggestions to him every few seconds. Farid seemed weary, and Duma and I were running out of material. Then, without\nconsulting us, Farid suddenly asked the judges for a postponement, saying he was fatigued. The judges refused his application, saying it was not\nsufficient reason for a postponement and reiterating the warning they gave us the day our lawyers withdrew.\nThat afternoon there was no singing as we returned to prison, and everyone sat with sullen faces. A crisis was brewing among the accused.\nUpon our arrival in prison, a handful of the accused demanded a meeting. I called all the men together, and J. Nkampeni, a businessman from Port\nElizabeth who had helped out the families of defiers during the Defiance Campaign, led what turned out to be an attack.\n\u201cMadiba,\u201d he said, using my clan name as a sign of respect, \u201cI want you to tell us why you drove away our lawyers.\u201d I reminded him that the\nlawyers were not released by any one individual; their withdrawal had been approved by all, including himself. \u201cBut what did we know about court\nprocedure, Madiba?\u201d he said. \u201cWe relied on you lawyers.\u201d\nA substantial number of men shared Nkampeni\u2019s misgivings. I warned them against the dangers of being disheartened and insisted we were\ndoing quite well. I said that today was a minor setback, and that we would face worse difficulties. Our case was far more than a trial of legal issues\nbetween the Crown and a group of people charged with breaking the law. It was a trial of strength, a test of the power of a moral idea versus an\nimmoral one, and I said we needed to worry about more than just the legal technique of our advocates. The protest abated.\nAfter Helen Joseph had been cross-examined and reexamined, accused number three, Ahmed Kathrada, opened his case. It was during the\ntestimony of Kathy\u2019s second witness, accused number four, Stanley Lollan, a member of the executive of the Coloured People\u2019s Congress, that\nPrime Minister Verwoerd announced that the State of Emergency would soon be lifted. The Emergency had never been intended to be permanent,\nand the government believed that it had successfully stifled the liberation struggle. At this point, our defense lawyers returned, to the general relief of\nall of us, though we remained in prison for another few weeks. We had been kept in detention and had functioned without our lawyers for more than\nfive months.\n\nMy own testimony began on August . I felt well prepared through my preparation of the others. After three years of silence, banning, and internal\nexile, I looked forward to the chance to speak out before the people attempting to judge me. During my evidence-in-chief I preached moderation\nand reaffirmed the ANC\u2019s commitment to nonviolent struggle. In answer to a question as to whether democracy could be achieved through gradual\nreforms, I suggested it could.\nWe demand universal adult franchise and we are prepared to exert economic pressure to attain our demands. We will launch defiance campaigns, stay-at-homes, either singly or\ntogether, until the Government should say, \u201cGentlemen, we cannot have this state of affairs, laws being defied, and this whole situation created by stay-at-homes. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d In my\nown view I would say, \u201cYes, let us talk\u201d and the Government would say, \u201cWe think that the Europeans at present are not ready for a type of government where they might be\ndominated by non-Europeans. We think we should give you  seats. The African population to elect  Africans to represent them in Parliament. We will leave the matter over for\nfive years and we will review it at the end of five years.\u201d In my view, that would be a victory, My Lords; we would have taken a significant step toward the attainment of universal adult\nsuffrage for Africans, and we would then for the five years say, We will suspend civil disobedience.\n\nThe state was determined to prove that I was a dangerous, violence-spouting Communist. While I was not a Communist or a member of the\nparty, I did not want to be seen as distancing myself from my Communist allies. Although I could have been sent back to jail for voicing such views, I\ndid not hesitate to reaffirm the tremendous support the Communists had given us. At one point, the bench posed the question as to whether or not I\nthought a one-party state was a viable option for South Africa.\nNM: My Lord, it is not a question of form, it is a question of democracy. If democracy would be best expressed by a one-party system then I would examine the proposition very\ncarefully. But if a democracy could best be expressed by a multiparty system then I would examine that carefully. In this country, for example, we have a multiparty system at\npresent, but so far as the non-Europeans are concerned this is the most vicious despotism that you could think of.\n\nI became testy with Judge Rumpff when he fell into the same mistake made by so many white South Africans about the idea of a universal\nfranchise. Their notion was that to exercise this responsibility, voters must be \u201ceducated.\u201d To a narrow-thinking person, it is hard to explain that to\nbe \u201ceducated\u201d does not only mean being literate and having a B.A., and that an illiterate man can be a far more \u201ceducated\u201d voter than someone with\nan advanced degree.\nJUSTICE RUMPFF: What is the value of participation in the Government of a state of people who know nothing?\nNM: My Lord, what happens when illiterate whites vote . . .\nJUSTICE RUMPFF: Are they not subject as much to the influence of election leaders as children would be?\nNM: No, My Lord, this is what happens in practice. A man stands up to contest a seat in a particular area; he draws up a manifesto, and he says, \u201cThese are the ideas for which I\nstand\u201d; it is a rural area and he says, \u201cI am against stock limitation\u201d; then, listening to the policy of this person, you decide whether this man will advance your interests if you\nreturn him to Parliament, and on that basis you vote for a candidate. It has nothing to do with education.\n\n\fJUSTICE RUMPFF: He only looks to his own interests?\nNM: No, a man looks at a man who will be able to best present his point of view and votes for that man.\n\nI told the court that we believed we could achieve our demands without violence, through our numerical superiority.\nWe had in mind that in the foreseeable future it will be possible for us to achieve these demands, and we worked on the basis that Europeans themselves in spite of the wall of\nprejudice and hostility which we encountered, that they can never remain indifferent indefinitely to our demands, because we are hitting them in the stomach with our policy of\neconomic pressure. The Europeans dare not look at it with indifference. They would have to respond to it and indeed, My Lord, they are responding to it.\n\nThe Emergency was lifted on the last day of August. We would be going home for the first time in five months. When people in Johannesburg\nheard about the end of the Emergency, they drove up on the chance that we might be released; when we were let go, we were met with a jubilant\nreception from friends and family. Winnie had gotten a ride to Pretoria and our reunion was joyous. I had not held my wife in five months or seen her\nsmile with joy. For the first time in five months, I slept in my own bed that night.\nAfter one has been in prison, it is the small things that one appreciates: being able to take a walk whenever one wants, going into a shop and\nbuying a newspaper, speaking or choosing to remain silent. The simple act of being able to control one\u2019s person.\n\nEven after the end of the Emergency, the trial continued for another nine months until March , . In many ways, these were the glory days for\nthe accused, for our own people were on the stand fearlessly enunciating ANC policy. Robert Resha forcefully disputed the government\u2019s absurd\ncontention that the ANC wanted to induce the government to use violence so we could use violence in return. Gert Sibande eloquently told the court\nof the miseries of African farmworkers. Venerable Isaac Behndy of Ladysmith, eighty-one years old, a lay preacher of the African Native Mission\nChurch, explained why we opted for stay-at-homes instead of strikes.\nIn October, the redoubtable Professor Matthews was called as our final witness. He was imperturbable on the witness stand and treated the\nprosecutors as though they were errant students who needed stern admonishment. Often he would reply to the overmastered prosecutor with some\nversion of the following: \u201cWhat you really want me to say is that the speech which you allege is violent represents the policy of my organization. First,\nyour contention is incorrect and second, I am not going to say that.\u201d\nHe explained in beautiful language that the African people knew that a nonviolent struggle would entail suffering but had chosen it because they\nprized freedom above all else. People, he said, will willingly undergo the severest suffering in order to free themselves from oppression. With\nProfessor Matthews in the dock, the defense ended on a high note. After he finished testifying, Justice Kennedy shook his hand and expressed the\nhope that they would meet again under better circumstances. EVEN BEFORE the doors of the Old Synagogue opened on the morning of March , , the day of the long-anticipated verdict in the Treason\nTrial, a crowd of supporters and press people jostled to get inside. Hundreds were turned away. When the judges brought the court to order, the\nvisitors\u2019 gallery and the press bench were packed. Moments after Justice Rumpff pounded his gavel, the Crown made an extraordinary application\nto change the indictment. This was the fifty-ninth minute of the eleventh hour, and it was two years too late. The court rebuffed the prosecution and\nthe gallery murmured its approval.\n\u201cSilence in the court!\u201d the orderly yelled, and Judge Rumpff announced that the three-judge panel had reached a verdict. Silence now reigned. In\nhis deep, even voice, Judge Rumpff reviewed the court\u2019s conclusions. Yes, the African National Congress had been working to replace the\ngovernment with a \u201cradically and fundamentally different form of state\u201d; yes, the African National Congress had used illegal means of protest during\nthe Defiance Campaign; yes, certain ANC leaders had made speeches advocating violence; and yes, there was a strong left-wing tendency in the\nANC that was revealed in its anti-imperialist, anti-West, pro-Soviet attitudes, but \u2014\nOn all the evidence presented to this court and on our finding of fact it is impossible for this court to come to the conclusion that the African National Congress had acquired or\nadopted a policy to overthrow the state by violence, that is, in the sense that the masses had to be prepared or conditioned to commit direct acts of violence against the state.\n\nThe court said the prosecution had failed to prove that the ANC was a Communist organization or that the Freedom Charter envisioned a\nCommunist state. After speaking for forty minutes, Justice Rumpff said, \u201cThe accused are accordingly found not guilty and are discharged.\u201d\nThe spectators\u2019 gallery erupted in cheers. We stood and hugged each other, and waved to the happy courtroom. All of us then paraded into the\ncourtyard, smiling, laughing, crying. The crowd yelled and chanted as we emerged. A number of us hoisted our defense counsels on our shoulders,\nwhich was no easy task in the case of Issy Maisels, for he was such a large man. Flashbulbs were popping all around us. We looked around for\nfriends, wives, relatives. Winnie had come up and I hugged her in joy, though I knew that while I might be free for this moment, I would not be able to\nsavor that freedom. When we were all outside together, the Treason Trialists and the crowd all began to sing \u201cNkosi Sikelel\u2019 iAfrika.\u201d\nAfter more than four years in court and dozens of prosecutors, thousands of documents and tens of thousands of pages of testimony, the state\nhad failed in its mission. The verdict was an embarrassment to the government, both at home and abroad. Yet the result only embittered the state\nagainst us even further. The lesson they took away was not that we had legitimate grievances but that they needed to be far more ruthless.\n\nI did not regard the verdict as a vindication of the legal system or evidence that a black man could get a fair trial in a white man\u2019s court. It was the\nright verdict and a just one, but it was largely as a result of a superior defense team and the fair-mindedness of the panel of these particular judges.\nThe court system, however, was perhaps the only place in South Africa where an African could possibly receive a fair hearing and where the role\nof law might still apply. This was particularly true in courts presided over by enlightened judges who had been appointed by the United Party. Many\nof these men still stood by the rule of law.\nAs a student, I had been taught that South Africa was a place where the rule of law was paramount and applied to all persons, regardless of their\nsocial status or official position. I sincerely believed this and planned my life based on that assumption. But my career as a lawyer and activist\nremoved the scales from my eyes. I saw that there was a wide difference between what I had been taught in the lecture room and what I learned in\nthe courtroom. I went from having an idealistic view of the law as a sword of justice to a perception of the law as a tool used by the ruling class to\nshape society in a way favorable to itself. I never expected justice in court, however much I fought for it, and though I sometimes received it.\nIn the case of the Treason Trial, the three judges rose above their prejudices, their education, and their background. There is a streak of\ngoodness in men that can be buried or hidden and then emerge unexpectedly. Justice Rumpff, with his aloof manner, gave the impression\nthroughout the proceedings that he shared the point of view of the ruling white minority. Yet in the end, an essential fairness dominated his\njudgment. Kennedy was less conservative than his colleagues and seemed attracted by the idea of equality. Once, for example, he and Duma\nNokwe flew on the same plane from Durban to Johannesburg, and when the airline bus to town refused to take Duma, Kennedy refused to ride in it\nas well. Judge Bekker always struck me as open-minded and seemed aware that the accused before him had suffered a great deal at the hands of\nthe state. I commended these three men as individuals, not as representatives of the court or of the state or even of their race, but as exemplars of\nhuman decency under adversity.\nJudge Bekker\u2019s wife was a person sensitive to the needs of others. During the State of Emergency, she collected goods which she brought to\nthe accused.\nBut the consequence of the government\u2019s humiliating defeat was that the state decided never to let it happen again. From that day forth they were\nnot going to rely on judges whom they had not themselves appointed. They were not going to observe what they considered the legal niceties that\nprotected terrorists or permitted convicted prisoners certain rights in jail. During the Treason Trial, there were no examples of individuals being\nisolated, beaten, and tortured in order to elicit information. All of those things became commonplace shortly thereafter.\n , WHO HAD NEVER been a soldier, who had never fought in battle, who had never fired a gun at an enemy, had been given the task of starting an\narmy. It would be a daunting task for a veteran general much less a military novice. The name of this new organization was Umkhonto we Sizwe\n(The Spear of the Nation) \u2014 or MK for short. The symbol of the spear was chosen because with this simple weapon Africans had resisted the\nincursions of whites for centuries.\nAlthough the executive of the ANC did not allow white members, MK was not thus constrained. I immediately recruited Joe Slovo, and along with\nWalter Sisulu, we formed the High Command with myself as chairman. Through Joe, I enlisted the efforts of white Communist Party members who\nhad resolved on a course of violence and had already executed acts of sabotage like cutting government telephone and communication lines. We\nrecruited Jack Hodgson, who had fought in World War II and was a member of the Springbok Legion, and Rusty Bernstein, both party members.\nJack became our first demolitions expert. Our mandate was to wage acts of violence against the state \u2014 precisely what form those acts would take\nwas yet to be decided. Our intention was to begin with what was least violent to individuals but most damaging to the state.\nI began the only way I knew how, by reading and talking to experts. What I wanted to find out were the fundamental principles for starting a\nrevolution. I discovered that there was a great deal of writing on this very subject, and I made my way though the available literature on armed\nwarfare and in particular guerrilla warfare. I wanted to know what circumstances were appropriate for a guerrilla war; how one created, trained, and\nmaintained a guerrilla force; how it should be armed; where it gets its supplies \u2014 all basic and fundamental questions.\nAny and every source was of interest to me. I read the report of Blas Roca, the general secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, about their\nyears as an illegal organization during the Batista regime. In Commando, by Deneys Reitz, I read of the unconventional guerrilla tactics of the Boer\ngenerals during the Anglo-Boer War. I read works by and about Che Guevara, Mao Tse-tung, Fidel Castro. In Edgar Snow\u2019s brilliant Red Star Over\nChina I saw that it was Mao\u2019s determination and nontraditional thinking that led him to victory. I read The Revolt by Menachem Begin and was\nencouraged by the fact that the Israeli leader had led a guerrilla force in a country with neither mountains nor forests, a situation similar to our own. I\nwas eager to know more about the armed struggle of the people of Ethiopia against Mussolini, and of the guerrilla armies of Kenya, Algeria, and\nthe Cameroons.\nI went into the South African past. I studied our history both before and after the white man. I probed the wars of African against African, of African\nagainst white, of white against white. I made a survey of the country\u2019s chief industrial areas, the nation\u2019s transportation system, its communication\nnetwork. I accumulated detailed maps and systematically analyzed the terrain of different regions of the country.\n\nOn June , , our Freedom Day, I released a letter to South African newspapers from underground, which commended the people for their\ncourage during the recent stay-at-home, once more calling for a national constitutional convention. I again proclaimed that a countrywide campaign\nof noncooperation would be launched if the state failed to hold such a convention. My letter read in part:\nI am informed that a warrant for my arrest has been issued, and that the police are looking for me. The National Action Council has given full and serious consideration to this\nquestion . . . and they have advised me not to surrender myself. I have accepted this advice, and will not give myself up to a Government I do not recognize. Any serious politician will\nrealize that under present day conditions in the country, to seek for cheap martyrdom by handing myself to the police is naive and criminal. . . .\nI have chosen this course which is more difficult and which entails more risk and hardship than sitting in gaol. I have had to separate myself from my dear wife and children,\nfrom my mother and sisters to live as an outlaw in my own land. I have had to close my business, to abandon my profession, and live in poverty, as many of my people are doing. . .\n. I shall fight the Government side by side with you, inch by inch, and mile by mile, until victory is won. What are you going to do? Will you come along with us, or are you going to cooperate with the Government in its efforts to suppress the claims and aspirations of your own people? Are you going to remain silent and neutral in a matter of life and death to my\npeople, to our people? For my own part I have made my choice. I will not leave South Africa, not will I surrender. Only through hardship, sacrifice and militant action can freedom be\nwon. The struggle is my life. I will continue fighting for freedom until the end of my days. DURING THOSE FIRST few months underground I lived for a few weeks with a family on Market Street, after which I shared a one-room groundfloor bachelor flat with Wolfie Kodesh in Berea, a quiet white suburb a short distance north of downtown. Wolfie was a member of the Congress of\nDemocrats, a reporter for New Age, and had fought in North Africa and Italy during World War II. His knowledge of warfare and his firsthand battle\nexperience were extremely helpful to me. At his suggestion I read the Prussian general Karl von Clausewitz\u2019s classic work On War. Clausewitz\u2019s\ncentral thesis, that war was a continuation of diplomacy by other means, dovetailed with my own instincts. I relied on Wolfie to procure reading\nmaterial for me and I fear that I took over his life, infringing on both his work and pleasure. But he was such an amiable, modest fellow that he never\ncomplained.\n* * *\nI spent nearly two months in his flat, sleeping on a campaign stretcher, staying inside during the day with the blinds drawn reading and planning,\nleaving only for meetings or organizing sessions at night. I annoyed Wolfie every morning, for I would wake up at five, change into my sweat clothes,\nand run in place for more than an hour. Wolfie eventually surrendered to my regimen and began working out with me in the morning before he left for\ntown.\nMK was then practicing setting off explosions. One night, I accompanied Wolfie to an old brickworks on the outskirts of town for a demonstration.\nIt was a security risk, but I wanted to attend MK\u2019s first test of an explosive device. Explosions were common at the brickworks, for companies would\nuse dynamite to loosen the clay before the great machines scooped it up to make bricks. Jack Hodgson had brought along a paraffin tin filled with\nnitroglycerin; he had created a timing device that used the inside of a ball-point pen. It was dark and we had only a small light, and we stood to the\nside as Jack worked. When it was ready, we stood back and counted down to thirty seconds; there was a great roar and much displaced earth.\nThe explosion had been a success, and we all quickly returned to our cars and went off in different directions.\n\nI felt safe in Berea. I did not go outside, and because it was a white area, the police would probably not think to look for me there. While I was\nreading in the flat during the day, I would often place a pint of milk on the windowsill to allow it to ferment. I am very fond of this sour milk, which is\nknown as amasi among the Xhosa people and is greatly prized as a healthy and nourishing food. It is very simple to make and merely involves\nletting the milk stand in the open air and curdle. It then becomes thick and sour, rather like yogurt. I even prevailed upon Wolfie to try it, but he\ngrimaced when he tasted it.\nOne evening, after Wolfie had returned, we were chatting in the flat when I overheard a conversation going on near the window. I could hear two\nyoung black men speaking in Zulu, but I could not see them, as the curtains were drawn. I motioned Wolfie to be quiet.\n\u201cWhat is \u2018our milk\u2019 doing on that window ledge?\u201d one of the fellows said.\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d replied the other fellow.\n\u201cThe sour milk \u2014 amasi \u2014 on the window ledge,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is it doing there?\u201d Then there was silence. The sharp-eyed fellow was\nsuggesting that only a black man would place milk on the ledge like that and what was a black man doing living in a white area? I realized then that I\nneeded to move on. I left for a different hideout the next night.\n\nI stayed at a doctor\u2019s house in Johannesburg, sleeping in the servants\u2019 quarters at night, and working in the doctor\u2019s study during the day. Whenever\nanyone came to the house during the day, I would dash out to the backyard and pretend to be the gardener. I then spent about a fortnight on a sugar\nplantation in Natal living with a group of African laborers and their families in a small community called Tongaat, just up the coast from Durban. I\nlived in a hostel and posed as an agricultural demonstrator who had come at the behest of the government to evaluate the land.\nI had been equipped by the organization with a demonstrator\u2019s tools and I spent part of each day testing the soil and performing experiments. I\nlittle understood what I was doing and I do not think I fooled the people of Tongaat. But these men and women, who were mostly farmworkers, had a\nnatural kind of discretion and did not question my identity, even when they began seeing people arriving at night in cars, some of them well-known\nlocal politicians. Often I was at meetings all night and would sleep all day \u2014 not the normal schedule of an agricultural demonstrator. But even\nthough I was involved in other matters I felt a closeness with the community. I would attend services on Sunday, and I enjoyed the old-fashioned,\nBible-thumping style of these Zionist Christian ministers. Shortly before I was planning to leave, I thanked one elderly fellow for having looked after\nme. He said, \u201cYou are of course welcome, but, Kwedeni [young man], please tell us, what does Chief Luthuli want?\u201d I was taken aback but I quickly\nresponded. \u201cWell, it would be better to ask him yourself and I cannot speak for him, but as I understand it, he wants our land returned, he wants our\nkings to have their power back, and he wants us to be able to determine our own future and run our own lives as we see fit.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how is he going to do that if he does not have an army?\u201d the old man said.\nI wanted very much to tell the old man that I was busy attempting to form that army, but I could not. While I was encouraged by the old man\u2019s\nsentiments, I was nervous that others had discovered my mission as well. Again I had stayed too long in one place, and the following night I left as\nquietly as I had arrived.\n THE INITIAL HEARING was set for Monday, October , . The organization had set up a Free Mandela Committee and launched a lively\ncampaign with the slogan \u201cFree Mandela.\u201d Protests were held throughout the country and the slogan began to appear scrawled on the sides of\nbuildings. The government retaliated by banning all gatherings relating to my imprisonment, but this restriction was ignored by the liberation\nmovement.\nIn preparation for Monday\u2019s hearing, the Free Mandela Committee had organized a mass demonstration at the courthouse. The plan was to have\npeople line both sides of the road along the route my van would take. From press reports, conversations with visitors, and even the remarks of\nprison guards, I learned that a large and vociferous turnout was expected.\nOn Saturday, while I was preparing myself for the Monday hearing, I was ordered to pack my things immediately: the hearing had been shifted to\nPretoria. The authorities had made no announcement, and had I not managed to get word out through a sympathetic jailer, no one would have\nknown that I had left Johannesburg.\nBut the movement reacted quickly, and by the time my case began on Monday morning, the Old Synagogue was packed with supporters. The\nsynagogue was like a second home to me after four years of the Treason Trial. My legal adviser, Joe Slovo, could not be present as he was\nconfined to Johannesburg by bans and I was ably assisted instead by Bob Hepple.\n\nI entered the court that Monday morning wearing a traditional Xhosa leopard-skin kaross instead of a suit and tie. The crowd of supporters rose as\none and with raised, clenched fists shouted \u201cAmandla!\u201d and \u201cNgawethu!\u201d The kaross electrified the spectators, many of whom were friends and\nfamily, some of whom had come all the way from the Transkei. Winnie also wore a traditional beaded headdress and an ankle-length Xhosa skirt.\nI had chosen traditional dress to emphasize the symbolism that I was a black African walking into a white man\u2019s court. I was literally carrying on\nmy back the history, culture, and heritage of my people. That day, I felt myself to be the embodiment of African nationalism, the inheritor of Africa\u2019s\ndifficult but noble past and her uncertain future. The kaross was also a sign of contempt for the niceties of white justice. I well knew the authorities\nwould feel threatened by my kaross as so many whites feel threatened by the true culture of Africa.\nWhen the crowd had quieted down and the case was called, I formally greeted the prosecutor, Mr. Bosch, whom I had known from my attorney\ndays, and the magistrate, Mr. Van Heerden, who was also familiar to me. I then immediately applied for a two-week remand on the grounds that I\nhad been transferred to Pretoria without being given the opportunity of notifying my attorneys. I was granted a week\u2019s postponement.\nWhen I was on my way back to my cell, a very nervous white warder said that the commanding officer, Colonel Jacobs, had ordered me to hand\nover the kaross. I said, \u201cYou can tell him that he is not going to have it.\u201d This warder was a weak fellow, and he started trembling. He practically\nbegged me for it and said he would be fired if he did not bring it back. I felt sorry for him and I said, \u201cLook, here, just tell your commanding officer\nthat it is Mandela speaking, not you.\u201d A short while later Colonel Jacobs himself appeared and ordered me to turn over what he referred to as my\n\u201cblanket.\u201d I told him that he had no jurisdiction over the attire I chose to wear in court and if he tried to confiscate my kaross I would take the matter\nall the way to the Supreme Court. The colonel never again tried to take my \u201cblanket,\u201d but the authorities would permit me to wear it only in court, not\non my way to or from court for fear it would \u201cincite\u201d other prisoners.\n\nWhen the case resumed a week later I was given permission to address the court before I was asked to plead. \u201cI hope to be able to indicate,\u201d I\nexplained, \u201cthat this case is a trial of the aspirations of the African people, and because of that I thought it proper to conduct my own defense.\u201d I\nwanted to make it clear to the bench, the gallery, and the press that I intended to put the state on trial. I then made application for the recusal of the\nmagistrate on the grounds that I did not consider myself morally bound to obey laws made by a Parliament in which I had no representation. Nor\nwas it possible to receive a fair trial from a white judge:\nWhy is it that in this courtroom I am facing a white magistrate, confronted by a white prosecutor, escorted by white orderlies? Can anybody honestly and seriously suggest that in\nthis type of atmosphere the scales of justice are evenly balanced? Why is it that no African in the history of this country has ever had the honor of being tried by his own kith and kin,\nby his own flesh and blood? I will tell Your Worship why: the real purpose of this rigid color bar is to ensure that the justice dispensed by the courts should conform to the policy of\nthe country, however much that policy might be in conflict with the norms of justice accepted in judiciaries throughout the civilized world. . . . Your Worship, I hate racial\ndiscrimination most intensely and in all its manifestations. I have fought it all my life. I fight it now, and I will do so until the end of my days. I detest most intensely the set-up that\nsurrounds me here. It makes me feel that I am a black man in a white man\u2019s court. This should not be.\n\nDuring the trial the prosecutor called more than one hundred witnesses from all over the country, including the Transkei and South West Africa.\nThey were policemen, journalists, township superintendents, printers. Most of them gave technical evidence to show that I left the country illegally\nand that I had incited African workers to strike during the three-day stay-at-home in May . It was indisputable \u2014 and in fact I did not dispute \u2014\nthat I was technically guilty of both charges.\nThe prosecutor had called Mr. Barnard, the private secretary to the prime minister, to testify to the letter I had sent the prime minister demanding\nthat he call a national convention and informing him that if he did not, we would organize a three-day strike. In my cross-examination of Mr. Barnard I\nfirst read the court the letter I sent requesting that the prime minister call a national convention for all South Africans to write a new nonracial\nconstitution.\nNM: Did you place this letter before your prime minister?\nWITNESS: Yes.\nNM: Now was any reply given to this letter by the prime minister?\nWITNESS: He did not reply to the writer.\nNM: He did not reply to the letter. Now, will you agree that this letter raises matters of vital concern to the vast majority of the citizens of this country?\nWITNESS: I do not agree.\nNM: You don\u2019t agree? You don\u2019t agree that the question of human rights, of civil liberties, is a matter of vital importance to the African people?\nWITNESS: Yes, that is so, indeed.\nNM: Are these things mentioned here?\nWITNESS: Yes, I think so.\nNM: . . . You have already agreed that this letter raises questions like the rights of freedom, civil liberties, and so on?\nWITNESS: Yes, the letter raises it.\nNM: Now, you know of course that Africans don\u2019t enjoy the rights demanded in this letter? They are denied these rights of government.\nWITNESS: Some rights.\n\n\fNM: No African is a member of Parliament?\nWITNESS: That is right.\nNM: No African can be a member of the provincial council, of the municipal councils.\nWITNESS: Yes.\nNM: Africans have no vote in this country?\nWITNESS: They have got no vote as far as Parliament is concerned.\nNM: Yes, that is what I am talking about, I am talking about Parliament and other government bodies of the country, the provincial councils, the municipal councils. They have no\nvote?\nWITNESS: That is right.\nNM: Would you agree with me that in any civilized country in the world it would be scandalous for a prime minister to fail to reply to a letter raising vital issues affecting the majority of\nthe citizens of that country. Would you agree with that?\nWITNESS: I don\u2019t agree with that.\nNM: You don\u2019t agree that it would be irregular for a prime minister to ignore a letter raising vital issues affecting the vast majority of the citizens of that country?\nWITNESS: This letter has not been ignored by the prime minister.\nNM: Just answer the question. Do you regard it proper for a prime minister not to respond to pleas made in regard to vital issues by the vast majority of the citizens of the country?\nYou say that is wrong?\nWITNESS: The prime minister did respond to the letter.\nNM: Mr. Barnard, I don\u2019t want to be rude to you. Will you confine yourself to answering my questions. The question I am putting to you is, do you agree that it is most improper on the\npart of a prime minister not to reply to a communication raising vital issues affecting the vast majority of the country?\n\nMr. Barnard and I never did agree. In the end, he simply said that the tone of the letter was aggressive and discourteous and for that reason the\nprime minister did not answer it.\n* * *\nThroughout the proceedings the prosecutor and the magistrate repeatedly inquired about the number of witnesses I intended to call. I would always\nreply, \u201cI plan to call as many witnesses as the state, if not more.\u201d When the state finally concluded its case, there was a stillness in the courtroom in\nanticipation of the beginning of my defense. I rose and instead of calling my first witness, I declared quite matter-of-factly that I was not calling any\nwitnesses at all, at which point I abruptly closed my case. There was a murmur in the courtroom and the prosecutor could not help exclaiming,\n\u201cLord!\u201d\nI had misled the court from the beginning because I knew the charge was accurate and the state\u2019s case was solid, and I saw no point in\nattempting to call witnesses and defend myself. Through my cross-examination and attempts to force the judge to recuse himself, I had made the\nstatements I wanted about the unfairness of the court. I saw no advantage in calling witnesses to try to disprove something that was incontrovertible.\nThe magistrate was taken by surprise by my action and asked me with some incredulity, \u201cHave you anything more to say?\u201d\n\u201cYour Worship, I submit that I am guilty of no crime.\u201d\n\u201cIs that all you have to say?\u201d\n\u201cYour Worship, with respect, if I had something more to say I would have said it.\u201d\nThe prosecutor then shuffled through his papers attempting to get ready for an address he did not expect to have to make. He briefly addressed\nthe court and asked the magistrate to find me guilty on both counts. The court was then adjourned until the following day, when I would have a\nchance to address the court in what is known as the plea in mitigation before the magistrate gave his sentence.\n\nThe following morning, before court was called into session, I was in an office off the courtroom talking with Bob Hepple, who had been advising me\non the case, and we were praising the fact that the day before, the General Assembly of the U.N. had voted in favor of sanctions against South\nAfrica for the first time. Bob also told me that acts of sabotage in Port Elizabeth and Durban had occurred, both celebrating the U.N. vote and\nprotesting my trial. We were in the midst of this discussion when the prosecutor, Mr. Bosch, entered the room and then asked Bob to excuse\nhimself.\n\u201cMandela,\u201d he said, after Bob had left, \u201cI did not want to come to court today. For the first time in my career, I despise what I am doing. It hurts me\nthat I should be asking the court to send you to prison.\u201d He then reached out and shook my hand, and expressed the hope that everything would turn\nout well for me. I thanked him for his sentiments, and assured him that I would never forget what he had said.\nThe authorities were on alert that day. The crowd inside the courtroom seemed even larger than on the first day of the case. All one hundred fifty\n\u201cnon-European\u201d seats were filled. Winnie was present, in Xhosa dress, as well as a number of my relatives from the Transkei. Hundreds of\ndemonstrators stood a block from the courthouse, and there seemed to be as many policemen as spectators.\nWhen I walked in the courtroom, I raised my right fist and called out \u201cAmandla!\u201d which was met by a mighty \u201cNgawethu!\u201d The magistrate pounded\nhis gavel and cried for order. When the court was quiet, he summed up the charges, after which I had my opportunity to speak. My plea in mitigation\nlasted over an hour. It was not a judicial appeal at all but a political testament. I wanted to explain to the court how and why I had become the man I\nwas, why I had done what I had done, and why, if given the chance, I would do it again.\nMany years ago, when I was a boy brought up in my village in the Transkei, I listened to the elders of the tribe telling stories about the good old days before the arrival of the white\nman. Then our people lived peacefully, under the democratic rule of their kings and their amapakati [literally \u201cinsiders,\u201d but meaning those closest in rank to the king], and moved\nfreely and confidently up and down the country without let or hindrance. The country was our own, in name and right. We occupied the land, the forests, the rivers; we extracted the\nmineral wealth beneath the soil and all the riches of this beautiful country. We set up and operated our own government, we controlled our own arms and we organized our trade\nand commerce. The elders would tell tales of the wars fought by our ancestors in defense of the Fatherland, as well as the acts of valor by generals and soldiers during these epic\ndays. . . .\nThe structure and organization of early African societies in this country fascinated me very much and greatly influenced the evolution of my political outlook. The land, then the\nmain means of production, belonged to the whole tribe and there was no individual ownership whatsoever. There were no classes, no rich or poor and no exploitation of man by\nman. All men were free and equal and this was the foundation of government. Recognition of this general principle found expression in the constitution of the council, variously\ncalled \u201cImbizo\u201d or \u201cPitso\u201d or \u201cKgotla,\u201d which governs the affairs of the tribe. The council was so completely democratic that all members of the tribe could participate in its\ndeliberations. Chief and subject, warrior and medicine man, all took part and endeavored to influence its decisions. It was so weighty and influential a body that no step of any\nimportance could ever be taken by the tribe without reference to it.\nThere was much in such a society that was primitive and insecure and it certainly could never measure up to the demands of the present epoch. But in such a society are\ncontained the seeds of revolutionary democracy in which none will be held in slavery or servitude, and in which poverty, want and insecurity shall be no more. This is the history\nwhich, even today, inspires me and my colleagues in our political struggle.\n\nI told the court how I had joined the African National Congress and how its policy of democracy and nonracialism reflected my own deepest\nconvictions. I explained how as a lawyer I was often forced to choose between compliance with the law and accommodating my conscience.\n\n\fI would say that the whole life of any thinking African in this country drives him continuously to a conflict between his conscience on the one hand and the law on the other. This is\nnot a conflict peculiar to this country. The conflict arises for men of conscience, for men who think and who feel deeply in every country. Recently in Britain, a peer of the realm, Earl\n[Bertrand] Russell, probably the most respected philosopher of the Western world, was sentenced and convicted for precisely the type of activities for which I stand before you today\n\u2014 for following his conscience in defiance of the law, as a protest against the nuclear weapons policy being pursued by his own government. He could do no other than to oppose\nthe law and to suffer the consequences for it. Nor can I. Nor can many Africans in this country. The law as it is applied, the law as it has been developed over a long period of\nhistory, and especially the law as it is written and designed by the Nationalist government is a law which, in our views, is immoral, unjust, and intolerable. Our consciences dictate\nthat we must protest against it, that we must oppose it and that we must attempt to alter it. . . . Men, I think, are not capable of doing nothing, of saying nothing, of not reacting to\ninjustice, of not protesting against oppression, of not striving for the good society and the good life in the ways they see it.\n\nI recounted in detail the numerous times the government had used the law to hamper my life, career, and political work, through bannings,\nrestrictions, and trials.\nI was made, by the law, a criminal, not because of what I had done, but because of what I stood for, because of what I thought, because of my conscience. Can it be any wonder to\nanybody that such conditions make a man an outlaw of society? Can it be wondered that such a man, having been outlawed by the government, should be prepared to lead the life\nof an outlaw, as I have led for some months, according to the evidence before this court?\nIt has not been easy for me during the past period to separate myself from my wife and children, to say good-bye to the good old days when, at the end of a strenuous day at an\noffice I could look forward to joining my family at the dinnertable, and instead to take up the life of a man hunted continuously by the police, living separated from those who are\nclosest to me, in my own country, facing continually the hazards of detection and of arrest. This has been a life infinitely more difficult than serving a prison sentence. No man in his\nright senses would voluntarily choose such a life in preference to the one of normal, family, social life which exists in every civilized community.\nBut there comes a time, as it came in my life, when a man is denied the right to live a normal life, when he can only live the life of an outlaw because the government has so\ndecreed to use the law to impose a state of outlawry upon him. I was driven to this situation, and I do not regret having taken the decisions that I did take. Other people will be driven\nin the same way in this country, by this very same force of police persecution and of administrative action by the government, to follow my course, of that I am certain.\n\nI enumerated the many times that we had brought our grievances before the government and the equal number of times that we were ignored or\nshunted aside. I described our stay-away of  as a last resort after the government showed no signs of taking any steps to either talk with us or\nmeet our demands. It was the government that provoked violence by employing violence to meet our nonviolent demands. I explained that because\nof the government\u2019s actions we had taken a more militant stance. I said that I had been privileged throughout my political life to fight alongside\ncolleagues whose abilities and contributions were far greater than my own. Many others had paid the price of their beliefs before me, and many\nmore would do so after me.\nBefore sentencing, I informed the court that whatever sentence the state imposed, it would do nothing to change my devotion to the struggle.\nI do not believe, Your Worship, that this court, in inflicting penalties on me for the crimes for which I am convicted should be moved by the belief that penalties will deter men from\nthe course that they believe is right. History shows that penalties do not deter men when their conscience is aroused, nor will they deter my people or the colleagues with whom I\nhave worked before.\nI am prepared to pay the penalty even though I know how bitter and desperate is the situation of an African in the prisons of this country. I have been in these prisons and I know\nhow gross is the discrimination, even behind the prison wall, against Africans. . . . Nevertheless these considerations do not sway me from the path that I have taken nor will they\nsway others like me. For to men, freedom in their own land is the pinnacle of their ambitions, from which nothing can turn men of conviction aside. More powerful than my fear of the\ndreadful conditions to which I might be subjected in prison is my hatred for the dreadful conditions to which my people are subjected outside prison throughout this country. . . .\nWhatever sentence Your Worship sees fit to impose upon me for the crime for which I have been convicted before this court, may it rest assured that when my sentence has\nbeen completed I will still be moved, as men are always moved, by their conscience; I will still be moved by my dislike of the race discrimination against my people when I come out\nfrom serving my sentence, to take up again, as best I can, the struggle for the removal of those injustices until they are finally abolished once and for all. . . .\nI have done my duty to my people and to South Africa. I have no doubt that posterity will pronounce that I was innocent and that the criminals that should have been brought\nbefore this court are the members of the government.\n\nWhen I had finished, the magistrate ordered a ten-minute recess to consider the sentence. I turned and looked out at the crowd before exiting the\ncourtroom. I had no illusions about the sentence I would receive. Exactly ten minutes later, in a courtroom heavy with tension, the magistrate\npronounced sentence: three years for inciting people to strike and two years for leaving the country without a passport; five years in all, with no\npossibility of parole. It was a stern sentence and there was wailing among the spectators. As the court rose, I turned to the gallery and again made\na clenched fist, shouting \u201cAmandla!\u201d three times. Then, on its own, the crowd began to sing our beautiful anthem, \u201cNkosi Sikelel\u2019 iAfrika.\u201d People\nsang and danced and the women ululated as I was led away. The uproar among the gallery made me forget for a moment that I would be going to\nprison to serve what was then the stiffest sentence yet imposed in South Africa for a political offense.\nDownstairs, I was permitted a brief good-bye to Winnie, and on this occasion she was not at all grim: she was in high spirits and shed no tears.\nShe seemed confident, as much a comrade as a wife. She was determined to brace me. As I was driven away in the police van I could still hear the\npeople outside singing \u201cNkosi Sikelel\u2019 iAfrika.\u201d\n ONE NIGHT, toward the end of May, a warder came to my cell and ordered me to pack my things. I asked him why, but he did not answer. In less\nthan ten minutes, I was escorted down to the reception office where I found three other political prisoners: Tefu, John Gaetsewe, and Aaron Molete.\nColonel Aucamp curtly informed us that we were being transferred. Where? Tefu asked. Someplace very beautiful, Aucamp said. Where? said\nTefu. \u201cDie Eiland,\u201d said Aucamp. The island. There was only one. Robben Island.\nThe four of us were shackled together and put in a windowless van that contained only a sanitary bucket. We drove all night to Cape Town, and\narrived at the city\u2019s docks in the late afternoon. It is not an easy or pleasant task for men shackled together to use a sanitary bucket in a moving van.\nThe docks at Cape Town were swarming with armed police and nervous plainclothes officials. We had to stand, still chained, in the hold of the\nold wooden ferry, which was difficult as the ship rocked in the swells off the coast. A small porthole above was the only source of light and air. The\nporthole served another purpose as well: the warders enjoyed urinating on us from above. It was still light when we were led on deck and we saw\nthe island for the first time. Green and beautiful, it looked at first more like a resort than a prison.\nEsiquithini. At the island. That is how the Xhosa people describe the narrow, windswept outcrop of rock that lies eight miles off the coast of\nCape Town. Everyone knows which island you are referring to. I first heard about the island as a child. Robben Island was well known among the\nXhosas after Makanna (also known as Nxele), the six foot six inch commander of the Xhosa army in the Fourth Xhosa War, was banished there by\nthe British after leading ten thousand warriors against Grahamstown in . He tried to escape from Robben Island by boat, but drowned before\nreaching shore. The memory of that loss is woven into the language of my people who speak of a \u201cforlorn hope\u201d by the phrase \u201cUkuza kuka Nxele.\u201d\nMakanna was not the first African hero confined on the island. In , Autshumao, known to European historians as Harry the Strandloper, was\nbanished by Jan Van Riebeeck during a war between the Khoi Khoi and the Dutch. I took solace in the memory of Autshumao, for he is reputed to\nbe the first and only man to ever escape from Robben Island, and he did so by rowing to the mainland in a small boat.\nThe island takes its name from the Dutch word for seal, hundreds of which once cavorted in the icy Benguela currents that wash the shores. Later\nthe island was turned into a leper colony, a lunatic asylum, and a naval base. The government had only recently turned the island back into a prison.\n* * *\nWe were met by a group of burly white warders shouting: \u201cDis die Eiland! Hier gaan julle vrek!\u201d (This is the island. Here you will die.) Ahead of us\nwas a compound flanked by a number of guardhouses. Armed guards lined the path to the compound. It was extremely tense. A tall, red-faced\nwarder yelled at us: \u201cHier is ek jou baas?\u201d (Here I am your boss!) He was one of the notorious Kleynhans brothers, known for their brutality to\nprisoners. The warders always spoke in Afrikaans. If you replied in English they would say, \u201cEk verstaan nie daardie kafferboetie se taal nie.\u201d (I\ndon\u2019t understand that kaffir-lover\u2019s language.)\nAs we walked toward the prison, the guards shouted \u201cTwo-two! Two-two!\u201d \u2014 meaning we should walk in pairs, two in front, two behind. I linked up\nwith Tefu. The guards started screaming, \u201cHaas! . . . Haas?\u201d The word haas means \u201cmove\u201d in Afrikaans, but it is customarily reserved for cattle.\nThe warders were demanding that we jog, and I turned to Tefu and under my breath said that we must set an example; if we gave in now we\nwould be at their mercy. Tefu nodded his head in agreement. We had to show them that we were not everyday criminals but political prisoners\nbeing punished for our beliefs.\nI motioned to Tefu that we two should walk in front, and we took the lead. Once in front, we actually decreased the pace, walking slowly and\ndeliberately. The guards were incredulous. \u201cListen,\u201d Kleynhans said, \u201cthis is not Johannesburg, this is not Pretoria, this is Robben Island, and we will\ntolerate no insubordination here. Haas! Haas!\u201d But we continued at our stately pace. Kleynhans ordered us to halt, and stood in front of us: \u201cLook,\nman, we will kill you, we are not fooling around, your wives and children and mothers and fathers will never know what happened to you. This is the\nlast warning. Haas! Haas!\u201d\nTo this I said: \u201cYou have your duty and we have ours.\u201d I was determined that we would not give in, and we did not, for we were already at the cells.\nWe were ushered into a rectangular stone building and taken to a large open room. The floor was covered with water a few inches deep. The\nguards yelled: \u201cTrek uit! Trek uit!\u201d (Undress! Undress!) As we removed each item of clothing, the guards would grab it, search it quickly, and then\nthrow it in the water. Jacket off, searched, thrown in the water. Then the guards commanded us to get dressed, by which they meant for us to put on\nour soaking clothes.\nTwo officers entered the room. The less senior of the two was a captain whose name was Gericke. From the start, we could see that he was\nintent on manhandling us. The captain pointed to Aaron Molete, the youngest of the four of us and a very mild and gentle person, and said, \u201cWhy is\nyour hair so long?\u201d Aaron said nothing. The captain shouted, \u201cI\u2019m talking to you! Why is your hair so long? It is against regulations. Your hair should\nhave been cut. Why is it long . . .\u201d and then he paused and turned to look at me, and said, \u201c. . . like this boy\u2019s!\u201d pointing at me. I began to speak:\n\u201cNow, look here, the length of our hair is determined by the regulations . . .\u201d\nBefore I could finish, he shouted in disbelief: \u201cNever talk to me that way, boy!\u201d and began to advance. I was frightened; it is not a pleasant\nsensation to know that someone is about to hit you and you are unable to defend yourself.\nWhen he was just a few feet from me, I said, as firmly as I could, \u201cIf you so much as lay a hand on me, I will take you to the highest court in the land\nand when I finish with you, you will be as poor as a church mouse.\u201d The moment I began speaking, he paused, and by the end of my speech, he was\nstaring at me with astonishment. I was a bit surprised myself. I had been afraid, and spoke not from courage, but out of a kind of bravado. At such\ntimes, one must put up a bold front despite what one feels inside.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your ticket?\u201d he asked, and I handed it to him. I could see he was nervous. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he said. I nodded my head toward the\nticket, and said, \u201cIt is written there.\u201d He said, \u201cHow long are you in for?\u201d I said again, gesturing toward the ticket, \u201cIt is written there.\u201d He looked down\nand said, \u201cFive years! You are in for five years and you are so arrogant! Do you know what it means to serve five years?\u201d I said, \u201cThat is my\nbusiness. I am ready to serve five years but I am not prepared to be bullied. You must act within the law.\u201d\nNo one had informed him who we were, or that we were political prisoners, or that I was a lawyer. I had not noticed it myself, but the other officer,\na tall, quiet man, had vanished during our confrontation; I later discovered that he was Colonel Steyn, the commanding officer of Robben Island. The\ncaptain then left, much quieter than he had entered.\n\nWe were then by ourselves and Steve, his nerves jangling, could not stop speaking. \u201cWe have provoked the Boere,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we are in for a\nrough time.\u201d He was in the midst of speaking when a stocky fellow named Lieutenant Pretorius walked in. To our surprise, Pretorius spoke to us in\nXhosa, which he seemed to know quite well. \u201cWe have looked at your records and they are not so bad. All except this one,\u201d he said, nodding\n\n\ftoward Steve. \u201cYour record is filthy.\u201d\nSteve exploded. \u201cWho are you to talk to me like that? You say I have a filthy record. You have read my files, eh. Well, you will find that all those\nconvictions were for cases I was fighting for the rights of my people. I am not a criminal; you are the criminal.\u201d The lieutenant then warned Steve that\nhe would charge him if he ever addressed him in that way again. Before leaving, the lieutenant said he was placing us in a single large cell with\nwindows that faced outside and then added, rather ominously, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to talk to anyone through those windows, especially you,\nMandela.\u201d\nWe were then taken to our cell, one of the best I had ever seen. The windows were large and within easy reach. From one set of windows we\ncould see other prisoners and warders as they walked past. It was spacious, certainly large enough for the four of us, and had its own toilets and\nshowers.\nIt had been an exhausting day and a short while later, after a supper of cold porridge, the others went to sleep. I was lying on my blanket on the\nfloor, when I heard a tapping at the window. I looked up and saw a white man, beckoning me to come to the glass. I remembered the lieutenant\u2019s\nadmonition and stayed put.\nThen I heard the fellow whisper: \u201cNelson, come here.\u201d The fact that he knew my name intrigued me and I decided to take a chance. I went over to\nthe window and looked at him. He must have realized that I thought he was white, because the first thing he whispered was, \u201cI\u2019m a Coloured warder\nfrom Bloemfontein.\u201d He then gave me news of my wife. There had been a report in the Johannesburg newspapers that my wife had come to see me\nat Pretoria Local, but that they had not informed her that I had been taken to Robben Island. I thanked him for the information.\n\u201cDo you smoke?\u201d he said. I told him that I did not and he seemed disappointed. I then got the idea: \u201cYes, but my comrades do.\u201d He brightened at\nthis and said he would return in a few minutes with tobacco and sandwiches. Everyone was now awake. Tefu and John Gaetsewe smoked, and I\nsplit the pouch of tobacco between them, and we all divided the sandwiches.\nFor the next few weeks the Coloured warder came almost every night with tobacco and sandwiches. And each night I would divide up the\ntobacco evenly between Tefu and Gaetsewe. The warder was taking great risks, and he warned me that he was only prepared to deal directly with\nme, or the arrangement was off.\n\nWhen we arrived on the island we had no idea how many other prisoners were there. Within a few days we learned there were about a thousand\nmen, all Africans, all recent arrivals. Most of these men were common-law prisoners, but I knew there would be some political prisoners among\nthem. I wanted to contact them, but we were completely isolated. For the first few days we were kept locked in our cell and not even permitted\noutside. We demanded to be taken to work like the other prisoners, and this was soon granted, but we were taken out alone, supervised by\nKleynhans. Our first job was covering up some newly laid pipe and we were on a small hill and could see some of the island, which was wild and\nlovely.\nWe worked hard that first day, but on each succeeding day Kleynhans pushed us harder. He did this crudely, as one would urge on a horse or\ncow. \u201cNee, man. Kom aan! Gaan aan!\u201d (No, man. Come on. Go on.) At one point, Steve, who was older than the rest of us, put down his shovel and\nwas immediately threatened by Kleynhans. But Steve, in Afrikaans, responded: \u201cYou ignoramus who cannot even speak your own language\nproperly \u2014 you cannot tell me what to do. I will work at my own rate, that is what I am prepared to do, and that is all I can do.\u201d Then, with great\ndignity, he picked up his shovel and resumed work. Steve had been a teacher of Afrikaans, and he not only spoke perfect Afrikaans but its\nantecedent, High Dutch. Steve would speak to the warders in a condescending and grandiloquent style that they probably did not understand. But\nthey knew better than to engage him in a verbal battle.\nThere were two Kleynhans brothers on the island, both reputed to have viciously assaulted prisoners. We were looked after by the older brother,\nwho must have been warned to restrain himself, for he never touched us. The younger one was under no such constraints. One day, we were\nwalking back from work along a road and passed a workspan of several hundred prisoners carting sand in wheelbarrows. They were nonpolitical\nprisoners and both of our groups were ordered to halt while the two brothers had a chat; the younger brother ordered one of his men to polish his\nboots while he talked. I recognized some of the men in the other workspan as those who had been sentenced to death in the Sekhukhuneland\npeasant revolt of , and I turned around to get a better look at them. The younger brother rudely ordered me to look the other way. I do not know\nhow I would have reacted had I not been standing in full view of the other prisoners, but my pride was now at stake. I refused to turn around. The\nyounger Kleynhans advanced with the obvious intent of assaulting me, but when he was a few steps away, his brother ran over, grabbed him,\nwhispered a few words, and the incident passed.\nOne day we were visited by the head of prison, who was responsible for running all of Robben Island and had come to hear our complaints.\nTheron was a sour fellow who did not like to deal with prisoners face to face. I did not want to alienate him but I was not going to cringe. \u201cWe are\ngrateful that you have come to see us,\u201d I said, speaking for the group, \u201cbecause we have a number of problems which I am certain you will be able\nto sort out.\u201d I enumerated the problems and when I finished, he said, \u201cI will see what I can do.\u201d\nPerhaps he thought he had given in too easily because as he was walking out he turned to Tefu, who had a large belly, and said, \u201cJou groot pens\nsal in die plek verdwyn,\u201d Afrikaans for \u201cThat great stomach of yours is going to disappear here in prison.\u201d Pens means stomach, but is used to refer\nto the stomach of animals like sheep or cattle. The word for the stomach of a human being is maag.\nSteve did not take kindly to the prison head\u2019s jab, and he was incapable of letting an insult go unanswered. \u201cYou know, Captain,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\nis nothing you can do to me that can truly affect me for I am a member of the most revolutionary political organization in the world, the Communist\nParty, which has a distinguished record of service to oppressed people around the globe. You and your poor National Party will be on the ash-heap\nof history while we are ruling the world. I am better known internationally than your witless state president. Who are you? A small functionary not\neven worth paying attention to. By the time I leave prison I won\u2019t even know your name.\u201d Theron turned on his heel and left.\n\nThe nightly visits of our Coloured warder went a long way to mitigate the harshness of the island. But even with this luxury, Steve was still\ndissatisfied. Tefu was a heavy smoker; he would sometimes puff away the entire night, leaving himself no tobacco for the next day. Gaetsewe,\nhowever, conserved his tobacco, and never ran out. One evening, in a particularly irritable mood, Tefu confronted me. \u201cNelson,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are\nshortchanging me. You are giving Gaetsewe more tobacco than me.\u201d\nThis was not true, but I thought I would play a game with him. \u201cVery well then,\u201d I said. \u201cEvery night when I get the tobacco I will first divide it into two\nportions and then I will let you choose which one you want.\u201d That night, and each night afterward, I separated the tobacco into equal piles and said\nto Steve, \u201cChoose.\u201d\nTefu would be in an agony of indecision. He would look at both piles, his head swinging back and forth between the two. Finally, in frustration, he\n\n\fwould grab one of the piles and go off and begin to smoke. Though this process seemed to me eminently fair \u2014 and also humorous \u2014 Tefu was\nstill unhappy. He began to hover about when the warder came to the window in order to make sure that I was not hoarding the tobacco. This made\nthe warder uncomfortable. \u201cLook,\u201d he said to me, \u201cI only deal with you. It is a question of security.\u201d I said I understood, and told Tefu that he could not\nbe around when I was dealing with the warder.\nThe next night, however, when the warder came to the window, Tefu strode up to the bars and said to him, \u201cFrom now on I want my own tobacco.\nJust give it to me directly.\u201d The warder panicked. \u201cMandela,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have broken our agreement. No more. I won\u2019t be bringing you these\nthings.\u201d I shooed Tefu away and remonstrated with the warder. I said, \u201cLook, man, this is an old chap,\u201d meaning Tefu. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not very normal,\u201d I\nsaid pointing to my head. \u201cMake an exception.\u201d So he softened and gave me the supplies, but warned if it happened again, that would be the end.\nThat night, I thought it necessary to punish Tefu. I said, \u201cNow, look, you have jeopardized our supplies. You are not going to have any tobacco or\nsandwiches tonight. You have almost lost us these privileges. So we\u2019re cutting you off until you improve.\u201d Tefu was silent.\nWe stayed in one corner of the cell that night, eating our sandwiches and reading the paper the warder also brought for us. Tefu sat by himself in\nthe opposite corner. Eventually we drifted off to sleep. At about midnight, I felt an arm on my shoulder, jostling me awake. \u201cNelson . . . Nelson.\u201d It was\nTefu.\n\u201cNelson,\u201d he said, speaking softly, \u201cyou have hit me in a weak spot. You have deprived me of my tobacco. I am an old man. I have suffered for my\ncommitment to my people. You are the leader here in jail, and you are punishing me like this. It is not fair, Nelson.\u201d\nHe had hit me in a weak spot. I felt as though I had abused my power. He had indeed suffered, far more than I had. I had not eaten half my\nsandwich, and I immediately gave it to him. I roused Gaetsewe \u2014 I had given him all the tobacco \u2014 and asked him if he would share it with Tefu.\nTefu was always difficult, but from that point on he behaved much better.\n\nOnce we started working, I got some sense of what life was like for other prisoners on the island. The authorities also moved some young political\nprisoners from the PAC into the cells opposite ours. At night, we were able to talk with them through the barred door. Among these young men, I\ndiscovered, was Nqabeni Menye, a nephew of mine from Mqhekezweni whom I had last seen when he was a baby in .\nWe conversed about the Transkei and caught up on family history. One night, while his friends were gathered around him, he said, \u201cUncle, what\norganization do you belong to?\u201d The ANC, I said, of course. My response caused consternation among those young men and suddenly their faces\ndisappeared from the window. After some time, my nephew reappeared and asked me whether or not I had ever been a member of the PAC. I\nreplied that I had not. He then said he had understood that I joined the PAC during my Africa tour. I told him that I had not, that I had always been a\nmember of the ANC, and that I always would be. This again caused dismay among them and they vanished.\nI later learned that PAC propaganda claimed that I had joined the organization when I was traveling elsewhere on the continent. Although I was\nnot pleased to hear this, it did not surprise me. In politics, one can never underestimate how little people know about a situation. A short while later\nmy nephew was back and asked me if I had met and talked with Sobukwe at Pretoria Local. I said that I had and that we had very good\ndiscussions. This pleased them and they said good night, and that was the last I saw of them.\n\nA few hours later that same evening a captain came to our cell and commanded the four of us to pack our belongings. Within minutes my comrades\nwere taken away, leaving me in the cell by myself. In prison, one counts oneself lucky to be able to wave good-bye to one\u2019s comrades. One can be\nin extraordinarily intimate circumstances with someone for months, and then never see the person again. It is dehumanizing, for it forces one to\nadapt by becoming more self-contained and insulated.\nNow that I was alone, I was also somewhat anxious. There is sometimes safety in numbers; when you are alone, there are no witnesses. I\nrealized I had not been served any food, and banged on the door: \u201cWarder, I have not received my supper.\u201d\n\u201cYou must call me baas,\u201d he yelled. I went hungry that night.\nVery early the next morning I was taken back to Pretoria. The Department of Prisons released a statement to the press that I had been removed\nfrom the island for my own safety because PAC prisoners were planning to assault me. This was patently false; they had brought me back to\nPretoria for their own motives, which soon became clear.\nI was kept in solitary confinement at Pretoria Local. But prisoners are resourceful and I was soon receiving secret notes and other\ncommunications from some of the ANC people there. I had a communication from Henry Fazzie, one of the MK cadres who had undergone military\ntraining in Ethiopia and been arrested while attempting to return to South Africa. They were among the first ANC members to be tried under the\nSabotage Act.\nThrough the prison grapevine, I attempted to help them with their defense and suggested they contact Harold Wolpe. I later heard that Wolpe was\nin police detention. This was my first intimation that something had gone seriously wrong. One day, as I was being led away from the courtyard after\nexercise, I saw Andrew Mlangeni. I had last seen him in September of  when he was leaving the country for military training. Wolpe, Mlangeni\n\u2014 who else was under arrest?\nEarly in , Winnie had been banned for two years. I heard from another prisoner that Winnie had recently been charged with violating her\nbans, which could lead to imprisonment or house arrest. Winnie was headstrong; a banning order was just the type of thing that would make her\nangry. I had no doubt that she violated her orders, and I would never counsel her not to do so, but it concerned me greatly that she might spend time\nin prison.\nOne morning in July , as I was walking along the passage to my cell, I saw Thomas Mashifane, who had been the foreman at Liliesleaf\nFarm. I greeted him warmly, though I realized that the authorities had undoubtedly led him to my passage to see if I recognized or acknowledged\nhim. I could not help but do otherwise. His presence there could mean only one thing: the authorities had discovered Rivonia.\nA day or two later I was summoned to the prison office where I found Walter; Govan Mbeki; Ahmed Kathrada; Andrew Mlangeni; Bob Hepple;\nRaymond Mhlaba, a member of the MK High Command who had recently returned from training in China; Elias Motsoaledi, also a member of MK;\nDennis Goldberg, an engineer and a member of the Congress of Democrats; Rusty Bernstein, an architect and also a member of the COD; and\nJimmy Kantor, an attorney who was Harold Wolpe\u2019s brother-in-law. We were all charged with sabotage, and scheduled to appear in court the next\nday. I had served just nine months of my five-year sentence.\n\nIn bits and pieces, I learned what had happened. On the afternoon of July , a dry cleaner\u2019s van entered the long driveway of the farm. No one at\nLiliesleaf had ordered a delivery. The vehicle was stopped by a young African guard, but he was overwhelmed when dozens of armed policemen\n\n\fand several police dogs sprang from the vehicle. They surrounded the property and a handful of officers entered the main building and the principal\noutbuilding. In the latter they found a dozen men around a table discussing a document. Walter jumped out a window but was cut off by a snarling\npolice dog. The arrests also included Arthur Goldreich, who had driven into the farm as the police raid was in progress.\nThe police searched the entire farm and confiscated hundreds of documents and papers, though they found no weapons. One of the most\nimportant documents remained right on the table: Operation Mayibuye, a plan for guerrilla warfare in South Africa. In one fell swoop, the police had\ncaptured the entire High Command of Umkhonto we Sizwe. Everyone was detained under the new Ninety-Day Detention Law.\nJoe Slovo and Bram Fischer were fortunately not there at the time of the raid. But Joe and Bram often went to the farm two or three times a day.\nIn hindsight, it is extraordinary that Liliesleaf was not discovered sooner. The regime had become stricter and more sophisticated. Wiretaps had\nbecome common, as was twenty-four-hour surveillance. The raid was a coup for the state.\n\nOn our first day in court we were not given the opportunity to instruct counsel. We were brought before a magistrate and charged with sabotage. A\nfew days later we were allowed to meet with Bram, Vernon Berrang\u00e9, Joel Joffe, George Bizos, and Arthur Chaskalson, all of whom were acting for\nus. I was still being kept separately as I was a convicted prisoner, and these sessions were my first opportunity to talk with my colleagues.\nBram was very somber. In his quiet voice, he told us that we were facing an extremely serious trial and that the state had formally advised him\nthey would ask for the supreme penalty permitted by law, the death sentence. Given the climate of the times, Bram said, this result was a very real\npossibility. From that moment on we lived in the shadow of the gallows. The mere possibility of a death sentence changes everything. From the\nstart, we considered it the most likely outcome of the trial. Far lesser crimes than ours had recently been punished by life sentences.\nPrison officials never let you forget that you might hang. That night, a warder rapped on my cell door at bedtime. \u201cMandela, you don\u2019t have to\nworry about sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are going to sleep for a long, long time.\u201d I waited a moment and said, \u201cAll of us, you included, are going to sleep\nfor a long, long time.\u201d It was small consolation. THE STATE CASE continued through the Christmas season of , ending on February , . We had a little over a month to examine the\nevidence and prepare our defense. We were not all equally affected by the evidence. There was no evidence against James Kantor; he was not\neven a member of our organization and should not have been on trial at all. For Rusty Bernstein, Raymond Mhlaba, and Ahmed Kathrada, the\nevidence of involvement in conspiracy was slight and we decided they should not incriminate themselves. In Rusty\u2019s case, the evidence was\nnegligible; he had merely been found at Rivonia with the others. The remaining six of us would make admissions of guilt on certain charges.\nBram was deeply pessimistic. He avowed that even if we proved that guerrilla war had not been approved and our policy of sabotage was\ndesigned not to sacrifice human life, the state could still impose the death sentence. The defense team was divided on whether or not we should\ntestify. Some asserted that it would hurt our case if we testified. George Bizos, though, suggested that unless we gave evidence and convinced the\njudge that we had not decided on guerrilla warfare, he would certainly impose the supreme penalty.\nRight from the start we had made it clear that we intended to use the trial not as a test of the law but as a platform for our beliefs. We would not\ndeny, for example, that we had been responsible for acts of sabotage. We would not deny that a group of us had turned away from nonviolence. We\nwere not concerned with getting off or lessening our punishment, but with having the trial strengthen the cause for which we were all struggling \u2014 at\nwhatever cost to ourselves. We would not defend ourselves in a legal sense so much as in a moral sense. We saw the trial as a continuation of the\nstruggle by other means. We would readily admit what was known by the state to be true but refuse to give away any information we thought might\nimplicate others.\nWe would dispute the state\u2019s central contention that we had embarked on guerrilla warfare. We would admit that we had made contingency plans\nto undertake guerrilla warfare in the event sabotage failed. But we would claim it had not yet failed, for it had not been sufficiently attempted. We\nwould deny the claims of murder and damage to innocent bystanders that the state alleged; either these claims were outright lies, or the incidents\nwere the work of someone else. We had never contemplated the intervention of foreign military forces. In order to make these claims, we believed\nwe would have to explain Operation Mayibuye to the court.\nIn my own case, the court had sufficient evidence for a conviction. Documents in my handwriting showed that I had left the country illegally, had\narranged for military training for our men, and had been behind the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe. There was also a document in my handwriting\ncalled \u201cHow to be a good Communist,\u201d which the state suggested was proof that I was a card-carrying Communist. In fact the document\u2019s title was\ntaken from the work of a Chinese theoretician named Liu Shao Chi, and was written by me to prove a point to Moses Kotane. We had been\nengaged in a running debate about the appeal of communism to ordinary South Africans. I had long argued that Communist literature was, for the\nmost part, dull, esoteric, and Western-centered, but ought to be simple, clear, and relevant to the African masses. Moses insisted it could not be\ndone. To prove my point, I had taken Liu\u2019s essay and rewritten it for an African audience.\n\nI would be the first witness and therefore set the tone for the defense. In South African courts, evidence from the witness box can be given only in the\nform of an answer to a question. I did not want to be limited to that format. We decided that instead of giving testimony, I would read a statement\nfrom the dock, while the others would testify and go through cross-examination.\nBecause a witness making a statement from the dock does not submit to cross-examination or questions from the bench, the statement does not\nhave the same legal weight as ordinary testimony. Those who choose to make such a statement usually do so to avoid cross-examination. Our\nattorneys warned me that it would put me in a more precarious legal situation; anything I said in my statement regarding my own innocence would\nbe discounted by the judge. But that was not our highest priority. We believed it was important to open the defense with a statement of our politics\nand ideals, which would establish the context for all that followed. I wanted very much to cross swords with Percy Yutar, but it was more important\nthat I use the platform to highlight our grievances.\nAll of this was agreed upon in consultation, mainly through notes because the consultation room was bugged. We even used the state\u2019s\neavesdropping to our advantage by supplying them with disinformation. We gave every indication that I was going to testify so that they would\nspend their time planning their cross-examination. In a staged conversation, I told our attorney Joel Joffe that I would need the Treason Trial record\nto prepare my testimony. We smiled at the notion of Yutar poring over the hundred or so volumes of Treason Trial transcripts.\n\nI spent about a fortnight drafting my address, working mainly in my cell in the evenings. When I was finished, I read it first to my comrades and fellow\naccused. They approved of it, suggesting a few changes, and then I asked Bram Fischer to look it over. Bram became concerned after reading it\nand had a respected advocate named Hal Hanson read it. Hanson told Bram, \u201cIf Mandela reads this in court they will take him straight out in back of\nthe courthouse and string him up.\u201d That confirmed Bram\u2019s anxieties and he came to me the next day and urged me to modify the speech. I felt we\nwere likely to hang no matter what we said, so we might as well say what we truly believed. The atmosphere at the time was extremely grim, with\nnewspapers routinely speculating that we would receive the death sentence. Bram begged me not to read the final paragraph, but I was adamant.\n\nOn Monday, the twentieth of April, under the tightest of security, we were taken to the Palace of Justice, this time to begin our defense. Winnie was\nthere with my mother, and I nodded to them as we entered the court, which was again full.\nBram announced that certain parts of the state\u2019s evidence would be conceded by the accused, and there was a buzz in the court. But he went on\nto say that the defense would deny a number of the state\u2019s assertions, including the contention that Umkhonto we Sizwe was the military wing of the\nANC. He said that the leaders of MK and the ANC \u201cendeavored to keep these two organizations entirely separate. They did not always succeed in\nthis,\u201d he said, \u201cbut . . . every effort was made to achieve that object.\u201d He emphatically denied that the ANC took orders from the Communist Party.\nHe said the defense would challenge the allegation that Goldberg, Kathrada, Bernstein, and Mhlaba were members of Umkhonto. He stated that\nthe defense would show that Umkhonto had not in fact adopted Operation Mayibuye, and that MK had not embarked on preparations for guerrilla\nwarfare.\n\u201cThat will be denied?\u201d asked Justice de Wet incredulously.\n\u201cThat will be denied,\u201d replied Bram. \u201cThe evidence will show that while preparations for guerrilla warfare were being made, no plan was ever\nadopted. It was hoped throughout that such a step could be avoided.\u201d\nThen, in his soft voice, Bram said, \u201cThe defense case, My Lord, will commence with a statement from the dock by accused number one, who\n\n\fpersonally took part in the establishment of Umkhonto, and who will be able to inform the court of the beginnings of that organization.\u201d\nAt this, Yutar popped up from the table and cried, \u201cMy Lord! My Lord!\u201d He was distressed that I would not be testifying for he had undoubtedly\nprepared for my cross-examination. \u201cMy Lord,\u201d he said rather despondently, \u201ca statement from the dock does not carry the same weight as\nevidence under oath.\u201d\n\u201cI think, Dr. Yutar,\u201d Justice de Wet responded dryly, \u201cthat counsel for the defense have sufficient experience to advise their clients without your\nassistance.\u201d Yutar sat down.\n\u201cNeither we nor our clients are unaware of the provisions of the criminal code,\u201d replied Bram. \u201cI call on Nelson Mandela.\u201d\nI rose and faced the courtroom and read slowly.\nI am the first accused.\nI hold a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Arts, and practiced as an attorney in Johannesburg for a number of years in partnership with Mr. Oliver Tambo. I am a convicted prisoner, serving\nfive years for leaving the country without a permit and for inciting people to go on strike at the end of May .\nI admit immediately that I was one of the persons who helped to form Umkhonto we Sizwe and that I played a prominent role in its affairs until I was arrested in August .\nAt the outset, I want to say that the suggestion made by the state in its opening that the struggle in South Africa is under the influence of foreigners or Communists is wholly\nincorrect. I have done whatever I did, both as an individual and as a leader of my people, because of my experience in South Africa, and my own proudly felt African background, and\nnot because of what any outsider might have said.\nIn my youth in the Transkei, I listened to the elders of my tribe telling stories of the old days. Amongst the tales they related to me were those of wars fought by our ancestors in\ndefense of the fatherland. The names of Dingane and Bambatha, Hintsa and Makanna, Squngthi and Dalasile, Moshoeshoe and Sekhukhuni, were praised as the pride and glory\nof the entire African nation. I hoped then that life might offer me the opportunity to serve my people and make my own humble contribution to their freedom struggle. This is what has\nmotivated me in all that I have done in relation to the charges made against me in this case.\nHaving said this, I must deal immediately and at some length with the question of violence. Some of the things so far told the court are true and some are untrue. I do not,\nhowever, deny that I planned sabotage. I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness nor because I have any love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment\nof the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, exploitation, and oppression of my people by whites.\n\nI wanted to impress upon the court that we had not acted irresponsibly or without thought to the ramifications of taking up violent action. I laid\nparticular emphasis on our resolve to cause no harm to human life.\nWe of the ANC have always stood for a nonracial democracy, and we shrank from any action which might drive the races further apart than they already were. But the hard facts\nwere that fifty years of nonviolence had brought the African people nothing but more repressive legislation, and fewer and fewer rights. It may not be easy for this court to\nunderstand, but it is a fact that for a long time the people had been talking of violence \u2014 of the day when they would fight the white man and win back their country, and we, the\nleaders of the ANC, had nevertheless always prevailed upon them to avoid violence and to use peaceful methods. While some of us discussed this in May and June of , it\ncould not be denied that our policy to achieve a nonracial state by nonviolence had achieved nothing, and that our followers were beginning to lose confidence in this policy and\nwere developing disturbing ideas of terrorism. . . .\nUmkhonto was formed in November . When we took this decision, and subsequently formulated our plans, the ANC heritage of nonviolence and racial harmony was very\nmuch with us. We felt that the country was drifting towards a civil war in which blacks and whites would fight each other. We viewed the situation with alarm. Civil war would mean\nthe destruction of what the ANC stood for; with civil war racial peace would be more difficult than ever to achieve. We already have examples in South African history of the results of\nwar. It has taken more than fifty years for the scars of the South African [Anglo-Boer] War to disappear. How much longer would it take to eradicate the scars of interracial civil war,\nwhich could not be fought without a great loss of life on both sides?\n\nSabotage, I said, offered the best hope for future race relations. The reaction of the white rulers to our first efforts was swift and brutal: sabotage\nwas declared to be a crime punishable by death. We did not want civil war, I said, but we needed to be prepared for it.\nExperience convinced us that rebellion would offer the government limitless opportunities for the indiscriminate slaughter of our people. But it was precisely because the soil of\nSouth Africa is already drenched with the blood of innocent Africans that we felt it our duty to make preparations as a long-term undertaking to use force in order to defend ourselves\nagainst force. If war were inevitable, we wanted the fight to be conducted on terms most favorable to our people. The fight which held out prospects best for us and the least risk of\nlife to both sides was guerrilla warfare. We decided, therefore, in our preparations for the future, to make provision for the possibility of guerrilla warfare.\nAll whites undergo compulsory military training, but no such training was given to Africans. It was in our view essential to build up a nucleus of trained men who would be able to\nprovide the leadership which would be required if guerrilla warfare started. We had to prepare for such a situation before it became too late to make proper preparations.\n\nI explained that at this stage in our discussions I left the country to attend the PAFMECSA conference and undergo military training. I said that I\nunderwent training because if there was to be a guerrilla war, I wanted to be able to stand and fight beside my own people. Even so, I believed that\nthe possibilities of sabotage were far from exhausted and should be pursued with vigor.\nI told the court of the dividing line between the ANC and MK, and how we made good-faith attempts to keep the two separate. This was our\npolicy, but in practice, it was not so simple. Because of bannings and imprisonment, people often had to work in both organizations. Though this\nmight have sometimes blurred the distinction, it did not abolish it. I disputed the allegations of the state that the aims and objects of the ANC and\nthe Communist Party were one and the same.\nThe ideological creed of the ANC is, and always has been, the creed of African Nationalism. It is not the concept of African Nationalism expressed in the cry, \u201cDrive the white man\ninto the sea.\u201d The African Nationalism for which the ANC stands is the concept of freedom and fulfillment for the African people in their own land. The most important political\ndocument ever adopted by the ANC is the Freedom Charter. It is by no means a blueprint for a socialist state. . . . The ANC has never at any period of its history advocated a\nrevolutionary change in the economic structure of the country, nor has it, to the best of my recollection, ever condemned capitalist society. . . .\nThe ANC, unlike the Communist Party, admitted Africans only as members. Its chief goal was, and is, for the African people to win unity and full political rights. The Communist\nParty\u2019s main aim, on the other hand, was to remove the capitalists and to replace them with a working-class government. The Communist Party sought to emphasize class\ndistinctions whilst the ANC seeks to harmonize them.\nIt is true that there has often been close cooperation between the ANC and the Communist Party. But cooperation is merely proof of a common goal \u2014 in this case the removal\nof white supremacy \u2014 and is not proof of a complete community of interests. The history of the world is full of similar examples. Perhaps the most striking illustration is to be found\nin the cooperation between Great Britain, the United States of America and the Soviet Union in the fight against Hitler. Nobody but Hitler would have dared to suggest that such\ncooperation turned Churchill or Roosevelt into Communists or Communist tools, or that Britain and America were working to bring about a Communist world. . . .\nIt is perhaps difficult for white South Africans, with an ingrained prejudice against communism, to understand why experienced African politicians so readily accepted\nCommunists as their friends. But to us the reason is obvious. Theoretical differences amongst those fighting against oppression is a luxury we cannot afford at this stage. What is\nmore, for many decades Communists were the only political group in South Africa who were prepared to treat Africans as human beings and their equals; who were prepared to\neat with us; talk with us, live with and work with us. Because of this, there are many Africans who, today, tend to equate freedom with communism.\n\nI told the court that I was not a Communist and had always regarded myself as an African patriot. I did not deny that I was attracted by the idea of\na classless society, or that I had been influenced by Marxist thought. This was true of many leaders of the newly independent states of Africa, who\naccepted the need for some form of socialism to enable their people to catch up with the advanced countries of the West.\nFrom my reading of Marxist literature and from conversations with Marxists, I have gained the impression that Communists regard the parliamentary system of the West as\nundemocratic and reactionary. But, on the contrary, I am an admirer of such a system.\nThe Magna Carta, the Petition of Rights and the Bill of Rights, are documents which are held in veneration by democrats throughout the world. I have great respect for British\npolitical institutions, and for the country\u2019s system of justice. I regard the British Parliament as the most democratic institution in the world, and the independence and impartiality of\n\n\fits judiciary never fail to arouse my admiration. The American Congress, the country\u2019s doctrine of separation of powers, as well as the independence of its judiciary, arouse in me\nsimilar sentiments.\n\nI detailed the terrible disparities between black and white life in South Africa. In education, health, income, every aspect of life, blacks were\nbarely at a subsistence level while whites had the highest standards in the world \u2014 and aimed to keep it that way. Whites, I said, often claim that\nAfricans in South Africa were better off than Africans in the rest of the continent. Our complaint, I said, was not that we were poor by comparison\nwith the people in the rest of Africa, but that we were poor by comparison with the whites in our country, and that we were prevented by legislation\nfrom righting that imbalance.\nThe lack of human dignity experienced by Africans is the direct result of the policy of white supremacy. White supremacy implies black inferiority. Legislation designed to preserve\nwhite supremacy entrenches this notion. Menial tasks in South Africa are invariably performed by Africans. When anything has to be carried or cleaned the white man looks around\nfor an African to do it for him, whether the African is employed by him or not. . . .\nPoverty and the breakdown of family life have secondary effects. Children wander about the streets of the townships because they have no schools to go to, or no money to\nenable them to go to school, or no parents at home to see that they go to school, because both parents (if there be two) have to work to keep the family alive. This leads to a\nbreakdown in moral standards, to an alarming rise in illegitimacy and to growing violence which erupts, not only politically, but everywhere. . . .\nAfricans want a just share in the whole of South Africa; they want security and a stake in society. Above all, we want equal political rights, because without them our disabilities\nwill be permanent. I know this sounds revolutionary to the whites in this country, because the majority of voters will be Africans. This makes the white man fear democracy. . . .\nThis then is what the ANC is fighting for. Their struggle is a truly national one. It is a struggle of the African people, inspired by their own suffering and their own experience. It is a\nstruggle for the right to live.\n\nI had been reading my speech, and at this point I placed my papers on the defense table, and turned to face the judge. The courtroom became\nextremely quiet. I did not take my eyes off Justice de Wet as I spoke from memory the final words.\nDuring my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have\ncherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.\nBut if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.\n\nThe silence in the courtroom was now complete. At the end of the address, I simply sat down. I did not turn and face the gallery, though I felt all\ntheir eyes on me. The silence seemed to stretch for many minutes. But in fact it lasted probably no more than thirty seconds, and then from the\ngallery I heard what sounded like a great sigh, a deep, collective \u201cummmm,\u201d followed by the cries of women.\nI had read for over four hours. It was a little after four in the afternoon, the time court normally adjourned. But Justice de Wet, as soon as there was\norder in the courtroom, asked for the next witness. He was determined to lessen the impact of my statement. He did not want it to be the last and\nonly testimony of the day. But nothing he did could weaken its effect. When I finished my address and sat down, it was the last time that Justice de\nWet ever looked me in the eye.\nThe speech received wide publicity in both the local and foreign press, and was printed, virtually word for word, in the Rand Daily Mail. This\ndespite the fact that all my words were banned. The speech both indicated our line of defense and disarmed the prosecution, which had prepared\nits entire case based on the expectation that I would be giving evidence denying responsibility for sabotage. It was now plain that we would not\nattempt to use legal niceties to avoid accepting responsibility for actions we had taken with pride and premeditation.\n\nAccused number two, Walter Sisulu, was next. Walter had to bear the brunt of the cross-examination that Yutar had prepared for me. Walter\nwithstood a barrage of hostile questions and rose above Yutar\u2019s petty machinations to explain our policy in clear and simple terms. He asserted\nthat Operation Mayibuye and the policy of guerrilla warfare had not been adopted as ANC policy. In fact, Walter told the court that he had personally\nopposed its adoption on the grounds that it was premature.\nGovan followed Walter in the witness box and proudly related to the court his longtime membership in the Communist Party. The prosecutor\nasked Govan why, if he admitted many of the actions in the four counts against him, he did not simply plead guilty to the four counts? \u201cFirst,\u201d Govan\nsaid, \u201cI felt I should come and explain under oath some of the reasons that led me to join these organizations. There was a sense of moral duty\nattached to it. Secondly, for the simple reason that to plead guilty would to my mind indicate a sense of moral guilt. I do not accept there is moral\nguilt attached to my answers.\u201d\nLike Govan, Ahmed Kathrada and Rusty Bernstein testified to their membership of the Communist Party as well as the ANC. Although Rusty was\ncaptured at Rivonia during the raid, the only evidence of a direct nature that the state had against him was that he had assisted in the erection of a\nradio aerial at the farm. Kathy, in his sharp-witted testimony, denied committing acts of sabotage or inciting others to do so, but he said he\nsupported such acts if they advanced the struggle.\nWe had all been surprised when accused number eight, James Kantor, had been arrested and grouped with us. Apart from being the brother-inlaw and legal partner of Harold Wolpe, who performed a number of transactions for us through his office, he had no involvement whatsoever with the\nANC or MK. There was virtually no evidence against him, and I assumed the only reason the state kept up the charade of prosecuting him in prison\nwas to intimidate progressive lawyers.\nOn the day that Justice de Wet was to rule on Jimmy\u2019s case, we were waiting in the cells underneath the court and I said to Jimmy, \u201cLet us\nexchange ties for good luck.\u201d But when he saw the wide, old-fashioned tie I gave him compared to the lovely, silk tie he gave me, he probably\nthought I was merely trying to improve my wardrobe. Jimmy was something of a clotheshorse, but he wore the tie to court and when Justice de Wet\ndismissed the charges against him, he lifted the tie up to me as a kind of salute and farewell.\nRaymond Mhlaba was one of the leading ANC and MK figures in the eastern Cape, but because the state did not have much evidence against\nhim, he denied he was a member of MK and that he knew anything about sabotage. We all decided that neither Elias Motsoaledi, accused number\nnine, nor Andrew Mlangeni, accused number ten, should testify. They were low-level members of MK, and could not add much to what had already\nbeen said. Elias Motsoaledi, despite having been beaten and tortured in prison, never broke down. Andrew Mlangeni, the last accused, made an\nunsworn statement admitting that he carried messages and instructions for MK and had disguised himself as a priest to facilitate this work. He, too,\ninformed the court that he had been assaulted while in prison, and subjected to electric shock treatment. Andrew was the last witness. The defense\nrested. All that remained were the final arguments and then judgment.\n\nOn the twentieth of May, Yutar handed out a dozen blue leather-bound volumes of his final speech to the press and one to the defense. Despite its\nhandsome packaging, Yutar\u2019s address was a garbled summary of the prosecution\u2019s case and did not explain the indictment or assess the\n\n\fevidence. It was filled with ad hominem insults. \u201cThe deceit of the accused is amazing,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cAlthough they represented scarcely\n% of the Bantu population they took it upon themselves to tell the world that the Africans in South Africa are suppressed, oppressed and\ndepressed.\u201d Even Judge de Wet seemed mystified by Yutar\u2019s speech, and at one point interrupted him to say, \u201cMr. Yutar, you do concede that you\nfailed to prove guerrilla warfare was ever decided upon, do you not?\u201d\nYutar was stunned. He had assumed precisely the opposite. We were surprised as well, for the judge\u2019s question gave us hope. Yutar haltingly\ntold the court that preparations for guerrilla warfare were indeed made.\n\u201cYes, I know that,\u201d de Wet replied impatiently, \u201cthe defense concedes that. But they say that prior to their arrest they took no decision to engage in\nguerrilla warfare. I take it that you have no evidence contradicting that and that you accept it?\u201d\n\u201cAs Your Worship wishes,\u201d Yutar said in a strangled voice.\nYutar finished by saying that the case was not only one of high treason \u201cpar excellence,\u201d but of murder and attempted murder \u2014 neither of which\nwas mentioned in the indictment. In a fit of bluster, he proclaimed, \u201cI make bold to say that every particular allegation in the indictment has been\nproved.\u201d He knew, even as he uttered those words, that they were patently false.\n\nDefense counsel Arthur Chaskalson rose first to deal with some of the legal questions raised by the prosecution. He rejected Yutar\u2019s statement that\nthe trial had anything to do with murder, and reminded the court that MK\u2019s express policy was that there should be no loss of life. When Arthur\nbegan to explain that other organizations committed acts of sabotage for which the accused were blamed, de Wet interrupted to say he already\naccepted that as a fact. This was another unexpected victory.\nBram Fischer spoke next and was prepared to tackle the state\u2019s two most serious contentions: that we had undertaken guerrilla warfare and that\nthe ANC and MK were the same. Though de Wet had said he believed that guerrilla warfare had not yet begun, we were taking no chances. But as\nBram launched into his first point, de Wet interjected somewhat testily, \u201cI thought I made my attitude clear. I accept that no decision or date was\nfixed upon for guerrilla warfare.\u201d\nWhen Bram began his second point, de Wet again interrupted him to say that he also conceded the fact that the two organizations were\nseparate. Bram, who was usually prepared for anything, was hardly prepared for de Wet\u2019s response. He then sat down; the judge had accepted his\narguments even before he made them. We were jubilant \u2014 that is, if men facing the death sentence can be said to be jubilant. Court was adjourned\nfor three weeks while de Wet considered the verdict. THE WORLD had been paying attention to the Rivonia Trial. Night-long vigils were held for us at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London. The students of\nLondon University elected me president of their Students\u2019 Union, in absentia. A group of experts at the U.N. urged a national convention for South\nAfrica that would lead to a truly representative parliament, and recommended an amnesty for all opponents of apartheid. Two days before Judge de\nWet was due to give his decision, the U.N. Security Council (with four abstentions, including Great Britain and the United States) urged the South\nAfrican government to end the trial and grant amnesty to the defendants.\nIn the days before we were due to reconvene, I wrote papers for a set of London University examinations for my LL.B. It might seem odd that I\nwas taking law exams a few days before the verdict. It certainly seemed bizarre to my guards, who said I would not need a law degree where I was\ngoing. But I had continued my studies through the trial and I wanted to take the examinations. I was single-minded about it, and I later realized that it\nwas a way to keep myself from thinking negatively. I knew I would not be practicing law again very soon, but I did not want to consider the\nalternative. I passed the exams.\n\nOn Thursday, June , We reassembled in the Palace of Justice for the verdict. We knew that for at least six of us, there could be no verdict but\nguilty. The question was the sentence.\nDe Wet wasted no time in getting down to business. He spoke in low, rapid tones. \u201cI have recorded the reasons for the conclusions I have come\nto. I do not propose to read them out.\n\u201cAccused number one is found guilty on all four counts. Accused number two is found guilty on all four counts. Accused number three is found\nguilty on all four counts. . . .\u201d\nDe Wet pronounced each of the main accused guilty on all counts. Kathy was found guilty on only one of four counts, and Rusty Bernstein was\nfound not guilty and discharged.\n\u201cI do not propose to deal with the question of sentence today,\u201d de Wet said. \u201cThe state and the defense will be given opportunities to make any\nsubmission they want tomorrow morning at ten o\u2019clock.\u201d Court was then adjourned.\nWe had hoped that Kathy and Mhlaba might escape conviction, but it was another sign, if one was necessary, that the state was taking a harsh\nline. If he could convict Mhlaba on all four counts with little evidence, could the death sentence be far behind for those of us against whom the\nevidence was overwhelming?\n\nThat night, after a discussion among ourselves, Walter, Govan, and I informed counsel that whatever sentences we received, even the death\nsentence, we would not appeal. Our decision stunned our lawyers. Walter, Govan, and I believed an appeal would undermine the moral stance we\nhad taken. We had from the first maintained that what we had done, we had done proudly, and for moral reasons. We were not now going to\nsuggest otherwise in an appeal. If a death sentence was passed, we did not want to hamper the mass campaign that would surely spring up. In light\nof the bold and defiant line we had taken all along, an appeal would seem anticlimactic and even disillusioning. Our message was that no sacrifice\nwas too great in the struggle for freedom.\nCounsel were unhappy about our decision, and wanted to talk about an appeal. But Walter, Govan, and I wanted to discuss the mechanics of the\nsentencing procedure the next day. If we were sentenced to death, what would then happen? We were told that after de Wet pronounced the death\nsentence, he would ask me, as the first accused, \u201cHave you any reason to advance why the sentence of death should not be passed?\u201d I told Bram,\nJoel, and Vernon that in that case I would have quite a lot to say. I would tell de Wet that I was prepared to die secure in the knowledge that my\ndeath would be an inspiration to the cause for which I was giving my life. My death \u2014 our deaths \u2014 would not be in vain; if anything we might serve\nthe cause greater in death as martyrs than we ever could in life. Counsel said that such a speech would not be very helpful for an appeal, and I\nreaffirmed that we would not be appealing.\nEven if \u2014 especially if \u2014 we did not receive the death penalty, there were practical reasons not to appeal. For one thing, we might lose. An\nappellate court might decide that de Wet had been too lenient and that we deserved the death penalty. An appeal would forestall international\npressure to release us.\nFor the state, a death sentence would be the most practical verdict. We had heard that John Vorster, the minister of justice, had told friends that\nPrime Minister Smuts\u2019s greatest blunder during the Second World War was not hanging him for his treason. The Nationalists, he said, would not\nmake the same mistake.\nI was prepared for the death penalty. To be truly prepared for something, one must actually expect it. One cannot be prepared for something\nwhile secretly believing it will not happen. We were all prepared, not because we were brave but because we were realistic. I thought of the line\nfrom Shakespeare: \u201cBe absolute for death; for either death or life shall be the sweeter.\u201d AFTER THE LIFTING of the Emergency, the National Executive Committee met secretly in September to discuss the future. We had had\ndiscussions in jail during the trial, but this was our first formal session. The state was arming itself not for an external threat but an internal one. We\nwould not disband but carry on from underground. We would have to depart from the democratic procedures, outlined in the ANC\u2019s constitution, of\nholding conferences, branch meetings, and public gatherings. New structures had to be created for communication with unbanned Congress\norganizations. But all of these new structures were illegal and would subject the participants to arrest and imprisonment. The executive committee\nand its subordinate structures would have to be severely streamlined to adapt to illegal conditions. Of necessity, we dissolved the ANC Youth\nLeague and Women\u2019s League. Some fiercely resisted these changes; but the fact was that we were now an illegal organization. For those who\nwould continue to participate, politics went from being a risky occupation to a truly perilous one.\nThough Mandela and Tambo had closed its doors and settled its remaining accounts, I continued to do whatever legal work I could. Numerous\ncolleagues readily made their offices, staff, and phone facilities available to me, but most of the time I preferred to work from Ahmed Kathrada\u2019s\nflat, number  Kholvad House. Although my practice had dissolved, my reputation as a lawyer was undimmed. Soon, the lounge of number  and\nthe hallway outside were crammed with clients. Kathy would return home and discover to his dismay that the only room in which he could be alone\nwas his kitchen.\nDuring this period, I hardly had time for meals and saw very little of my family. I would stay late in Pretoria preparing for our case, or rush back to\nhandle another case. When I could actually sit down to supper with my family, the telephone would ring and I would be called away. Winnie was\npregnant again and infinitely patient. She was hoping her husband might actually be at the hospital when she gave birth. But it was not to be.\nDuring the Christmas adjournment in , I learned that Makgatho was ill in the Transkei where he was at school and I violated my banning\norders and went down to see him. I drove the entire night, stopping only for petrol. Makgatho required surgery, and I decided to bring him back with\nme to Johannesburg. I again drove all night, and took Makgatho to his mother\u2019s place while I went to arrange for his surgery. When I returned, I\nlearned that Winnie had already gone into labor. I rushed to the non-European wing of Bridgman Memorial Hospital to find that mother and daughter\nwere already in residence. The newborn girl was fine, but Winnie was very weak.\nWe named our new daughter Zindziswa, after the daughter of the poet laureate of the Xhosa people, Samuel Mqhayi, who had inspired me so\nmany years before at Healdtown. The poet returned home after a very long trip to find that his wife had given birth to a daughter. He had not known\nthat she was pregnant and assumed that the child had been fathered by another man. In our culture, when a woman gives birth, the husband does\nnot enter the house where she is confined for ten days. In this case, the poet was too enraged to observe this custom, and he stormed into the\nhouse with an assegai, ready to stab both mother and daughter. But when he looked at the baby girl and saw that she was the image of himself, he\nstepped back, and said, \u201cu zindzile,\u201d which means, \u201cYou are well established.\u201d He named her Zindziswa, the feminine version of what he had said. THE CROWN took over a month to do its summing up, which was often interrupted by interjections from the bench pointing out lapses in the\nargument. In March, it was our turn. Issy Maisels categorically refuted the charges of violence. \u201cWe admit that there is a question of noncooperation\nand passive resistance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shall say quite frankly that if noncooperation and passive resistance constitute high treason, then we are\nguilty. But these are plainly not encompassed in the law of treason.\u201d\nMaisels\u2019s argument was continued by Bram Fischer, but on March , the bench cut short Bram\u2019s concluding argument. We still had weeks of\nargument ahead, but the judges asked for a week\u2019s adjournment. This was irregular, but we regarded it as a hopeful sign, for it suggested the\njudges had already formed their opinion. We were to return to court six days later for what we presumed would be the verdict. In the meantime, I had\nwork to do.\nMy bans were due to expire two days after the adjournment. I was almost certain that the police would not be aware of this, as they rarely kept\ntrack of when bans ended. It would be the first time in nearly five years that I would be free to leave Johannesburg, free to attend a meeting. That\nweekend was the long-planned All-in Conference in Pietermaritzburg. Its aim was to agitate for a national constitutional convention for all South\nAfricans. I was secretly scheduled to be the main speaker at the conference. I would make the three-hundred-mile drive down to Pietermaritzburg\nthe night before I was scheduled to speak.\nThe day before I was to leave, the National Working Committee met secretly to discuss strategy. After many meetings in prison and outside, we\nhad decided that we would work from underground, adopting a strategy along the lines of the M-Plan. The organization would survive clandestinely.\nIt was decided that if we were not convicted I would go underground to travel about the country organizing the proposed national convention. Only\nsomeone operating full-time from underground would be free from the paralyzing restrictions imposed by the enemy. It was decided that I would\nsurface at certain events, hoping for a maximum of publicity, to show that the ANC was still fighting. It was not a proposal that came as a surprise to\nme, not was it one I particularly relished, but it was something I knew I had to do. This would be a hazardous life, and I would be apart from my\nfamily, but when a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, he has no choice but to become an outlaw.\nWhen I returned home from the meeting it was as if Winnie could read my thoughts. Seeing my face, she knew that I was about to embark on a\nlife that neither of us wanted. I explained what had transpired and that I would be leaving the next day. She took this stoically, as if she had expected\nit all along. She understood what I had to do, but that did not make it any easier for her. I asked her to pack a small suitcase for me. I told her that\nfriends and relatives would look after her while I was gone. I did not tell her how long I would be gone and she did not ask. It was just as well,\nbecause I did not know the answer. I would return to Pretoria for what would probably be the verdict on Monday. No matter the result, I would not be\nreturning home: if we were convicted, I would go directly to prison; if we were discharged, I would immediately go underground.\nMy elder son, Thembi, was in school in the Transkei, so I could not say good-bye to him, but that afternoon I fetched Makgatho and my daughter\nMakaziwe from their mother in Orlando East. We spent some hours together, walking on the veld outside town, talking and playing. I said good-bye\nto them, not knowing when I would see them again. The children of a freedom fighter also learn not to ask their father too many questions, and I\ncould see in their eyes that they understood that something serious was occurring.\nAt home, I kissed the two girls good-bye and they waved as I got in the car with Wilson Conco and began the long drive to Natal.\n\nFourteen hundred delegates from all over the country representing one hundred fifty different religious, social, cultural, and political bodies\nconverged on Pietermaritzburg for the All-in Conference. When I walked out onstage on Saturday evening, March , in front of this loyal and\nenthusiastic audience, it had been nearly five years since I had been free to give a speech on a public platform. I was met with a joyous reaction. I\nhad almost forgotten the intensity of the experience of addressing a crowd.\nIn my speech I called for a national convention in which all South Africans, black and white, Indian and Coloured, would sit down in brotherhood\nand create a constitution that mirrored the aspirations of the country as a whole. I called for unity, and said we would be invincible if we spoke with\none voice.\nThe All-in Conference called for a national convention of elected representatives of all adult men and women on an equal basis to determine a\nnew nonracial democratic constitution for South Africa. A National Action Council was elected, with myself as honorary secretary, to communicate\nthis demand to the government. If the government failed to call such a convention, we would call a countrywide three-day stay-away beginning on\nMay  to coincide with the declaration of South Africa as a republic. I had no illusions that the state would agree to our proposal.\nIn October , the government had held an all-white referendum on whether South Africa should become a republic. This was one of the longcherished dreams of Afrikaner nationalism, to cast off ties to the country they had fought against in the Anglo-Boer War. The pro-republic sentiment\nwon with  percent of the vote, and the proclamation of the republic was set for May , . We set our stay-at-home on the date of the\nproclamation to indicate that such a change for us was merely cosmetic.\nDirectly after the conference I sent Prime Minister Verwoerd a letter in which I formally enjoined him to call a national constitutional convention. I\nwarned him that if he failed to call the convention we would stage the country\u2019s most massive three-day strike ever, beginning on May . \u201cWe have\nno illusions about the counter-measures your government might take,\u201d I wrote. \u201cDuring the last twelve months we have gone through a period of grim\ndictatorship.\u201d I also issued press statements affirming that the strike was a peaceful and nonviolent stay-at-home. Verwoerd did not reply, except to\ndescribe my letter in Parliament as \u201carrogant.\u201d The government instead began to mount one of the most intimidating displays of force ever\nassembled in the country\u2019s history. ALTHOUGH FEW PEOPLE will remember June , , it was a landmark in South African history. On that day, after months of negotiations at the\nWorld Trade Centre, the multiparty forum voted to set a date for the country\u2019s first national, nonracial, one-person-one-vote election: April , .\nFor the first time in South African history, the black majority would go to the polls to elect their own leaders. The agreement was that voters would\nelect four hundred representatives to a constituent assembly, which would both write a new constitution and serve as a parliament. After convening,\nthe first order of business for the assembly would be to elect a president.\nThe talks had reconvened in April. This time, the twenty-six parties included Inkatha, the Pan Africanist Congress, and the Conservative Party.\nWe had been pressing the government to establish a date for months, and they had been stalling. But now the date was written in stone.\nA month later, in July, the multiparty forum agreed on a first draft of an interim constitution. It provided for a bicameral parliament with a fourhundred-member national assembly elected by proportional representation from national and regional party lists and a senate elected indirectly by\nregional legislatures. Elections to regional legislatures would take place at the same time as national elections, and the regional bodies could draw\nup their own constitutions consistent with the national constitution.\nChief Buthelezi wanted a constitution drawn up before the election and walked out in protest against the setting of an election date before a\nconstitution was finalized. A second draft interim constitution in August gave greater powers to the regions, but this did not placate either Chief\nButhelezi or the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party described the resolutions as hostile to Afrikaner interests. A group called the Afrikaner\nVolksfront, led by General Constand Viljoen, a former chief of the South African Defense Force, was formed to unite conservative white\norganizations around the idea of a volkstaat, a white homeland.\nJust after midnight on November , an interim constitution was approved by a plenary session of the multiparty conference. The government and\nthe ANC had cleared the remaining hurdles. The new cabinet would be composed of those winning more than  percent of the vote and would\nmake decisions by consensus, rather than the two-thirds majority proposed by the government; national elections would not take place until ,\nso that the government of national unity would serve for five years; and finally, the government gave way on our insistence on a single ballot paper\nfor the election, rather than separate ballots for national and provincial legislatures. Two ballot papers would only confuse a majority of voters, most\nof whom would be voting for the first time in their lives. In the period leading up to the election, a Transitional Executive Council with members from\neach party would ensure the right climate for the elections. In effect, the TEC would be the government between December  and the election on\nApril . An Independent Electoral Commission with extensive powers would be responsible for the administration of the election. We were truly on\nthe threshold of a new era.\n\nI have never cared very much for personal prizes. A man does not become a freedom fighter in the hope of winning awards, but when I was notified\nthat I had won the  Nobel Peace Prize jointly with Mr. de Klerk, I was deeply moved. The Nobel Peace Prize had a special meaning to me\nbecause of its involvement with South African history.\nI was the third South African since the end of the Second World War to be so honored by the Nobel committee. Chief Albert Luthuli was awarded\nthe prize in . The second was Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who selflessly fought the evils of racism during the most terrible days of apartheid.\nThe award was a tribute to all South Africans and especially to those who had fought in the struggle; I would accept the award on their behalf. But\nthe Nobel award was one I never thought about. Even during the bleakest years on Robben Island, Amnesty International would not campaign for us\non the grounds that we had pursued an armed struggle, and their organization would not represent anyone who had embraced violence. It was for\nthat reason that I assumed the Nobel committee would never consider the man who had started Umkhonto we Sizwe for the peace prize.\nI had tremendous respect for the nations of Norway and Sweden. In the s and s, when we went to Western governments seeking\ncontributions to the ANC, we were turned down flat. But in Norway and Sweden, we were greeted with open arms, and given assistance and\nscholarships and money for legal defense and humanitarian aid for political prisoners.\nI used my speech in Norway nor only to thank the Nobel committee and sketch out a vision of a future South Africa that was just and equitable, but\nto pay tribute to my fellow laureate, Mr. F. W. de Klerk.\nHe had the courage to admit that a terrible wrong had been done to our country and people through the imposition of the system of apartheid. He had the foresight to understand\nand accept that all the people of South Africa must, through negotiations and as equal participants in the process, together determine what they want to make of their future.\n\nI was often asked how could I accept the award jointly with Mr. de Klerk after I had criticized him so severely. Although I would not take back my\ncriticisms, I could say that he had made a genuine and indispensable contribution to the peace process. I never sought to undermine Mr. de Klerk,\nfor the practical reason that the weaker he was, the weaker the negotiations process. To make peace with an enemy one must work with that\nenemy, and that enemy becomes one\u2019s partner.\n\nAlthough the official campaign for the national assembly was not scheduled to begin until February , we started to campaign in earnest after\nthe new constitution was ratified. That did not give us a head start; the National Party began its campaign the day they released me from prison.\nAlthough the polls showed the ANC with a healthy margin, we never took victory for granted. I counseled everyone against overoptimism. We had\nall read dozens of accounts of parties favored to win who came in second. We faced an experienced, well-organized, and well-financed rival.\nOur campaign was under the capable leadership of Popo Molefe, Terror Lekota, and Ketso Gordhan, all veteran UDF activists adept at mass\nmobilization. The task was a formidable one. We estimated that there would be over twenty million people going to the polls, most of them voting for\nthe first time. Many of our voters were illiterate, and were likely to be intimidated by the mere idea of voting. According to the Independent Electoral\nCommission, there would be ten thousand polling stations around the country. We sought to train over one hundred thousand people to assist with\nvoter education.\nThe first stage of our election effort was what was known as People\u2019s Forums. ANC candidates would travel all over the country and hold\nmeetings in towns and villages in order to listen to the hopes and fears, the ideas and complaints, of our people. The People\u2019s Forums were similar\nto the town meetings that candidate Bill Clinton held in America on his way to the presidency. The forums were parliaments of the people, not unlike\nthe meetings of chiefs at the Great Place that I witnessed as a boy.\nI reveled in the People\u2019s Forums. I began in Natal in November, and then went to the PWV area, the northern Transvaal, and the Orange Free\nState. I attended as many as three or four forums in a day. The people themselves enjoyed them immensely. No one had ever come to solicit their\n\n\fopinion on what should be done in their own country.\nAfter incorporating the suggestions from the forums, we traveled the country delivering our message to the people. Some in the ANC wanted to\nmake the campaign simply a liberation election, and tell the people: Vote for us because we set you free. We decided instead to offer them a vision\nof the South Africa we hoped to create. We wanted people to vote for the ANC not just because we had fought apartheid for eighty years, but\nbecause we were best qualified to bring about the kind of South Africa they hoped to live in. I felt that our campaign should be about the future, not\nthe past.\nThe ANC drafted a -page document known as the Reconstruction and Development Program, which outlined our plan to create jobs through\npublic works; to build a million new houses with electricity and flush toilets; to extend primary health care and ten years of free education to all South\nAfricans; to redistribute land through a land claims court; and to end the value-added tax on basic foodstuffs. We were also committed to extensive\naffirmative action measures in both the private and public sectors. This document was translated into a simpler manifesto called \u201cA Better Life for\nAll,\u201d which in turn became the ANC\u2019s campaign slogan.\nJust as we told the people what we would do, I felt we must also tell them what we could not do. Many people felt life would change overnight after\na free and democratic election, but that would be far from the case. Often, I said to crowds, \u201cDo not expect to be driving a Mercedes the day after\nthe election or swimming in your own backyard pool.\u201d I told our supporters, \u201cLife will not change dramatically, except that you will have increased\nyour self-esteem and become a citizen in your own land. You must have patience. You might have to wait five years for results to show.\u201d I challenged\nthem; I did not patronize them: \u201cIf you want to continue living in poverty without clothes and food,\u201d I told them, \u201cthen go and drink in the shebeens. But\nif you want better things, you must work hard. We cannot do it all for you; you must do it yourselves.\u201d\nI told white audiences that we needed them and did not want them to leave the country. They were South Africans just like ourselves and this was\ntheir land, too. I would not mince words about the horrors of apartheid, but I said, over and over, that we should forget the past and concentrate on\nbuilding a better future for all.\nEach rally was also designed to teach people how to vote. The ballot itself was a long, narrow piece of paper with the parties listed in\ndescending order to the left, and then the symbol of the party and a picture of its leader to the right. Voters were to place an X in the box next to the\nparty of their choice. I would tell audiences, \u201cOn election day, look down your ballot and when you see the face of a young and handsome man, mark\nan X.\u201d\n WHEN WINNIE VISITED, I had the illusion, however briefly, that the family was still intact. Her visits were becoming less frequent, as the police were\nbecoming more vigilant. Winnie would bring Zindzi and Zenani to Rivonia, but they were too young to know that I was in hiding. Makgatho, then\neleven, was old enough to know and he had been instructed never to reveal my real name in front of anyone. I could tell that he was determined, in\nhis own small way, to keep my identity a secret.\nBut one day, toward the end of that year, he was at the farm playing with Nicholas Goldreich, Arthur\u2019s eleven-year-old son. Winnie had brought\nme a copy of the magazine Drum, and Makgatho and Nicholas stumbled upon it while they were playing. They began paging through it when\nsuddenly Makgatho stopped at a picture of me taken before I had gone underground. \u201cThat\u2019s my father,\u201d he exclaimed. Nicholas did not believe\nhim, and his skepticism made Makgatho even keener to prove it was true. Makgatho then told his friend that my real name was Nelson Mandela.\n\u201cNo, your father\u2019s name is David,\u201d Nicholas replied. The boy then ran to his mother and asked her whether or not my name was David. She replied\nthat yes, it was David. Nicholas then explained to his mother that Makgatho had told him that his father\u2019s real name was Nelson. This alarmed Hazel\nand I soon learned of this lapse. Once again I had the feeling that I had remained too long in one place. But I stayed put, for in a little over a week I\nwas to leave on a mission that would take me to places that I had only ever dreamed of. Now, the struggle would for the first time take me outside\nthe borders of my country.\n\nIn December, the ANC received an invitation from the Pan African Freedom Movement for East, Central, and Southern Africa (PAFMECSA) to\nattend its conference in Addis Ababa in February . PAFMECSA, which later became the Organization of African Unity, aimed to draw\ntogether the independent states of Africa and promote the liberation movements on the continent. The conference would furnish important\nconnections for the ANC and be the first and best chance for us to enlist support, money, and training for MK.\nThe underground executive asked me to lead the ANC delegation to the conference. Although I was eager to see the rest of Africa and meet\nfreedom fighters from my own continent, I was greatly concerned that I would be violating the promise I had made not to leave the country but to\noperate from underground. My colleagues, including Chief Luthuli, insisted that I go, but were adamant that I return immediately afterward. I decided\nto make the trip.\nMy mission in Africa was broader than simply attending the conference; I was to arrange political and economic support for our new military force\nand, more important, military training for our men in as many places on the continent as possible. I was also determined to boost our reputation in\nthe rest of Africa where we were still relatively unknown. The PAC had launched its own propaganda campaign and I was delegated to make our\ncase wherever possible.\nBefore leaving, I secretly drove to Groutville to confer with the chief. Our meeting \u2014 at a safe house in town \u2014 was disconcerting. As I have\nrelated, the chief was present at the creation of MK, and was as informed as any member of the National Executive Committee about its\ndevelopment. But the chief was not well and his memory was not what it had once been. He chastised me for not consulting with him about the\nformation of MK. I attempted to remind the chief of the discussions that we had in Durban about taking up violence, but he did not recall them. This\nis in large part why the story has gained currency that Chief Luthuli was not informed about the creation of MK and was deeply opposed to the ANC\ntaking up violence. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nI had spent the night before my departure with Winnie at the house of white friends in the northern suburbs and she brought me a new suitcase that\nshe had packed. She was anxious about my leaving the country, but once again remained stoic. She behaved as much like a soldier as a wife.\nThe ANC had to arrange for me to travel to Dar es Salaam in Tanganyika. The flight to Addis Ababa would originate in Dar es Salaam. The plan\nwas for Walter, Kathrada, and Duma Nokwe to meet me at a secret rendezvous in Soweto and bring me my credentials for the trip. It would also be\na moment for last-minute consultations before I left the country.\nAhmed Kathrada arrived at the appointed hour, but Walter and Duma were extremely late. I finally had to make alternative arrangements and\nKathy managed to locate someone to drive me to Bechuanaland, where I would charter a plane. I later learned that Walter and Duma had been\narrested on their way.\nThe drive to Bechuanaland was trying, as I was nervous both about the police and the fact that I had never crossed the boundaries of my country\nbefore. Our destination was Lobatse, near the South African border. We passed through the border without a problem and arrived in Lobatse in the\nlate afternoon, where there was a telegram for me from Dar es Salaam postponing my trip for a fortnight. I put up with my fellow Treason Trialist\nFish Keitsing, who had since moved to Lobatse.\nThat afternoon I met with Professor K. T. Motsete, the president of the Bechuanaland People\u2019s Party, which had been formed mainly by ex-ANC\nmembers. I now had unexpected spare time, which I used for reading, preparing my speech for the conference, and hiking the wild and beautiful\nhills above the town. Although I was not far outside my own country\u2019s borders, I felt as though I were in an exotic land. I was often accompanied by\nMax Mlonyeni, the son of a friend from the Transkei and a young member of the PAC. It was as though we were on safari, for we encountered all\nmanner of animals, including a battalion of sprightly baboons, which I followed for some time, admiring their military-like organization and\nmovements.\nI was soon joined by Joe Matthews, who had come from Basutoland, and I insisted we should make haste for Dar es Salaam. An ANC colleague\nin Lobatse had recently been kidnapped by the South African police and I thought the sooner we could leave, the better. A plane was arranged, and\nour first destination was a town in northern Bechuanaland called Kasane, strategically situated near a point where the borders of four countries met\n\u2014 Bechuanaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, and South West Africa, as these colonies were then known. The landing strip at Kasane was\nwater-logged and we came in at a drier strip several miles away in the middle of the bush. The manager of a local hotel came to fetch us armed\nwith rifles and reported that he had been delayed by a herd of rogue elephants. He was in an open van and Joe and I sat in the back, and I watched\na lioness lazily emerge from the bush. I felt far from my home streets of Johannesburg; I was in the Africa of myth and legend for the first time.\nEarly the next morning we left for Mbeya, a Tanganyikan town near the Northern Rhodesian border. We flew near Victoria Falls and then headed\nnorth through a mountain range. While over the mountains, the pilot tried to contact Mbeya, but there was no answer. \u201cMbeya, Mbeya!\u201d he kept\nsaying into the microphone. The weather had changed and the mountains were full of air pockets that made the plane bounce up and down like a\ncork on a rough sea. We were now flying through clouds and mists and in desperation the pilot descended and followed a twisting road through the\nmountains. By this time the mist had become so thick we could not see the road and when the pilot abruptly turned the plane I realized that we\n\n\fnarrowly missed a mountain that seemed to rear up out of nowhere. The emergency alarm went off, and I remember saying to myself, \u201cThat\u2019s the\nend of us.\u201d Even the ever-loquacious Joe was stone silent. But then just as we could see no farther in the clouds and I imagined we were about to\ncrash into a mountain, we emerged from the bad weather into a gloriously clear sky. I have never enjoyed flying much, and while this was the most\nfrightening episode I have ever had on a plane, I am sometimes adept at appearing brave and I pretended that I was unconcerned.\nWe booked in a local hotel and found a crowd of blacks and whites sitting on the veranda making polite conversation. Never before had I been in\na public place or hotel where there was no color bar. We were waiting for Mr. Mwakangale of the Tanganyika African National Union, a member of\nParliament, and unbeknown to us he had already called looking for us. An African guest approached the white receptionist. \u201cMadam, did a Mr.\nMwakangale inquire after these two gentlemen?\u201d he asked, pointing to us. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe did but I forgot to tell them.\u201d\n\u201cPlease be careful, madam,\u201d he said in a polite but firm tone. \u201cThese men are our guests and we would like them to receive proper attention.\u201d I\nthen truly realized that I was in a country ruled by Africans. For the first time in my life, I was a free man. Though I was a fugitive and wanted in my\nown land, I felt the burden of oppression lifting from my shoulders. Everywhere I went in Tanganyika my skin color was automatically accepted rather\nthan instantly reviled. I was being judged for the first time not by the color of my skin but by the measure of my mind and character. Although I was\noften homesick during my travels, I nevertheless felt as though I were truly home for the first time.\nWe arrived in Dar es Salaam the next day and I met with Julius Nyerere, the newly independent country\u2019s first president. We talked at his house,\nwhich was not at all grand, and I recall that he drove himself in a simple car, a little Austin. This impressed me, for it suggested that he was a man of\nthe people. Class, Nyerere always insisted, was alien to Africa; socialism indigenous.\nI reviewed our situation for him, ending with an appeal for help. He was a shrewd, soft-spoken man who was well-disposed to our mission, but his\nperception of the situation surprised and dismayed me. He suggested we postpone the armed struggle until Sobukwe came out of prison. This was\nthe first of many occasions when I learned of the PAC\u2019s appeal in the rest of Africa. I described the weakness of the PAC, and argued that a\npostponement would be a setback for the struggle as a whole. He suggested I seek the favor of Emperor Haile Selassie and promised to arrange\nan introduction.\nI was meant to meet Oliver in Dar, but because of my delay he was unable to wait and left a message for me to follow him to Lagos, where he\nwas to attend the Lagos Conference of Independent States. On the flight to Accra I ran into Hymie Basner and his wife. Basner, who had once been\nmy employer, had been offered a position in Accra. His radical politics and left-wing activities in South Africa had made him persona non grata\nthere and he was seeking political asylum in Ghana.\nThe plane stopped in Khartoum and we lined up to go through customs. Joe Matthews was first, then myself, followed by Basner and his wife.\nBecause I did not have a passport, I carried with me a rudimentary document from Tanganyika that merely said, \u201cThis is Nelson Mandela, a citizen\nof the Republic of South Africa. He has permission to leave Tanganyika and return here.\u201d I handed this paper to the old Sudanese man behind the\nimmigration counter and he looked up with a smile and said, \u201cMy son, welcome to the Sudan.\u201d He then shook my hand and stamped my document.\nBasner was behind me and handed the old man the same type of document. The old man looked at it for a moment, and then said in a rather\nagitated manner: \u201cWhat is this? What is this piece of paper? It is not official!\u201d\nBasner calmly explained it was a document he had been given in Tanganyika because he did not have a passport. \u201cNot have a passport?\u201d the\nimmigration official said with disdain. \u201cHow can you not have a passport \u2014 you are a white man!\u201d Basner replied that he was persecuted in his own\ncountry because he fought for the rights of blacks. The Sudanese looked skeptical: \u201cBut you are a white man!\u201d Joe looked at me and knew what I\nwas thinking: he whispered to me not to intervene, as we were guests in the Sudan and did not want to offend our host\u2019s hospitality. But apart from\nbeing my employer, Basner was one of those whites who had truly taken risks on the behalf of black emancipation, and I could not desert him.\nInstead of leaving with Joe, I remained and stood close to the official and every time Basner said something, I simply bowed and nodded to the\nofficial as if to verify what he was saying. The old man realized what I was doing, softened his manner, and finally stamped his document and said\nquietly, \u201cWelcome to the Sudan.\u201d\n\nI had not seen Oliver in nearly two years, and when he met me at the airport in Accra I barely recognized him. Once clean shaven and conservatively\ngroomed, he now had a beard and longish hair and affected the military-style clothing characteristic of freedom fighters around the continent. (He\nprobably had exactly the same reaction to me.) It was a happy reunion, and I complimented him on the tremendous work he had done abroad. He\nhad already established ANC offices in Ghana, England, Egypt, and Tanganyika, and had made valuable contacts for us in many other countries.\nEverywhere I subsequently traveled, I discovered the positive impression Oliver had made on diplomats and statesmen. He was the best possible\nambassador for the organization.\nThe goal of the Lagos Conference of Independent States was to unite all African states, but it eventually disintegrated into bickering about which\nstates to include or exclude. I kept a low profile and avoided the conference, for we did not want the South African government to know that I was\nabroad until I appeared at the PAFMECSA conference in Addis.\n\nOn the plane from Accra to Addis, we found Gaur Radebe, Peter Molotsi, and other members of the PAC who were also on their way to\nPAFMECSA. They were all surprised to see me, and we immediately plunged into discussions concerning South Africa. The atmosphere was\nenjoyable and relaxed. Though I had been dismayed to learn of Gaur\u2019s leaving the ANC, that did not diminish my pleasure in seeing him. High\nabove the ground and far from home, we had much more that united us than separated us.\nWe put down briefly in Khartoum, where we changed to an Ethiopian Airways flight to Addis. Here I experienced a rather strange sensation. As I\nwas boarding the plane I saw that the pilot was black. I had never seen a black pilot before, and the instant I did I had to quell my panic. How could a\nblack man fly an airplane? But a moment later I caught myself: I had fallen into the apartheid mind-set, thinking Africans were inferior and that flying\nwas a white man\u2019s job. I sat back in my seat, and chided myself for such thoughts. Once we were in the air, I lost my nervousness and studied the\ngeography of Ethiopia, thinking how guerrilla forces hid in these very forests to fight the Italian imperialists. AFTER CROSSING THE BORDER, I breathed in deeply. The air of one\u2019s home always smells sweet after one has been away. It was a clear winter\nnight and somehow even the stars looked more welcoming here than from elsewhere on the continent. Though I was leaving a world where I\nexperienced freedom for the first time and returning to one where I was a fugitive, I was profoundly relieved to be back in the land of my birth and\ndestiny.\nBetween Bechuanaland and the northwestern Transvaal, dozens of unmarked roads traverse the border, and Cecil knew just which ones to take.\nDuring the drive, he filled me in on many of the events I had missed. We drove all night, slipping across the border just after midnight and reaching\nLiliesleaf Farm at dawn. I was still wearing my beat-up khaki training uniform.\nOnce at the farm, I did not have time for rest and reflection because the following night we held a secret meeting for me to brief the Working\nCommittee on my trip. Walter, Moses Kotane, Govan Mbeki, Dan Tloome, J. B. Marks, and Duma Nokwe all arrived at the farm, a rare reunion. I\nfirst gave a general overview of my travels, itemizing the money we had received and the offers of training. At the same time, I reported in detail the\nreservations I had encountered about the ANC\u2019s cooperation with whites, Indians, particularly Communists. Still ringing in my ears was my final\nmeeting with the Zambian leaders who told me that while they knew the ANC was stronger and more popular than the PAC, they understood the\nPAC\u2019s pure African nationalism but were bewildered by the ANC\u2019s nonracialism and Communist ties. I informed them that Oliver and I believed the\nANC had to appear more independent to reassure our new allies on the continent, for they were the ones who would be financing and training\nUmkhonto we Sizwe. I proposed reshaping the Congress Alliance so that the ANC would clearly be seen as the leader, especially on issues\ndirectly affecting Africans.\nThis was a serious proposition, and the entire leadership had to be consulted. The Working Committee urged me to go down to Durban and\nbrief the chief. All agreed except Govan Mbeki, who was not then living at Liliesleaf Farm but was present as part of the High Command of MK. He\nurged me to send someone else. It was simply too risky, he said, and the organization should not jeopardize my safety, especially as I was newly\nreturned and ready to push ahead with MK. This wise advice was overruled by everyone, including myself.\n\nI left the next night from Rivonia in the company of Cecil, again posing as his chauffeur. I had planned a series of secret meetings in Durban, the first\nof which was with Monty Naicker and Ismail Meer to brief them about my trip and to discuss the new proposal. Monty and Ismail were extremely\nclose to the chief, and the chief trusted their views. I wanted to be able to tell Luthuli I had spoken to his friends and convey their reaction. Ismail and\nMonty, however, were disturbed by my belief that the ANC needed to take the lead among the Congress Alliance and make statements on its own\nconcerning affairs that affected Africans. They were against anything that unraveled the alliance.\nI was taken to Groutville, where the chief lived, and we met in the house of an Indian lady in town. I explained the situation to the chief at some\nlength, and he listened without speaking. When I was done, he said he did not like the idea of foreign politicians dictating policy to the ANC. He\nsaid we had evolved the policy of nonracialism for good reasons and he did not think that we should alter our policy because it did not suit a few\nforeign leaders.\nI told the chief that these foreign politicians were not dictating our policy, but merely saying that they did not understand it. My plan, I told him, was\nsimply to effect essentially cosmetic changes in order to make the ANC more intelligible \u2014 and more palatable \u2014 to our allies. I saw this as a\ndefensive maneuver, for if African states decided to support the PAC, a small and weak organization could suddenly become a large and potent\none.\nThe chief did not make decisions on the spur of the moment. I could see he wanted to think about what I had said and talk to some of his friends\nabout it. I said farewell, and he advised me to be careful. I still had a number of clandestine meetings in the city and townships that evening. My last\nmeeting that evening was with the MK Regional Command in Durban.\nThe Durban Command was led by a sabotage expert named Bruno Mtolo, whom I had never met before, but would meet again under\ndramatically different circumstances. I briefed them on my trip to Africa, about the support we had received and the offers of training. I explained\nthat for the moment MK was limited to sabotage, but that if sabotage did not have the desired effect we would probably move on to guerrilla\nwarfare.\nLater that same evening, at the home of the photojournalist G. R. Naidoo, where I was staying, I was joined by Ismail and Fatima Meer, Monty\nNaicker, and J. N. Singh for what was a combination welcome-home party and going-away party, for I was leaving the next day for Johannesburg. It\nwas a pleasant evening and my first night of relaxation in a long while. I slept well and I met Cecil on Sunday afternoon \u2014 the fifth of August \u2014 for\nthe long drive back to Johannesburg in his trusty Austin.\nI wore my chauffeur\u2019s white dust-coat and sat next to Cecil as he drove. We often took turns spelling each other behind the wheel. It was a clear,\ncool day and I reveled in the beauty of the Natal countryside; even in winter, Natal remains green. Now that I was returning to Johannesburg I would\nhave some time to see Winnie and the children. I had often wished that Winnie could share with me the wonders of Africa, but the best I could do\nwas to tell her what I had seen and done.\nOnce we left the industrial precincts of Durban, we moved through hills that offered majestic views of the surrounding valleys and the blue-black\nwaters of the Indian Ocean. Durban is the principal port for the country\u2019s main industrial area, and the highway that leads to Johannesburg runs\nparallel to the railway line for a great distance. I went from contemplating the natural beauty to ruminating on the fact that the railway line, being so\nclose to the highway, offered a convenient place for sabotage. I made a note of this in the small notebook I always carried with me.\nCecil and I were engrossed in discussions of sabotage plans as we passed through Howick, twenty miles northwest of Pietermaritzburg. At\nCedara, a small town just past Howick, I noticed a Ford V- filled with white men shoot past us on the right. I instinctively turned round to look behind\nand I saw two more cars filled with white men. Suddenly, in front of us, the Ford was signaling us to stop. I knew in that instant that my life on the run\nwas over; my seventeen months of \u201cfreedom\u201d were about to end.\nAs Cecil slowed down he turned to me and said, \u201cWho are these men?\u201d I did not answer because we both knew full well who they were. They had\nchosen their hiding-spot well; to the left of us was a steep wooded bank they could have forced us into had we tried to elude them. I was in the lefthand passenger seat, and for a moment I thought about jumping out and making an escape into the woods, but I would have been shot in a matter\nof seconds.\nWhen our car stopped, a tall slender man with a stern expression on his face came directly over to the window on the passenger side. He was\nunshaven and it appeared that he had not slept in quite a while. I immediately assumed he had been waiting for us for several days. In a calm voice,\nhe introduced himself as Sergeant Vorster of the Pietermaritzburg police and produced an arrest warrant. He asked me to identify myself. I told him\nmy name was David Motsamayi. He nodded, and then, in a very proper way, he asked me a few questions about where I had been and where I was\n\n\fgoing. I parried these questions without giving him much information. He seemed a bit irritated and then, he said, \u201cAg, you\u2019re Nelson Mandela, and\nthis is Cecil Williams, and you are under arrest!\u201d\nHe informed us that a police major from the other car would accompany us back to Pietermaritzburg. The police were not yet so vigilant in those\ndays, and Sergeant Vorster did not bother searching me. I had my loaded revolver with me, and again, I thought of escape, but I would have been\ngreatly outnumbered. I secretly put the revolver \u2014 and my notebook \u2014 in the upholstery between my seat and Cecil\u2019s. For some reason, the police\nnever found the gun or the small notebook, which was fortunate, for many more people would have been arrested if they had.\nAt the police station I was led into Sergeant Vorster\u2019s office, where I saw a number of officers, one of whom was Warrant Officer Truter, who had\ntestified in the Treason Trial. Truter had made a favorable impression on the accused because he had accurately explained the policy of the ANC,\nand had not exaggerated or lied. We greeted each other in a friendly way.\nI had still not admitted to anything other than the name David Motsamayi, and Truter said to me, \u201cNelson, why do you keep up this farce? You\nknow I know who you are. We all know who you are.\u201d I told him simply that I had given a name and that is the name I was standing by. I asked for a\nlawyer and was curtly refused. I then declined to make a statement.\nCecil and I were locked in separate cells. I now had time to ruminate on my situation. I had always known that arrest was a possibility, but even\nfreedom fighters practice denial, and in my cell that night I realized I was not prepared for the reality of capture and confinement. I was upset and\nagitated. Someone had tipped off the police about my whereabouts; they had known I was in Durban and that I would be returning to Johannesburg.\nFor weeks before my return the police believed that I was already back in the country. In June, newspaper headlines blared \u201cRETURN OF THE\nBLACK PIMPERNEL\u201d while I was still in Addis Ababa. Perhaps that had been a bluff?\nThe authorities had been harassing Winnie in the belief that she would know whether or not I was back. I knew that they had followed her and\nsearched the house on a number of occasions. I guessed they had figured I would visit Chief Luthuli directly upon my return, and they were correct.\nBut I also suspected they had information that I was in Durban at that time. The movement had been infiltrated with informers, and even wellintentioned people were generally not as tight-lipped as they should have been. I had also been lax. Too many people had known I was in Durban. I\nhad even had a party the night before I left, and I chastised myself for letting down my guard. My mind ricocheted among the possibilities. Was it an\ninformer in Durban? Someone from Johannesburg? Someone from the movement? Or even a friend or member of the family? But such speculation\nabout unknowns is futile, and with the combination of mental and physical exhaustion, I soon fell deeply asleep. At least on this night \u2014 August ,\n \u2014 I did not have to worry about whether the police would find me. They already had.\n\nIn the morning, I felt restored and I braced myself for the new ordeal that lay ahead of me. I would not, under any circumstances, seem despairing or\neven disappointed to my captors. At : I appeared before the local magistrate and was formally remanded to Johannesburg. It was low-key, and\nthe magistrate seemed no more concerned than if he were handling a traffic summons. The police had not taken elaborate precautions for the trip\nback to Johannesburg or for my security, and I merely sat in the backseat of a sedan, unhandcuffed, with two officers riding in front. My arrest had\nbeen discovered by my friends; Fatima Meer brought some food to the jail for me and I shared it with the two officers in the car. We even stopped\nat Volksrust, a town along the way, and they allowed me to take a brief walk to stretch my legs. I did not contemplate escape when people were\nkind to me; I did not want to take advantage of the trust they placed in me.\nBut as we approached Johannesburg, the atmosphere changed. I heard an announcement over the police radio of my capture and the order to\nfold up the roadblocks to and from Natal. At sunset, on the outskirts of Johannesburg, we were met by a sizable police escort. I was abruptly\nhandcuffed, taken from the car, and placed in a sealed police van with small opaque windows reinforced with wire netting. The motorcade then took\na circuitous and unfamiliar route to Marshall Square as if they were concerned we might be ambushed.\nI was locked in a cell by myself. In the quiet of the cell I was planning my strategy for the next day, when I heard a cough from a nearby cell. I did\nnot realize a prisoner was close by, but more than that, there was something about this cough, something that struck me as curiously familiar. I sat\nup in sudden recognition and called out, \u201cWalter?\u201d\n\u201cNelson, is that you?\u201d he said, and we laughed with an indescribable mixture of relief, surprise, disappointment, and happiness. Walter, I learned,\nhad been arrested shortly after my own arrest. We did not think that the arrests were unrelated. While this was not the most auspicious place for a\nmeeting of the National Working Committee, it was certainly convenient and the night sped by as I gave him a full account of my arrest, as well as\nmy meetings in Durban.\nThe next day I appeared in court before a senior magistrate for formal remand. Harold Wolpe and Joe Slovo had come to court after hearing of\nmy arrest, and we conferred in the basement. I had appeared before this magistrate on numerous occasions in my professional capacity and we\nhad grown to respect one another. A number of attorneys were also present, some of whom I knew quite well. It is curious how one can be easily\nflattered in certain situations by otherwise insignificant incidents. I am by no means immune to flattery in normal circumstances, but there I was, a\nfugitive, number one on the state\u2019s Most Wanted list, a handcuffed outlaw who had been underground for more than a year, and yet the judge, the\nother attorneys, and the spectators all greeted me with deference and professional courtesy. They knew me as Nelson Mandela attorney-at-law, not\nNelson Mandela outlaw. It lifted my spirits immensely.\nDuring the proceedings, the magistrate was diffident and uneasy, and would not look at me directly. The other attorneys also seemed\nembarrassed, and at that moment, I had something of a revelation. These men were not only uncomfortable because I was a colleague brought low,\nbut because I was an ordinary man being punished for his beliefs. In a way I had never quite comprehended before, I realized the role I could play in\ncourt and the possibilities before me as a defendant. I was the symbol of justice in the court of the oppressor, the representative of the great ideals\nof freedom, fairness, and democracy in a society that dishonored those virtues. I realized then and there that I could carry on the fight even within the\nfortress of the enemy.\nWhen I was asked the name of my counsel, I announced that I would represent myself, with Joe Slovo as legal adviser. By representing myself I\nwould enhance the symbolism of my role. I would use my trial as a showcase for the ANC\u2019s moral opposition to racism. I would not attempt to\ndefend myself so much as put the state itself on trial. That day, I answered only the questions as to my name and choice of counsel. I listened silently\nto the charges: inciting African workers to strike and leaving the country without valid travel documents. In apartheid South Africa, the penalties for\nthese \u201ccrimes\u201d could be as much as ten years in prison. Yet the charges were something of a relief: the state clearly did not have enough evidence\nto link me with Umkhonto we Sizwe or I would have been charged with the far more serious crimes of treason or sabotage.\nOnly as I was leaving the courtroom, did I see Winnie in the spectators\u2019 gallery. She looked distressed and gloomy; she was undoubtedly\nconsidering the difficult months and years ahead, of life on her own, raising two small children, in an often hard and forbidding city. It is one thing to\nbe told of possible hardships ahead, it is entirely another to actually have to confront them. All I could do, as I descended the steps to the basement,\nwas to give her a wide smile, as if to show her that I was not worried and that she should not be either. I cannot imagine that it helped very much.\nFrom the court, I was taken to the Johannesburg Fort. When I emerged from the courthouse to enter the sealed van, there was a crowd of\n\n\fhundreds of people cheering and shouting \u201cAmandla!\u201d followed by \u201cNgawethu,\u201d a popular ANC call-and-response meaning \u201cPower!\u201d and \u201cThe\npower is ours!\u201d People yelled and sang and pounded their fists on the sides of the van as the vehicle crawled out of the courthouse exit. My capture\nand case had made headlines in every paper: \u201cPOLICE SWOOP ENDS TWO YEARS ON THE RUN\u201d was one; \u201cNELSON MANDELA UNDER\nARREST\u201d was another. The so-called Black Pimpernel was no longer at large.\nA few days later Winnie was granted permission to visit me. She had gotten dressed up and now, at least on the face of it, appeared less glum\nthan before. She brought me a new pair of expensive pajamas and a lovely silk gown more appropriate to a salon than a prison. I did not have the\nheart to tell her it was wholly inappropriate for me to wear such things in jail. I knew, however, that the parcel was a way of expressing her love and a\npledge of solidarity. I thanked her, and although we did not have much time we quickly discussed family matters, especially how she would support\nherself and the children. I mentioned the names of friends who would help her and also clients of mine who still owed me money. I told her to tell the\nchildren the truth of my capture, and how I would be away for a long time. I said we were not the first family in this situation, and that those who\nunderwent such hardships came out the stronger. I assured her of the strength of our cause, the loyalty of our friends, and how it would be her love\nand devotion that would see me through whatever transpired. The officer supervising the visit turned a blind eye, and we embraced and clung to\neach other with all the strength and pent-up emotion inside each of us, as if this were to be the final parting. In a way, it was, for we were to be\nseparated for much longer than either of us could then have imagined. The warrant officer allowed me to accompany Winnie part of the way to the\nmain gate where I was able to watch her, alone and proud, disappear around the corner. AT THE FORT I was being supervised by Colonel Minnaar, a courtly Afrikaner considered something of a liberal by his more verkrampte (hard-line)\ncolleagues. He explained that he was placing me in the prison hospital because it was the most comfortable area and I would be able to have a\nchair and table on which I could prepare my case. While the hospital was indeed comfortable \u2014 I was able to sleep in a proper bed, something I\nhad never done before in prison \u2014 the real reason for his generosity was that the hospital was the safest place to keep me. To reach it one had to\npass through two impregnable walls, each with armed guards; and once inside, four massive gates had to be unlocked before one even reached\nthe area where I was kept. There was speculation in the press that the movement was going to attempt to rescue me, and the authorities were\ndoing their utmost to prevent it.\nThere had also been wild speculations, in the press and within the ANC, that I had been betrayed by someone in the movement. I knew that some\npeople blamed G. R. Naidoo, my Durban host, a suggestion I believe was unfounded. The press trumpeted the notion that I had been betrayed by\nwhite and Indian Communists who were unsettled by my suggestions that the ANC must become more Africanist-oriented. But I believed these\nstories were planted by the government to divide the Congress movement, and I regarded it as malicious mischief. I later discussed the matter not\nonly with Walter, Duma, Joe Slovo, and Ahmed Kathrada, but with Winnie, and I was gratified to see that they shared my feelings. Winnie had been\ninvited to open the annual conference of the Transvaal Indian Youth Congress, and at my instigation she repudiated these rumors in no uncertain\nterms. The newspapers were filled with stories of her beauty and eloquence. \u201cWe shall not waste time looking for evidence as to who betrayed\nMandela,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cSuch propaganda is calculated to keep us fighting one another instead of uniting to combat Nationalist\noppression.\u201d\nThe most oft-cited story was that an American consular official with connections to the CIA had tipped off the authorities. This story has never\nbeen confirmed and I have never seen any reliable evidence as to the truth of it. Although the CIA has been responsible for many contemptible\nactivities in its support of American imperialism, I cannot lay my capture at their door. In truth, I had been imprudent about maintaining the secrecy\nof my movements. In retrospect, I realized that the authorities could have had a myriad of ways of locating me on my trip to Durban. It was a wonder\nin fact that I wasn\u2019t captured sooner.\n\nI spent only a few days in the Fort\u2019s hospital before being transferred to Pretoria. There had been no restrictions on visits in Johannesburg, and I\nhad had a continuous stream of people coming to see me. Visitors keep one\u2019s spirits up in prison, and the absence of them can be disheartening.\nIn transferring me to Pretoria, the authorities wanted to get me away from my home turf to a place where I would have fewer friends dropping by.\nI was handcuffed and taken to Pretoria in an old van in the company of another prisoner. The inside of the van was filthy and we sat on a greasy\nspare tire, which slid from side to side as the van rumbled its way to Pretoria. The choice of companion was curious: his name was Nkadimeng and\nhe was a member of one of Soweto\u2019s fiercest gangs. Normally, officials would not permit a political prisoner to share the same vehicle with a\ncommon-law criminal, but I suspect they were hoping I would be intimidated by Nkadimeng, who I assumed was a police informer. I was dirty and\nannoyed by the time I reached prison, and my irritation was aggravated by the fact that I was put in a single cell with this fellow. I demanded and\neventually received separate space so that I could prepare my case.\nI was now permitted visitors only twice a week. Despite the distance, Winnie came regularly and always brought clean clothes and delicious\nfood. This was another way of showing her support, and every time I put on a fresh shirt I felt her love and devotion. I was aware of how difficult it\nmust have been to get to Pretoria in the middle of the day in the middle of the week with two small children at home. I was visited by many others\nwho brought food, including the ever-faithful Mrs. Pillay who supplied me with a spicy lunch every day.\nBecause of the generosity of my visitors I had an embarrassment of riches and wanted to share my food with the other prisoners on my floor. This\nwas strictly forbidden. In order to circumvent the restrictions, I offered food to the warders, who might then relent. With this in mind I presented a\nshiny red apple to an African warder who looked at it and stonily rebuffed me with the phrase \u201cAngiyifuni\u201d (I don\u2019t want it). African warders tend to\nbe either much more sympathetic than white warders, or even more severe, as though to outdo their masters. But, a short while later, the black\nwarder saw a white warder take the apple he had rejected, and changed his mind. Soon I was supplying all my fellow prisoners with food.\nThrough the prison grapevine, I learned that Walter had been brought to Pretoria as well, and although we were isolated from each other we did\nmanage to communicate. Walter had applied for bail \u2014 a decision I fully supported. Bail has long been a sensitive issue within the ANC. There are\nthose who believed we should always reject bail, as it could be interpreted that we were fainthearted rebels who accepted the racist strictures of the\nlegal system. I did not think this view should be universally applied and believed we should examine the issue on a case-by-case basis. Ever since\nWalter had become secretary-general of the ANC, I had felt that every effort should be made to bail him out of prison. He was simply too vital to the\norganization to allow him to languish in jail. In his case, bail was a practical not a theoretical issue. It was different in my own case. I had been\nunderground; Walter had not. I had become a public symbol of rebellion and struggle; Walter operated behind the scenes. He agreed that no\napplication for bail should be made in my case. For one thing, it would not have been granted and I did not want to do anything that might suggest\nthat I was not prepared for the consequences of the underground life I had chosen.\nNot long after Walter and I reached this decision I was again transferred back to the hospital at the Fort. A hearing had been set for October.\nLittle can be said in favor of prison, but enforced isolation is conducive to study. I had begun correspondence studies for my LL.B., a bachelor of\nlaws degree allowing one to practice as an advocate. One of the first things I had done after arriving at Pretoria Local was to send a letter to the\nauthorities notifying them of my intention to study and requesting permission to purchase a copy of the Law of Torts, part of my syllabus.\nA few days later, Colonel Aucamp, commanding officer of Pretoria Local and one of the more notorious of prison officials, marched into my cell\nand in a gloating manner said, \u201cMandela, we have got you now!\u201d Then he said, \u201cWhy do you want a book about torches, man, unless you plan to use\nit for your damn sabotage?\u201d I had no idea what he was talking about, until he produced my letter requesting a book about what he called \u201cthe Law of\nTorches.\u201d I smiled at this and he became angry that I was not taking him seriously. The Afrikaans word for \u201ctorch\u201d is toorts, very similar to tort, and I\nexplained to him that in English tort was a branch of law not a burning stick of wood that could be used to set off a bomb. He went away in a huff.\n\nOne day I was in the prison courtyard at the Fort doing my daily exercises, which consisted of jogging, running in place, push-ups, and sit-ups, when\nI was approached by a tall, handsome Indian fellow named Moosa Dinath whom I had known slightly as a prosperous, even flamboyant\nbusinessman. He was serving a two-year sentence for fraud. On the outside we would have remained acquaintances, but prison is an incubator of\nfriendship. Dinath would often accompany me on my jogs around the courtyard. One day he asked whether I had any objection if he obtained\n\n\fpermission from the commanding officer to be near me in the prison hospital. I told him that I would welcome it, but I thought to myself that the\nauthorities would never permit it. I was wrong.\nIt was exceedingly odd that a convicted prisoner like Dinath was permitted to stay together with a political prisoner awaiting trial. But I said\nnothing, as I was glad to have company. Dinath was wealthy and had a private payroll for the prison authorities. In return for his money, he received\nmany privileges: he wore clothes meant for white prisoners, ate their diet, and did no jail work at all.\nOne night, to my astonishment, I observed Colonel Minnaar, who was the head of prison, and a well-known Afrikaner advocate come to fetch him.\nDinath then left prison for the night and did not come back again until the morning. If I had not seen it with my own eyes I would not have believed it.\nDinath regaled me with tales of financial shenanigans and corruption among cabinet ministers, which I found fascinating. It confirmed to me how\napartheid was a poison that bred moral decay in all areas. I scrupulously avoided discussing with him any matters of a political or sensitive nature\non the grounds that he might also have been an informer. He once asked me to tell him about my African trip and I simply glossed over it. In the end,\nDinath pulled enough strings to speed up his release and left after serving only four months of his two-year sentence.\n\nEscape serves a double purpose: it liberates a freedom fighter from jail so that he can continue to fight, but offers a tremendous psychological\nboost to the struggle and a great publicity blow against the enemy. As a prisoner, I always contemplated escape, and during my various trips to and\nfrom the commanding officer\u2019s office, I carefully surveyed the walls, the movements of the guards, the types of keys and locks used in the doors. I\nmade a detailed sketch of the prison grounds with particular emphasis on the exact location of the prison hospital and the gates leading out of it.\nThis map was smuggled out to the movement with instructions to destroy it immediately after it was perused.\nThere were two plans, one hatched by Moosa Dinath, which I ignored; the second was conceived by the ANC and communicated to me by Joe\nSlovo. It involved bribes, copies of keys, and even a false beard that was to be sewn into the shoulder pad of one of my jackets brought to me in\nprison. The idea was that I would don the beard after I had made my escape. I carefully considered the escape plan and concluded that it was\npremature, and the likelihood of its failure was unacceptably high. Such a failure would be fatal to the organization. During a meeting with Joe, I\npassed him a note communicating my views. I wrote that MK was not ready for such an operation; even an elite and trained force would probably\nnot be able to accomplish such a mission. I suggested that such a gambit be postponed until I was a convicted prisoner and the authorities were\nless cautious. At the end, I wrote, \u201cPlease destroy this after you have finished reading it.\u201d Joe and the others took my advice about not attempting\nthe escape, but he decided the note should be saved as a historical document, and it later turned up at a very unfortunate time.\n AT MIDNIGHT, I was awake and staring at the ceiling \u2014 images from the trial were still rattling around in my head \u2014 when I heard steps coming\ndown the hallway. I was locked in my own cell, away from the others. There was a knock at my door and I could see Colonel Aucamp\u2019s face at the\nbars. \u201cMandela,\u201d he said in a husky whisper, \u201care you awake?\u201d\nI told him I was. \u201cYou are a lucky man,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are taking you to a place where you will have your freedom. You will be able to move around;\nyou\u2019ll see the ocean and the sky, not just gray walls.\u201d\nHe intended no sarcasm, but I well knew that the place he was referring to would not afford me the freedom I longed for. He then remarked rather\ncryptically, \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t make trouble, you\u2019ll get everything you want.\u201d\nAucamp then woke the others, all of whom were in a single cell, ordering them to pack their things. Fifteen minutes later we were making our way\nthrough the iron labyrinth of Pretoria Local, with its endless series of clanging metal doors echoing in our ears.\nOnce outside, the seven of us \u2014 Walter, Raymond, Govan, Kathy, Andrew, Elias, and myself \u2014 were handcuffed and piled into the back of a\npolice van. It was well after midnight, but none of us was tired, and the atmosphere was not at all somber. We sat on the dusty floor, singing and\nchanting, reliving the final moments of the trial. The warders provided us with sandwiches and cold drinks and Lieutenant Van Wyck was perched in\nthe back with us. He was a pleasant fellow, and during a lull in the singing, he offered his unsolicited opinion on our future. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\nchaps won\u2019t be in prison long. The demand for your release is too strong. In a year or two, you will get out and you will return as national heroes.\nCrowds will cheer you, everyone will want to be your friend, women will want you. Ag, you fellows have it made.\u201d We listened without comment, but I\nconfess his speech cheered me considerably. Unfortunately, his prediction turned out to be off by nearly three decades.\n* * *\nWe were departing quietly, secretly, under a heavy police escort, in the middle of the night, and in less than half an hour we found ourselves at a\nsmall military airport outside the city. We were hustled onto a Dakota, a large military transport plane that had seen better days. There was no heat,\nand we shivered in the belly of the plane. Some of the others had never flown before and they seemed more anxious about our voyage than our\ndestination; bumping up and down in a plane at fifteen thousand feet seemed far more perilous than being locked in a cell behind high walls.\nAfter about an hour in the air, dawn lightened the terrain below. The plane had portholes, and as soon as we could see in the half-light, my\ncomrades pressed their faces to the glass. We flew southeast, over the dry, flat plains of the Orange Free State and the green and mountainous\nCape peninsula. I, too, craned to see out the portholes, examining the scenery not as a tourist but as a strategist, looking for areas where a guerrilla\narmy might hide itself.\nThere had been a running argument since the formation of MK as to whether the countryside of South Africa could support a guerrilla army. Most\nof the High Command thought that it could not. When we flew over a wooded, mountainous area called Matroosberg in the Cape, I yelled to my\ncolleagues that here was terrain where we could fight. The men became excited and craned to get a better look, and indeed, the heavily forested\narea appeared as though it could shelter a nascent guerrilla force.\nMinutes later we approached the outskirts of Cape Town. Soon, we could see the little matchbox houses of the Cape Flats, the gleaming towers\nof downtown, and the horizontal top of Table Mountain. Then, out in Table Bay, in the dark blue waters of the Atlantic, we could make out the misty\noutline of Robben Island.\n\nWe landed on an airstrip on one end of the island. It was a grim, overcast day, and when I stepped out of the plane, the cold winter wind whipped\nthrough our thin prison uniforms. We were met by guards with automatic weapons; the atmosphere was tense but quiet, unlike the boisterous\nreception I had received on my arrival on the island two years before.\nWe were driven to the old jail, an isolated stone building, where we were ordered to strip while standing outside. One of the ritual indignities of\nprison life is that when you are transferred from one prison to another, the first thing that happens is that you change from the garb of the old prison\nto that of the new. When we were undressed, we were thrown the plain khaki uniforms of Robben Island.\nApartheid\u2019s regulations extended even to clothing. All of us, except Kathy, received short trousers, an insubstantial jersey, and a canvas jacket.\nKathy, the one Indian among us, was given long trousers. Normally Africans would receive sandals made from car tires, but in this instance we were\ngiven shoes. Kathy, alone, received socks. Short trousers for Africans were meant to remind us that we were \u201cboys.\u201d I put on the short trousers that\nday, but I vowed that I would not put up with them for long.\nThe warders pointed with their guns where they wanted us to go, and barked their orders in simple one-word commands: \u201cMove!\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d\n\u201cHalt!\u201d They did not threaten us in the swaggering way that I recalled from my previous stay, and betrayed no emotion.\nThe old jail was only temporary quarters for us. The authorities were in the process of finishing an entirely separate maximum-security structure\nfor political prisoners. While there, we were not permitted to go outside or have any contact with other prisoners.\n\nThe fourth morning we were handcuffed and taken in a covered truck to a prison within a prison. This new structure was a one-story rectangular\nstone fortress with a flat cement courtyard in the center, about one hundred feet by thirty feet. It had cells on three of the four sides. The fourth side\nwas a twenty-foot-high wall with a catwalk patrolled by guards with German shepherds.\nThe three lines of cells were known as sections A, B, and C, and we were put in Section B, on the easternmost side of the quadrangle. We were\neach given individual cells on either side of a long corridor, with half the cells facing the courtyard. There were about thirty cells in all. The total\nnumber of prisoners in the single cells was usually about twenty-four. Each cell had one window, about a foot square, covered with iron bars. The\ncell had two doors: a metal gate or grille with iron bars on the inside and a thick wooden door outside of that. During the day, only the grille was\nlocked; at night, the wooden door was locked as well.\nThe cells had been constructed hurriedly, and the walls were perpetually damp. When I raised this with the commanding officer, he told me our\nbodies would absorb the moisture. We were each issued three blankets so flimsy and worn they were practically transparent. Our bedding\nconsisted of a single sisal, or straw, mat. Later we were given a felt mat, and one placed the felt mat on top of the sisal one to provide some\nsoftness. At that time of year, the cells were so cold and the blankets provided so little warmth that we always slept fully dressed.\nI was assigned a cell at the head of the corridor. It overlooked the courtyard and had a small eye-level window. I could walk the length of my cell in\nthree paces. When I lay down, I could feel the wall with my feet and my head grazed the concrete at the other side. The width was about six feet, and\n\n\fthe walls were at least two feet thick. Each cell had a white card posted outside of it with our name and our prison service number. Mine read, \u201cN\nMandela /,\u201d which meant I was the th prisoner admitted to the island in . I was forty-six years old, a political prisoner with a life\nsentence, and that small cramped space was to be my home for I knew not how long.\n\nWe were immediately joined by a number of prisoners who had been held in the general section of the prison, a squat brick building not far from\nSection B. The general prison, known as sections F and G, contained about a thousand mostly common-law prisoners. As many as a quarter of\nthem were political prisoners, and a handful of those men were put with us in Section B. We were isolated from the general prisoners for two\nreasons: we were considered risky from a security perspective, but even more dangerous from a political standpoint. The authorities were\nconcerned we might \u201cinfect\u201d the other prisoners with our political views.\nAmong the men put with us was George Peake, one of the founders of the South African Coloured People\u2019s Organization, a Treason Trialist, and\nmost recently a member of the Cape Town City Council. He had been sentenced for planting explosives outside a Cape Town prison. Dennis\nBrutus, another Coloured political activist, was a poet and writer from Port Elizabeth imprisoned for violating his bans. We were also joined by Billy\nNair, a longtime member of the Natal Indian Congress, sentenced for sabotage as a member of Umkhonto we Sizwe.\nWithin a few days we had more company, including Neville Alexander, a prominent Coloured intellectual and member of the Non-European Unity\nMovement, who had formed a tiny radical offshoot called the Yu Chi Chan Club in Cape Town, which studied guerrilla warfare. Neville had a B.A.\nfrom the University of Cape Town and a doctorate in German literature from Tubingen University in Germany. Along with Neville, there was Fikile\nBam, a law student of the University of Cape Town and another member of the Yu Chi Chan Club; and Zephania Mothopeng, a member of the PAC\nNational Executive. Zeph had been a teacher in Orlando, and was a staunch opponent of Bantu Education, and one of the most level-headed of the\nPAC\u2019s leaders. Three aged peasants from the Transkei, sentenced for plotting to assassinate K. D. Matanzima, now the chief minister of the \u201cselfgoverning\u201d Transkei, were also imprisoned with us.\nThis became our core group of about twenty prisoners. Some I knew, some I had heard of, while others I did not know at all. Normally, in prison,\none of the few festive times is seeing old friends and new faces, but the atmosphere in those first few weeks was so oppressive we were not even\nable to greet each other. We had as many guards as prisoners, and they enforced every regulation with threats and intimidation.\n\nThat first week we began the work that would occupy us for the next few months. Each morning, a load of stones about the size of volleyballs was\ndumped by the entrance to the courtyard. Using wheelbarrows, we moved the stones to the center of the yard. We were given either four-pound\nhammers or fourteen-pound hammers for the larger stones. Our job was to crush the stones into gravel. We were divided into four rows, about a\nyard-and-a-half apart, and sat cross-legged on the ground. We were each given a thick rubber ring, made from tires, in which to place the stones.\nThe ring was meant to catch flying chips of stone, but hardly ever did so. We wore makeshift wire masks to protect our eyes.\nWarders walked among us to enforce the silence. During those first few weeks, warders from other sections and even other prisons came to\nstare at us as if we were a collection of rare caged animals. The work was tedious and difficult; it was not strenuous enough to keep us warm but it\nwas demanding enough to make all our muscles ache.\nJune and July were the bleakest months on Robben Island. Winter was in the air, and the rains were just beginning. It never seemed to go above\nforty degrees Fahrenheit. Even in the sun, I shivered in my light khaki shirt. It was then that I first understood the clich\u00e9 of feeling the cold in one\u2019s\nbones. At noon we would break for lunch. That first week all we were given was soup, which stank horribly. In the afternoon, we were permitted to\nexercise for half an hour under strict supervision. We walked briskly around the courtyard in single file.\nOn one of our first days pounding rocks, a warder commanded Kathy to take a wheelbarrow filled with gravel to the truck parked by the entrance.\nKathy was a slender fellow unused to hard physical labor. He could not budge the wheelbarrow. The warders yelled: \u201cLaat daardie kruiwa loop!\u201d (Let\nthat wheelbarrow move!) As Kathy managed to nudge it forward, the wheelbarrow looked as if it would tip over, and the warders began to laugh.\nKathy, I could see, was determined not to give them cause for mirth. I knew how to maneuver the wheelbarrows, and I jumped up to help him. Before\nbeing ordered to sit down, I managed to tell Kathy to wheel it slowly, that it was a matter of balance not strength. He nodded and then carefully\nmoved the wheelbarrow across the courtyard. The warders stopped smiling.\nThe next morning, the authorities placed an enormous bucket in the courtyard and announced that it had to be half full by the end of the week. We\nworked hard and succeeded. The following week, the warder in charge announced that we must now fill the bucket three-quarters of the way. We\nworked with great diligence and succeeded. The next week we were ordered to fill the bucket to the top. We knew we could not tolerate this much\nlonger, but said nothing. We even managed to fill the bucket all the way, but the warders had provoked us. In stolen whispers we resolved on a\npolicy: no quotas. The next week we initiated our first go-slow strike on the island: we would work at less than half the speed we had before to\nprotest the excessive and unfair demands. The guards immediately saw this and threatened us, but we would not increase our pace, and we\ncontinued this go-slow strategy for as long as we worked in the courtyard.\n* * *\nRobben Island had changed since I had been there for a fortnight\u2019s stay in . In , there were few prisoners; the place seemed more like an\nexperiment than a fully-fledged prison. Two years later, Robben Island was without question the harshest, most iron-fisted outpost in the South\nAfrican penal system. It was a hardship station not only for the prisoners but for the prison staff. Gone were the Coloured warders who had supplied\ncigarettes and sympathy. The warders were white and overwhelmingly Afrikaans-speaking, and they demanded a master-servant relationship. They\nordered us to call them \u201cbaas,\u201d which we refused. The racial divide on Robben Island was absolute: there were no black warders, and no white\nprisoners.\nMoving from one prison to another always requires a period of adjustment. But journeying to Robben Island was like going to another country. Its\nisolation made it not simply another prison, but a world of its own, far removed from the one we had come from. The high spirits with which we left\nPretoria had been snuffed out by its stern atmosphere; we were face to face with the realization that our life would be unredeemably grim. In\nPretoria, we felt connected to our supporters and our families; on the island, we felt cut off, and indeed we were. We had the consolation of being\nwith each other, but that was the only consolation. My dismay was quickly replaced by a sense that a new and different fight had begun.\n\nFrom the first day, I had protested about being forced to wear short trousers. I demanded to see the head of the prison and made a list of\n\n\fcomplaints. The warders ignored my protests, but by the end of the second week, I found a pair of old khaki trousers unceremoniously dumped on\nthe floor of my cell. No pin-striped three-piece suit has ever pleased me as much. But before putting them on I checked to see if my comrades had\nbeen issued trousers as well.\nThey had not, and I told the warder to take them back. I insisted that all African prisoners must have long trousers. The warder grumbled,\n\u201cMandela, you say you want long pants and then you don\u2019t want them when we give them to you.\u201d The warder balked at touching trousers worn by a\nblack man, and finally the commanding officer himself came to my cell to pick them up. \u201cVery well, Mandela,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are going to have the\nsame clothing as everyone else.\u201d I replied that if he was willing to give me long trousers, why couldn\u2019t everyone else have them? He did not have an\nanswer.\n AT THE END of our first two weeks on the island, we were informed that our lawyers, Bram Fischer and Joel Joffe, were going to be visiting the\nfollowing day. When they arrived, we were escorted to the visiting area to meet them. The purpose of their visit was twofold: to see how we had\nsettled in, and to verify that we still did not want to appeal our sentences. It had only been a few weeks since I had seen them, but it felt like an\neternity. They seemed like visitors from another world.\nWe sat in an empty room, a major just outside supervising the consultation. I felt like hugging them, but I was restrained by the presence of the\nmajor. I told them that all of us were well, and explained that we were still opposed to an appeal for all the reasons we had previously enunciated,\nincluding the fact that we did not want our appeal to interfere with the cases of other ANC defendants. Bram and Joel seemed resigned to this,\nthough I knew Bram believed we should mount an appeal.\nWhen we were winding up our conversation, I briefly asked Bram about Molly, his wife. No sooner had I pronounced Molly\u2019s name than Bram\nstood up, turned away, and abruptly walked out of the room. A few minutes later, he returned, once again composed, and resumed the\nconversation, but without answering my question.\nOur meeting ended shortly afterward, and when we were walking back to our cells with the major, he said to me, \u201cMandela, were you struck by the\nbehavior of Bram Fischer?\u201d I said that I had been. He told me that Molly had died in a car accident the previous week. Bram, he said, had been\ndriving and had swerved to avoid an animal in the road, and the car had plunged into a river. Molly had drowned.\nWe were devastated by the news. Molly was a wonderful woman, generous and unselfish, utterly without prejudice. She had supported Bram in\nmore ways than it was possible to know. She had been wife, colleague, and comrade. Bram had already experienced disaster in his life: his son\nhad died of cystic fibrosis in adolescence.\nThe act of turning away when I asked about Molly was typical of Bram\u2019s character. He was a stoic, a man who never burdened his friends with his\nown pain and troubles. As an Afrikaner whose conscience forced him to reject his own heritage and be ostracized by his own people, he showed a\nlevel of courage and sacrifice that was in a class by itself. I fought only against injustice, not my own people.\nI informed the major that I intended to write Bram a condolence letter, and he responded that I could do so. The rules governing letter-writing were\nthen extremely strict. We were only permitted to write to our immediate families, and just one letter of five hundred words every six months. I was\ntherefore surprised and pleased when the major did not oppose my writing Bram. But he didn\u2019t live up to his agreement. I wrote the letter and\nhanded it over to the major, but it was never posted.\n\nWithin a few months, our life settled into a pattern. Prison life is about routine: each day like the one before; each week like the one before it, so that\nthe months and years blend into each other. Anything that departs from this pattern upsets the authorities, for routine is the sign of a well-run prison.\nRoutine is also comforting for the prisoner, which is why it can be a trap. Routine can be a pleasant mistress whom it is hard to resist, for routine\nmakes the time go faster. Watches and timepieces of any kind were barred on Robben Island, so we never knew precisely what time it was. We\nwere dependent on bells and warders\u2019 whistles and shouts. With each week resembling the one before, one must make an effort to recall what day\nand month it is. One of the first things I did was to make a calendar on the wall of my cell. Losing a sense of time is an easy way to lose one\u2019s grip\nand even one\u2019s sanity.\nTime slows down in prison; the days seem endless. The clich\u00e9 of time passing slowly usually has to do with idleness and inactivity. But this was\nnot the case on Robben Island. We were busy almost all the time, with work, study, resolving disputes. Yet, time nevertheless moved glacially. This\nis partially because things that took a few hours or days outside would take months or years in prison. A request for a new toothbrush might take six\nmonths or a year to be filled. Ahmed Kathrada once said that in prison the minutes can seem like years, but the years go by like minutes. An\nafternoon pounding rocks in the courtyard might seem like forever, but suddenly it is the end of the year, and you do not know where all the months\nwent.\nThe challenge for every prisoner, particularly every political prisoner, is how to survive prison intact, how to emerge from prison undiminished,\nhow to conserve and even replenish one\u2019s beliefs. The first task in accomplishing that is learning exactly what one must do to survive. To that end,\none must know the enemy\u2019s purpose before adopting a strategy to undermine it. Prison is designed to break one\u2019s spirit and destroy one\u2019s resolve.\nTo do this, the authorities attempt to exploit every weakness, demolish every initiative, negate all signs of individuality \u2014 all with the idea of\nstamping out that spark that makes each of us human and each of us who we are.\nOur survival depended on understanding what the authorities were attempting to do to us, and sharing that understanding with each other. It\nwould be very hard if not impossible for one man alone to resist. I do not know that I could have done it had I been alone. But the authorities\u2019\ngreatest mistake was keeping us together, for together our determination was reinforced. We supported each other and gained strength from each\nother. Whatever we knew, whatever we learned, we shared, and by sharing we multiplied whatever courage we had individually. That is not to say\nthat we were all alike in our responses to the hardships we suffered. Men have different capacities and react differently to stress. But the stronger\nones raised up the weaker ones, and both became stronger in the process. Ultimately, we had to create our own lives in prison. In a way that even\nthe authorities acknowledged, order in prison was preserved not by the warders but by ourselves.\nAs a leader, one must sometimes take actions that are unpopular, or whose results will not be known for years to come. There are victories\nwhose glory lies only in the fact that they are known to those who win them. This is particularly true of prison, where one must find consolation in\nbeing true to one\u2019s ideals, even if no one else knows of it.\nI was now on the sidelines, but I also knew that I would not give up the fight. I was in a different and smaller arena, an arena for whom the only\naudience was ourselves and our oppressors. We regarded the struggle in prison as a microcosm of the struggle as a whole. We would fight inside\nas we had fought outside. The racism and repression were the same; I would simply have to fight on different terms.\nPrison and the authorities conspire to rob each man of his dignity. In and of itself, that assured that I would survive, for any man or institution that\ntries to rob me of my dignity will lose because I will not part with it at any price or under any pressure. I never seriously considered the possibility that\nI would not emerge from prison one day. I never thought that a life sentence truly meant life and that I would die behind bars. Perhaps I was denying\nthis prospect because it was too unpleasant to contemplate. But I always knew that someday I would once again feel the grass under my feet and\nwalk in the sunshine as a free man.\nI am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping one\u2019s head pointed\ntoward the sun, one\u2019s feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could\nnot give myself up to despair. That way lay defeat and death. WE WERE AWAKENED at : each morning by the night warder, who clanged a brass bell at the head of our corridor and yelled, \u201cWord wakker!\nStaan op!\u201d (Wake up! Get up!) I have always been an early riser and this hour was not a burden to me. Although we were roused at :, we were\nnot let out of our cells until :, by which time we were meant to have cleaned our cells and rolled up our mats and blankets. We had no running\nwater in our cells and instead of toilets had iron sanitary buckets known as \u201cballies.\u201d The ballies had a diameter of ten inches and a concave\nporcelain lid on the top that could contain water. The water in this lid was meant to be used for shaving and to clean our hands and faces.\nAt :, when we were let out of our cells, the first thing we did was to empty our ballies. The ballies had to be thoroughly cleansed in the sinks at\nthe end of the hallway or they created a stench. The only pleasant thing about cleaning one\u2019s ballie was that this was the one moment in those early\ndays when we could have a whispered word with our colleagues. The warders did not like to linger when we cleaned them, so it was a chance to\ntalk softly.\nDuring those first few months, breakfast was delivered to us in our cells by prisoners from the general section. Breakfast consisted of mealie pap\nporridge, cereal made from maize or corn, which the general prisoners would slop in a bowl and then spin through the bars of our cells. It was a\nclever trick and required a deft hand so as not to spill any of the porridge.\nAfter a few months, breakfast was delivered to us in the courtyard in old metal oil drums. We would help ourselves to pap using simple metal\nbowls. We each received a mug of what was described as coffee, but which was in fact ground-up maize, baked until it was black, and then brewed\nwith hot water. Later, when we were able to go into the courtyard to serve ourselves, I would go out into the courtyard and jog around the perimeter\nuntil breakfast arrived.\nLike everything else in prison, diet is discriminatory.\nIn general, Coloureds and Indians received a slightly better diet than Africans, but it was not much of a distinction. The authorities liked to say that\nwe received a balanced diet; it was indeed balanced \u2014 between the unpalatable and the inedible. Food was the source of many of our protests,\nbut in those early days, the warders would say, \u201cAg, you kaffirs are eating better in prison than you ever ate at home!\u201d\n\nIn the midst of breakfast, the guards would yell, \u201cVal in! Val in!\u201d (Fall in! Fall in!), and we would stand outside our cells for inspection. Each prisoner\nwas required to have the three buttons of his khaki jacket properly buttoned. We were required to doff our hats as the warder walked by. If our\nbuttons were undone, our hats unremoved, or our cells untidy, we were charged with a violation of the prison code and punished with either solitary\nconfinement or the loss of meals.\nAfter inspection we would work in the courtyard hammering stones until noon. There were no breaks; if we slowed down, the warders would yell at\nus to speed up. At noon, the bell would clang for lunch and another metal drum of food would be wheeled into the courtyard. For Africans, lunch\nconsisted of boiled mealies, that is, coarse kernels of corn. The Indian and Coloured prisoners received samp, or mealie rice, which consisted of\nground mealies in a souplike mixture. The samp was sometimes served with vegetables whereas our mealies were served straight.\nFor lunch we often received phuzamandla, which means \u201cdrink of strength,\u201d a powder made from mealies and a bit of yeast. It is meant to be\nstirred into water or milk and when it is thick, it can be tasty, but the prison authorities gave us so little of the powder that it barely colored the water. I\nwould usually try to save my powder for several days until I had enough to make a proper drink, but if the authorities discovered that you were\nhoarding food, the powder was confiscated and you were punished.\nAfter lunch we worked until four, when the guards blew shrill whistles and we once again lined up to be counted and inspected. We were then\npermitted half an hour to clean up. The bathroom at the end of our corridor had two seawater showers, a saltwater tap, and three large galvanized\nmetal buckets, which were used as bathtubs. There was no hot water. We would stand or squat in these buckets, soaping ourselves with the\nbrackish water, rinsing off the dust from the day. To wash yourself with cold water when it is cold outside is not pleasant, but we made the best of it.\nWe would sometimes sing while washing, which made the water seem less icy. In those early days, this was one of the only times that we could\nconverse.\nPrecisely at :, there would be a loud knock on the wooden door at the end of our corridor, which meant that supper had been delivered.\nCommon-law prisoners were used to dish out the food to us and we would return to our cells to eat it. We again received mealie pap porridge,\nsometimes with the odd carrot or piece of cabbage or beetroot thrown in \u2014 but one usually had to search for it. If we did get a vegetable, we would\nusually have the same one for weeks on end, until the carrots or cabbage were old and moldy and we were thoroughly sick of them. Every other\nday, we received a small piece of meat with our porridge. The meat was usually mostly gristle.\nFor supper, Coloured and Indian prisoners received a quarter loaf of bread (known as a katkop, that is, a cat\u2019s head, after the shape of the\nbread) and a slab of margarine. Africans, it was presumed, did not care for bread as it was a \u201cEuropean\u201d type of food.\nTypically, we received even less than the meager amounts stipulated in the regulations. This was because the kitchen was rife with smuggling.\nThe cooks \u2014 all of whom were common-law prisoners \u2014 kept the best food for themselves or their friends. Often they would lay aside the tastiest\nmorsels for the warders in exchange for favors or preferential treatment.\nAt  P.M., the night warder would lock himself in the corridor with us, passing the key through a small hole in the door to another warder outside.\nThe warder would then walk up and down the corridor, ordering us to go to sleep. No cry of \u201clights out\u201d was ever given on Robben Island because\nthe single mesh-covered bulb in our cell burned day and night. Later, those studying for higher degrees were permitted to read until ten or eleven.\nThe acoustics along the corridor were quite good, and we would try to chat a bit to each other before going to sleep. But if we could hear a\nwhisper quite clearly, so could the warder, who would yell, \u201cStilte in die gang!\u201d (Quiet in the passage!) The warder would walk up and down a few\ntimes to make sure we were not reading or writing. After a few months, we would sprinkle a handful of sand along the corridor so that we could hear\nthe warder\u2019s footsteps and have time to stop talking or hide any contraband. Only when we were quiet did he take a seat in the small office at the\nend of the passage where he dozed until morning.\n ALTHOUGH I DID NOT GET a direct response from Kobie Coetsee, there were other signs that the government was preparing me for a different\nkind of existence. On the day before Christmas, Lieutenant Colonel Gawie Marx, the deputy commander of Pollsmoor, wandered by my cell after\nbreakfast and said quite casually, \u201cMandela, would you like to see the city?\u201d I was not exactly certain what he had in mind, but I thought there was no\nharm in saying yes. Good, he said, come along. I walked with the colonel through the fifteen locked metal doors between my cell and the entrance,\nand when we emerged, I found his car waiting for us.\nWe drove into Cape Town along the lovely road that runs parallel to the coast. He had no destination in mind and simply meandered around the\ncity in a leisurely fashion. It was absolutely riveting to watch the simple activities of people out in the world: old men sitting in the sun, women doing\ntheir shopping, people walking their dogs. It is precisely those mundane activities of daily life that one misses most in prison. I felt like a curious\ntourist in a strange and remarkable land.\nAfter an hour or so, Colonel Marx stopped the car in front of a small shop on a quiet street. \u201cWould you like a cold drink?\u201d he asked me. I nodded,\nand he disappeared inside the shop. I sat there alone. For the first few moments, I did not think about my situation, but as the seconds ticked away,\nI became more and more agitated. For the first time in twenty-two years, I was out in the world and unguarded. I had a vision of opening the door,\njumping out, and then running and running until I was out of sight. Something inside was urging me to do just that. I noticed a wooded area near the\nroad where I could hide. I was extremely tense and began to perspire. Where was the colonel? But then I took control of myself; such an action\nwould be unwise and irresponsible, not to mention dangerous. It was possible that the whole situation was contrived to try to get me to escape,\nthough I do not think that was the case. I was greatly relieved a few moments later when I saw the colonel walking back to the car with two cans of\nCoca-Cola.\nAs it turned out, that day in Cape Town was the first of many excursions. Over the next few months, I went out again with the colonel not only to\nCape Town but to some of the sights around the city, its beautiful beaches and lovely cool mountains. Soon, more junior officers were permitted to\ntake me around. One of the places I regularly visited with these junior officers was known as the \u201cgardens,\u201d a series of smallholdings on the edge of\nthe prison grounds where crops were grown for the prison\u2019s kitchen. I enjoyed being out in nature, being able to see the horizon and feel the sun on\nmy shoulders.\nOne day I went to the gardens with a captain, and after walking in the fields we strolled over to the stables. There were two young white men in\noveralls working with the horses. I walked over to them, praised one of the animals, and said to the fellow, \u201cNow, what is this horse\u2019s name?\u201d The\nyoung man seemed quite nervous and did not look at me. He then mumbled the name of the horse, but to the captain, not me. I then asked the other\nfellow in turn what the name of his horse was, and he had precisely the same reaction.\nAs I was walking back to the prison with the captain, I commented on what I thought was the curious behavior of the two young men. The captain\nlaughed. \u201cMandela, don\u2019t you know what those two chaps were?\u201d I said I did not. \u201cThey were white prisoners. They had never been questioned by a\nnative prisoner in the presence of a white officer before.\u201d\nSome of the younger warders took me quite far afield, and we would walk on the beach and even stop at a caf\u00e9 and have tea. At such places, I\noften tried to see if people recognized me, but no one ever did; the last published picture of me had been taken in .\nThese trips were instructive on a number of levels. I saw how life had changed in the time I had been away, and because we mainly went to white\nareas, I saw the extraordinary wealth and ease that whites enjoyed. Though the country was in upheaval and the townships were on the brink of\nopen warfare, white life went on placidly and undisturbed. Their lives were unaffected. Once, one of the warders, a very pleasant young man named\nWarrant Officer Brand, actually took me to his family\u2019s flat and introduced me to his wife and children. From then on, I sent his children Christmas\ncards every year.\nAs much as I enjoyed these little adventures, I well knew that the authorities had a motive other than keeping me diverted. I sensed that they\nwanted to acclimatize me to life in South Africa and perhaps at the same time, get me so used to the pleasures of small freedoms that I might be\nwilling to compromise in order to have complete freedom. ON FRIDAY, JUNE , , we entered court for the last time. Nearly a year had passed since the fateful arrests at Rivonia. Security was\nextraordinarily high. Our convoy raced through the streets with sirens wailing. All the roads leading to the courthouse had been blocked off to normal\ntraffic. The police checked the identification of anyone attempting to go near the Palace of Justice. They had even set up checkpoints at the local\nbus and railway stations. Despite the intimidation, as many as two thousand people assembled in front of the courthouse holding banners and\nsigns such as \u201cWE STAND BY OUR LEADERS.\u201d Inside, the spectators\u2019 gallery was full, and it was standing room only for the local and foreign\npress.\nI waved hello to Winnie and my mother. It was heartening to see them there; my mother had journeyed all the way from the Transkei. It must be a\nvery odd sensation to come to a courtroom to see whether or not your son will be sentenced to death. Though I suspect my mother did not\nunderstand all that was going on, her support never wavered. Winnie was equally stalwart, and her strength gave me strength.\nThe registrar called out the case: \u201cThe State against Mandela and others.\u201d Before the sentence was to be passed, there were two pleas in\nmitigation. One was delivered by Harold Hanson and the other by the author Alan Paton, who was also national president of the Liberal Party.\nHanson spoke eloquently, saying that a nation\u2019s grievances cannot be suppressed, that people will always find a way to give voice to those\ngrievances. \u201cIt was not their aims which had been criminal,\u201d said Hanson, \u201conly the means to which they had resorted.\u201d Hanson said the judge would\ndo well to recall that his own people, the Afrikaners, had struggled violently for their freedom.\nThough Paton did not himself support violence, he said the accused had had only two alternatives: \u201cto bow their heads and submit, or to resist by\nforce.\u201d The defendants should receive clemency, he said, otherwise the future of South Africa would be bleak.\nBut de Wet did not seem to be listening to either man. He neither looked up nor took any notes while they spoke. He seemed absorbed in his\nown thoughts. He had obviously already decided; he was merely waiting for the moment to reveal his decision.\n\nHe nodded for us to rise. I tried to catch his eye, but he was not even looking in our direction. His eyes were focused on the middle distance. His\nface was very pale, and he was breathing heavily. We looked at each other and seemed to know: it would be death, otherwise why was this\nnormally calm man so nervous? And then he began to speak.\nI have heard a great deal during the course of this case about the grievances of the non-European population. The accused have told me and their counsel have told me that the\naccused who were all leaders of the non-European population were motivated entirely by a desire to ameliorate these grievances. I am by no means convinced that the motives of\nthe accused were as altruistic as they wish the court to believe. People who organize a revolution usually take over the government and personal ambition cannot be excluded as a\nmotive.\n\nHe paused for a moment as if to catch his breath. De Wet\u2019s voice, which was muted before, was now barely audible.\nThe function of this court as is the function of the court in any other country is to enforce law and order and to enforce the laws of the state within which it functions. The crime of\nwhich the accused have been convicted, that is the main crime, the crime of conspiracy, is in essence one of high treason. The state has decided not to charge the crime in this\nform. Bearing this in mind and giving the matter very serious consideration I have decided not to impose the supreme penalty which in a case like this would usually be the proper\npenalty for the crime, but consistent with my duty that is the only leniency which I can show. The sentence in the case of all the accused will be one of life imprisonment.\n\nWe looked at each other and smiled. There had been a great collective gasp in the courtroom when de Wet announced that he was not\nsentencing us to death. But there was consternation among some spectators because they had been unable to hear de Wet\u2019s sentence. Dennis\nGoldberg\u2019s wife called to him, \u201cDennis, what is it!?\u201d\n\u201cLife!\u201d he yelled back, grinning. \u201cLife! To live!\u201d\nI turned and smiled broadly to the gallery, searching out Winnie\u2019s face and that of my mother, but it was extremely confused in the court, with\npeople shouting, police pushing the crowd this way and that. I could not see them. I flashed the thumbs-up ANC salute as many of the spectators\nwere dashing outside to tell the crowd the verdict. Our police guardians began to hustle us out of the dock and toward the door leading\nunderground, and although I looked again for Winnie\u2019s face, I was not able to see her before I ducked through the door leading to the cells below.\n\nWe were kept handcuffed in the cells underneath the courthouse. The police were extremely nervous about the crowd outside. They kept us\nunderground for more than half an hour, hoping people would disperse. We were taken through the back of the building and entered the black van.\nWe could hear the motorcycle escort revving up beside us. To avoid the crowd, the van took a different course, but even so, we could hear the\ncrowd shouting \u201cAmandla!\u201d and the slow beautiful rhythms of \u201cNkosi Sikelel\u2019 iAfrika.\u201d We made clenched fists through the bars of the window,\nhoping the crowd could see us, not knowing if they could.\nAll of us were now convicted prisoners. We were separated from Dennis Goldberg because he was white and he was taken to a different facility.\nThe rest of us were locked up in cells in Pretoria Local away from all the other prisoners. Instead of shouts and songs, we now heard only the\nclanging of doors and gates.\n* * *\nThat night, as I lay on my mat on the floor of my cell, I ran over the reasons for de Wet\u2019s decision. The demonstrations throughout South Africa and\nthe international pressure undoubtedly weighed on his mind. International trade unions had protested the trial. Dockworkers\u2019 unions around the\nworld threatened not to handle South African goods. The Russian prime minister, Leonid Brezhnev, wrote to Dr. Verwoerd asking for leniency.\nMembers of the United States Congress protested. Fifty members of the British Parliament had staged a march in London. Alex Douglas-Home,\nthe British foreign secretary, was rumored to be working behind the scenes to help our cause. Adlai Stevenson, the U.S. representative at the U.N.,\nwrote a letter saying that his government would do everything it could to prevent a death sentence. I thought that once de Wet had accepted that we\nhad not yet initiated guerrilla warfare and that the ANC and MK were separate entities, it would have been difficult to impose the death penalty; it\nwould have seemed excessive.\nVerwoerd told Parliament that the judgment had not been influenced by the telegrams of protest and representations that had come in from\naround the world. He boasted that he had tossed into the wastebasket all the telegrams from socialist nations.\nTowards the end of the proceedings, Judge de Wet had remarked in passing to Bram Fischer that the defense had generated a great deal of\n\n\fworldwide propaganda in the case. This was perhaps his own way of acknowledging the pressure. He knew that if we were executed, the great\nmajority of the people would regard him as our killer.\nYet he was under even greater pressure from his own people. He was a white Afrikaner, a creature of the South African system and mind-set. He\nhad no inclination to go against the belief system that had formed him. He had succumbed to these pressures by sentencing us to life and resisted\nthem by not giving us death.\nI was surprised and displeased by the sentences de Wet imposed on Kathrada, Motsoaledi, and Mlangeni. I had expected him to discharge\nKathy, and to give Elias and Andrew lighter sentences. The latter two were comparatively junior members of MK, and the combined offenses of the\nthree of them could hardly be compared with those of the rest of us. But by not appealing, we undoubtedly cost Kathy, Andrew, and Elias: an\nappeals court might have cut down their sentences.\nEvery evening, in Pretoria Local, before lights were out, the jail would echo to African prisoners singing freedom songs. We too would sing in this\ngreat swelling chorus. But, each evening, seconds before the lights were dimmed, as if in obedience to some silent command, the hum of voices\nwould stop and the entire jail would become silent. Then, from a dozen places throughout the prison, men would yell \u201cAmandla!\u201d This would be met\nby hundreds of voices replying \u201cNgawethu!\u201d Often, we would start this call-and-response ourselves, but that night, other nameless prisoners took the\ninitiative, and the voices from around the prison seemed uncommonly strong as though steeling us for what lay ahead. ONE DAY in the summer of , we discovered some fat glistening on our porridge at breakfast and chunks of fresh meat with our pap at supper.\nThe next day some of the men received new shirts. The guards at the quarry and the warders in our section seemed a bit more deferential. All of us\nwere suspicious; in prison, no improvement happens without a reason. A day later we were notified that the International Red Cross would be\narriving the following day.\nThis was a crucial occasion, more important than any of our previous visitors. The Red Cross was responsible and independent, an international\norganization to whom the Western powers and the United Nations paid attention. The prison authorities respected the Red Cross \u2014 and by\nrespected, I mean feared, for the authorities respected only what they were afraid of. The prison service distrusted all organizations that could affect\nworld opinion, and regarded them not as legitimate investigators to be dealt with honestly but as meddling interlopers to be hoodwinked if possible.\nAvoiding international condemnation was the authorities\u2019 principal goal.\nIn those early years, the International Red Cross was the only organization that both listened to our complaints and responded to them. This was\nvital, because the authorities ignored us. Regulations required that the authorities provide some official procedure for acknowledging our\ncomplaints. They did so, but only in the most perfunctory manner. Every Saturday morning, the chief warder would come into our section and call\nout, \u201cKlagtes en Versoeke! Klagtes en Versoeke!\u201d (Complaints and Requests! Complaints and Requests!) Those of us with klagtes and versoeke\n\u2014 which was nearly everyone \u2014 lined up to see the chief warder. One by one, we would make formal complaints about food, or clothing, or visits.\nTo each, the chief warder would nod his head and simply say, \u201cJa, ja,\u201d and then, \u201cNext!\u201d He did not even write down what we said. If we tried to\nspeak for our organizations, the warders would yell, \u201cNo ANC or PAC here! Verstaan?\u201d (Understand?)\n\nShortly before the Red Cross\u2019s visit we had submitted a formal list of complaints to the commissioner of prisons. At the time we were only\npermitted paper and pencil to write letters. We had secretly consulted with each other at the quarry and in the lavatory, and put together a list. We\nsubmitted it to our chief warder, who did not want to take it and accused us of violating regulations by making such a list. One of our complaints to\nthe Red Cross would be that the authorities did not listen to our complaints.\nOn the day of their visit, I was called to the head office to meet with the Red Cross representative. That year, and for the following few years, the\nrepresentative was a Mr. Senn, a former director of prisons in his native Sweden who had emigrated to Rhodesia. Senn was a quiet, rather\nnervous man in his mid-fifties who did not seem at all comfortable in his surroundings.\nThe meeting was not monitored, a critical difference from nearly all of our other visitors. He asked to hear all of our complaints and grievances,\nand listened very carefully, taking extensive notes. He was very courteous and thanked me for all that I told him. Even so, that first visit was rather\ntense. Neither of us yet knew what to expect from the other.\nI complained quite vociferously about our clothing, affirming that we did not want to wear short trousers and needed proper clothing including\nsocks and underwear, which we were not then given. I recounted our grievances regarding food, visits, letters, studies, exercise, hard labor, and the\nbehavior of warders. I made certain requests I knew the authorities would never satisfy, such as our desire to be transferred to prisons nearer our\nhomes.\nAfter our session, Senn met with the commissioner of prisons and his staff while I waited. I assumed that he relayed our complaints to the\nauthorities, indicating the ones he thought were reasonable. Not long after Senn\u2019s visit our clothing did improve and we were given long trousers.\nBut Senn was not a progressive fellow by any means; his years in Rhodesia seemed to have acclimatized him to racism. Before I had returned to\nmy cell, I reminded him of our complaint that African prisoners did not receive bread. Mr. Senn appeared flustered, and glanced over at the colonel,\nwho was head of the prison. \u201cBread is very bad for your teeth, you know, Mandela,\u201d Mr. Senn said. \u201cMealies are much better for you. They make\nyour teeth strong.\u201d\nIn later years, the International Red Cross sent more liberal men who wholeheartedly fought for improvements. The organization also played a\ncritical role in an area that was less obvious but no less important to us. They often provided money to wives and relatives who would not otherwise\nhave been able to visit us on the island.\n\nAfter we had been sent to Robben Island, there was concern among our supporters that we would not be permitted to study. Within a few months of\nour arrival, the authorities announced that those who wanted to study could apply for permission. Most of the men did so and even though they were\nD Group prisoners, permission was granted. The state, after the Rivonia Trial, was feeling confident and thought giving us study privileges would be\nharmless. Later, they came to regret it. Postgraduate study was not permitted, but they made an exception in my case because I had established a\nprecedent when I was in Pretoria.\nVery few of the men in our section had B.A.\u2019s and many registered for university-level courses. Quite a few did not have high school degrees and\nelected courses to qualify for that degree. Some of the men were already well educated, like Govan Mbeki and Neville Alexander, but others had\nnot gone past Standard V or VI. Within months, virtually all of us were studying for one degree or another. At night, our cell block seemed more like\na study hall than a prison.\nBut the privilege of studying came with a host of conditions. Certain subjects, such as politics and military history, were prohibited. For years, we\nwere not permitted to receive funds except from our families, so that poor prisoners rarely had money for books or tuition. This made the\nopportunity to study a function of how much money one had. Nor were we permitted to lend books to other prisoners, which would have enabled our\npoorer colleagues to study.\nThere was always controversy about whether or not we should accept study privileges. Some members of the Unity Movement at first felt that we\nwere accepting a handout from the government, which compromised our integrity. They argued that studying should not be a conditional privilege\nbut an unfettered right. While I agreed, I could not accept that we should therefore disavow studying. As freedom fighters and political prisoners, we\nhad an obligation to improve and strengthen ourselves, and study was one of the few opportunities to do so.\nPrisoners were permitted to enroll at either the University of South Africa (UNISA) or Rapid Results College, which was for those studying for\ntheir high school qualification. In my own case, studying under the auspices of the University of London was a mixed blessing. On the one hand I\nwas assigned the sorts of stimulating books that would not have been on a South African reading list; on the other, the authorities inevitably\nregarded many of them as unsuitable and thus banned them.\nReceiving books at all was often a challenge. You might make an application to a South African library for a book on contract law. They would\n\n\fprocess your request and then send you the book by post. But because of the vagaries of the mail system, the remoteness of the island, and the\noften deliberate slowness of the censors, the book would reach you after the date that it needed to be returned. If the date had passed, the warders\nwould typically send the book back without even showing it to you. Given the nature of the system, you might receive a late fine without ever having\nreceived the book.\nIn addition to books, we were permitted to order publications necessary to our studies. The authorities were extremely strict about this, and the\nonly kind of publication that would pass muster might be a quarterly on actuarial science for a prisoner studying accounting. But one day, Mac\nMaharaj told a comrade who was studying economics to request The Economist. We laughed and said we might as well ask for Time magazine,\nbecause The Economist was also a newsweekly. But Mac simply smiled and said the authorities wouldn\u2019t know that; they judged a book by its title.\nWithin a month, we were receiving The Economist and reading the news we hungered for. But the authorities soon discovered their mistake and\nended the subscription.\nOnce most of the men began to study, we complained that we did not even have the minimum facilities necessary for studying, such as desks\nand chairs. I made this complaint to the International Red Cross. Finally, the authorities built in each cell a kind of stand-up desk, a simple wooden\nboard that jutted out from the wall at about chest-level.\nThis was not precisely what we had envisaged. After a tedious day at the quarry, one did not much feel like working at a stand-up desk. A\nnumber of us complained about the desks, and Kathy was the most vociferous. He informed the commanding officer that not only was it an\nimposition to have stand-up desks, but that they sloped so steeply that the books fell off. The commanding officer made a surprise visit to Kathy\u2019s\ncell, asked for a book, and plunked it on his desk. It did not move. He asked Kathy for another and placed it on top of the first one; again, nothing\nhappened. Finally, after placing four books on the desk, he turned to a sheepish Kathy and said, \u201cAg, there\u2019s nothing wrong with these desks,\u201d and\nwalked out. But about six months later, the authorities relented and we were given three-legged wooden stools and the stand-up desks were\nlowered.\n\nOne complaint I voiced to the International Red Cross concerned the arbitrary way we were charged by the warders. To be \u201ccharged\u201d meant that a\nwarder claimed that a prisoner had violated a specific regulation, which could be punished by isolation or by loss of meals and privileges. Warders\ngenerally did not treat this lightly, for when a prisoner was charged he was allowed a judicial hearing and, depending on the seriousness of the\noffense, a magistrate was brought in from Cape Town. At the time, the authorities were refusing to permit hearings. When I complained to the\nInternational Red Cross about this, I had yet to experience the problem myself. But that situation was soon remedied.\nOn weekends, during our first year on the island, we were kept inside our cells all day except for a half hour of exercise. One Saturday, after\nreturning from exercise in the courtyard, I noticed that a warder had left a newspaper on the bench at the end of the corridor. He had become rather\nfriendly to us, and I assumed that he had not left the newspaper there by accident.\nNewspapers were more valuable to political prisoners than gold or diamonds, more hungered for than food or tobacco; they were the most\nprecious contraband on Robben Island. News was the intellectual raw material of the struggle. We were not allowed any news at all, and we craved\nit. Walter, even more than myself, seemed bereft without news. The authorities attempted to impose a complete blackout; they did not want us to\nlearn anything that might raise our morale or reassure us that people on the outside were still thinking about us.\nWe regarded it as our duty to keep ourselves current on the politics of the country, and we fought long and hard for the right to have newspapers.\nOver the years, we devised many ways of obtaining them, but back then we were not so adept. One of the advantages of going to the quarry was\nthat warders\u2019 sandwiches were wrapped in newspaper and they would often discard these newsprint wrappers in the trash, where we secretly\nretrieved them. We would distract the warders\u2019 attention, pluck the papers out of the garbage, and slide them into our shirts.\nOne of the most reliable ways to acquire papers was through bribery, and this was the only area where I tolerated what were often unethical\nmeans of obtaining information. The warders always seemed to be short of money, and their poverty was our opportunity.\nWhen we did get hold of a paper, it was far too risky to pass around. Possession of a newspaper was a serious charge. Instead, one person\nwould read the paper, usually Kathy or, later, Mac Maharaj. Kathy was in charge of communications, and he had thought of ingenious ways for us to\npass information. Kathy would go through the paper and make cuttings of relevant stories, which were then secretly distributed to the rest of us.\nEach of us would write out a summary of the story we were given; these summaries were then passed among us, and later smuggled to the general\nsection. When the authorities were particularly vigilant, Kathy or Mac would write out his summary of the news and then destroy the paper, usually by\ntearing it into small pieces and placing it in his ballie, which the warders never inspected.\n\nWhen I noticed the newspaper lying on the bench, I quickly left my cell, walked to the end of the corridor, looked in both directions, and then plucked\nthe newspaper off the bench and slipped it into my shirt. Normally, I would have hidden the newspaper somewhere in my cell and taken it out only\nafter bedtime. But like a child who eats his sweet before his main course, I was so eager for news that I opened the paper in my cell immediately.\nI don\u2019t know how long I was reading; I was so engrossed in the paper that I did not hear any footsteps. Suddenly, an officer and two other warders\nappeared and I did not even have time to slide the paper under my bed. I was caught black-and-white-handed, so to speak. \u201cMandela,\u201d the officer\nsaid, \u201cwe are charging you for possession of contraband, and you will pay for this.\u201d The two warders then began a thorough search of my cell to see\nif they could turn up anything else.\nWithin a day or two a magistrate was brought in from Cape Town and I was taken to the room at headquarters that was used as the island\u2019s\ncourt. In this instance, the authorities were willing to call in an outside magistrate because they knew they had an open-and-shut case. I offered no\ndefense, and was sentenced to three days in isolation and deprivation of meals.\nI do not think that I was set up by the warder who left the newspaper on the bench, though some assumed I had been. At the hearing, the\nauthorities grilled me as to how I got the newspaper, and I refused to answer. If I had been railroaded, the authorities would have known how I\u2019d\ngotten it.\n\nThe isolation cells were in our same complex, but in another wing. Although just across the courtyard, they felt enormously distant. In isolation, one\nwas deprived of company, exercise, and even food: one received only rice water three times a day for three days. (Rice water is simply water in\nwhich rice has been boiled.) By comparison, our normal ration of pap seemed like a feast.\nThe first day in isolation was always the most painful. One grows accustomed to eating regularly and the body is not used to being deprived. I\nfound that by the second day I had more or less adjusted to the absence of food, and the third passed without much craving at all. Such deprivation\n\n\fwas not uncommon among Africans in everyday life. I myself had gone without food for days at a time in my early years in Johannesburg.\nAs I have already mentioned, I found solitary confinement the most forbidding aspect of prison life. There is no end and no beginning; there is\nonly one\u2019s own mind, which can begin to play tricks. Was that a dream or did it really happen? One begins to question everything. Did I make the\nright decision, was my sacrifice worth it? In solitary, there is no distraction from these haunting questions.\nBut the human body has an enormous capacity for adjusting to trying circumstances. I have found that one can bear the unbearable if one can\nkeep one\u2019s spirits strong even when one\u2019s body is being tested. Strong convictions are the secret of surviving deprivation; your spirit can be full\neven when your stomach is empty.\n\nIn those early years, isolation became a habit. We were routinely charged for the smallest infractions and sentenced to isolation. A man might lose\nhis meals for a sidelong glance or be sentenced for failing to stand when a warder entered the room. Some PAC prisoners, who often flouted the\nrules simply for the sake of doing so, spent a great deal of time in isolation. The authorities believed that isolation was the cure for our defiance and\nrebelliousness.\nThe second time I was charged and spent time in isolation occurred shortly after the first. As I have mentioned, we were having great difficulty\nmaking our complaints heard. The remoteness of the prison made the authorities feel they could ignore us with impunity. They believed that if they\nturned a deaf ear to us, we would give up in frustration and the people on the outside would forget about us.\nOne day we were working at the lime quarry when the commanding officer came to observe us, accompanied by a gentleman whom we at first\ndid not recognize. One of my colleagues whispered to me that it was Brigadier Aucamp from the Head Office, our commanding officer\u2019s\ncommanding officer. (He is not to be confused with the Aucamp of Pretoria Local, who looked after us during the Rivonia Trial.) The two men stood\nat a distance, watching us.\nAucamp was a short, heavyset fellow in a suit rather than a military uniform. He normally came to the island on biannual inspections. On those\noccasions, we were ordered to stand at attention at the grille of our cells and hold up our prison cards as he walked by.\nI decided that Aucamp\u2019s unexpected appearance was a singular opportunity to present our grievances to the man who had the power to remedy\nthem. I put down my pick and began to walk over to them. The warders immediately became alarmed and moved toward me. I knew that I was\nviolating regulations, but I hoped the warders would be so surprised by the novelty of my action that they would do nothing to stop me. That proved\nto be the case.\nWhen I reached the two men, the commanding officer said bluntly, \u201cMandela, go back to your place. No one called you.\u201d I disregarded him and\naddressed Aucamp, saying I had taken this extraordinary action because our complaints were being ignored. The C.O. interrupted me: \u201cMandela, I\norder you back to your place.\u201d I turned to him and said in a measured tone, \u201cI am here already, I will not go back.\u201d I was hoping that Aucamp would\nagree to hear me out, but he studied me coldly and then turned to the warders and said calmly, \u201cCharge him.\u201d\nI continued to speak as the guards led me away. \u201cTake him back to the cells,\u201d the C.O. said. I was charged and, once again, I had no defense.\nThe punishment this time was four days in isolation. There was a lesson in what I had done, a lesson I already knew but had disobeyed out of\ndesperation. No one, least of all prison officials, ever likes to have his authority publicly challenged. In order to respond to me, Aucamp would have\nhad to humiliate his subordinate. Prison officials responded much better to private overtures. The best way to effect change on Robben Island was\nto attempt to influence officials privately rather than publicly. I was sometimes condemned for appearing to be too accommodating to prison\nofficials, but I was willing to accept the criticism in exchange for the improvement. THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON in any prisoner\u2019s life is not the minister of justice, not the commissioner of prisons, not even the head of prison,\nbut the warder in one\u2019s section. If you are cold and want an extra blanket, you might petition the minister of justice, but you will get no response. If\nyou go to the commissioner of prisons, he will say, \u201cSorry, it is against regulations.\u201d The head of prison will say, \u201cIf I give you an extra blanket, I must\ngive one to everyone.\u201d But if you approach the warder in your corridor, and you are on good terms with him, he will simply go to the stockroom and\nfetch a blanket.\nI always tried to be decent to the warders in my section; hostility was self-defeating. There was no point in having a permanent enemy among the\nwarders. It was ANC policy to try to educate all people, even our enemies: we believed that all men, even prison service warders, were capable of\nchange, and we did our utmost to try to sway them.\nIn general we treated the warders as they treated us. If a man was considerate, we were considerate in return. Not all of our warders were ogres.\nWe noticed right from the start that there were some among them who believed in fairness. Yet, being friendly with warders was not an easy\nproposition, for they generally found the idea of being courteous to a black man abhorrent. Because it was useful to have warders who were well\ndisposed toward us, I often asked certain men to make overtures to selected warders. No one liked to take on such a job.\nWe had one warder at the quarry who seemed particularly hostile to us. This was troublesome, for at the quarry we would hold discussions\namong ourselves, and a warder who did not permit us to talk was a great hindrance. I asked a certain comrade to befriend this fellow so that he\nwould not interrupt our talks. The warder was quite crude, but he soon began to relax a bit around this one prisoner. One day, the warder asked this\ncomrade for his jacket so that he could lay it on the grass and sit on it. Even though I knew it went against the comrade\u2019s grain, I nodded to him to\ndo it.\nA few days later, we were having our lunch under the shed when this warder wandered over. The warder had an extra sandwich, and he threw it\non the grass near us and said, \u201cHere.\u201d That was his way of showing friendship.\nThis presented us with a dilemma. On the one hand, he was treating us as animals to whom he could toss a bit of slop, and I felt it would\nundermine our dignity to take the sandwich. On the other hand, we were hungry, and to reject the gesture altogether would humiliate the warder we\nwere trying to befriend. I could see that the comrade who had befriended the warder wanted the sandwich, and I nodded for him to take it.\nThe strategy worked, for this warder became less wary around us. He even began to ask questions about the ANC. By definition, if a man\nworked for the prison service he was probably brainwashed by the government\u2019s propaganda. He would have believed that we were terrorists and\nCommunists who wanted to drive the white man into the sea. But as we quietly explained to him our nonracialism, our desire for equal rights, and\nour plans for the redistribution of wealth, he scratched his head and said, \u201cIt makes more bloody sense than the Nats.\u201d\n\nHaving sympathetic warders facilitated one of our most vital tasks on Robben Island: communication. We regarded it as our duty to stay in touch\nwith our men in F and G, which was where the general prisoners were kept. As politicians, we were just as intent on fortifying our organization in\nprison as we had been outside. Communication was essential if we were to coordinate our protests and complaints. Because of the greater\nnumbers of prisoners coming and going in the general section, the men in F and G tended to have more recent information about not only what was\nhappening in the movement, but about our friends and families.\nCommunication between sections was a serious violation of regulations. We found many effective ways around the ban. The men who delivered\nour drums of food were from the general section, and in the early months we managed to have whispered conversations with them in which we\nconveyed brief messages. We formed a clandestine communications committee, composed of Kathy, Mac Maharaj, Laloo Chiba, and several\nothers, and their job was to organize all such practices.\nOne of the first techniques was engineered by Kathy and Mac, who had noticed that on our walks to the quarry, the warders often tossed away\nempty matchboxes. They began secretly collecting them, and Mac had the idea of constructing a false bottom to the box and placing in it a tiny\nwritten message. Laloo Chiba, who once trained as a tailor, wrote out minuscule coded messages that would be placed in the converted matchbox.\nJoe Gqabi, another MK soldier who was with us, would carry the matchboxes on our walks to the quarry and drop them at a strategic crossing\nwhere we knew the general prisoners would pass. Through whispered conversations at food deliveries, we explained the plan. Designated\nprisoners from F and G would pick up the matchboxes on their walks, and we retrieved messages in the same fashion. It was far from perfect, and\nwe could easily be foiled by something as simple as the rain. We soon evolved more efficient methods.\nWe looked for moments when the warders were inattentive. One such time was during and after meals. We helped ourselves to our food, and we\nworked out a scheme whereby comrades from the general section who worked in the kitchen began placing letters and notes wrapped in plastic at\nthe bottom of the food drums. We sent return communication in a similar way, wrapping notes in the same plastic and placing them at the bottom of\nthe mounds of dirty dishes that were routed back to the kitchen. We would do our best to create a mess, scattering food all over the plates. The\nwarders even complained about the disarray, but never bothered to investigate.\nOur toilets and showers were adjacent to the isolation section. Prisoners from the general section were often sentenced to isolation there and\nwould use the same set of toilets we did, though at different times. Mac devised a method of wrapping notes in plastic and then taping them inside\nthe rim of the toilet bowl. We encouraged our political comrades in the general section to be charged and placed in isolation so that they could\nretrieve these notes and send replies. The warders never bothered to search there.\nIn order not to have our notes read or understood by the authorities if they were found, we devised ways of writing that could not easily be seen or\ndeciphered. One way was to write messages with milk. The milk would dry almost immediately, and the paper would look blank. But the disinfectant\nwe were given to clean our cells, when sprayed on the dried milk, made the writing reappear. Unfortunately, we did not regularly receive milk. After\none of us was diagnosed with an ulcer, we used his.\nAnother technique was to write in tiny, coded script on toilet paper. The paper was so small and easily hidden that this became a popular way of\nsmuggling out messages. When the authorities discovered a number of these communications, they took the extraordinary measure of rationing\ntoilet paper. Govan was then ailing and not going to the quarry, and he was given the task of counting out eight squares of toilet paper for each\nprisoner per day.\nBut even with all these ingenious methods, one of the best ways was also the easiest: getting sent to the prison hospital. The island had one\nhospital, and it was difficult to segregate us from the general prisoners while we were there. Sometimes prisoners from the different sections even\nshared the same wards, and men from Section B and prisoners from F and G mingled and exchanged information about political organizations,\nstrikes, go-slows, whatever the current prison issues were.\nCommunication with the outside world was accomplished in two ways: through prisoners whose sentences were completed and who were\n\n\fleaving the island, and through contact with visitors. Prisoners who were leaving would smuggle out letters in their clothes or baggage. With outside\nvisitors, the situation was even more dangerous, because the risks were also borne by the visitor. When lawyers visited us, warders were not\npermitted in the room and we would sometimes pass a letter to the lawyer to be taken out. Lawyers were not searched. In these meetings, we could\nalso communicate by writing as we had during the Rivonia Trial. Because the room was bugged, we might say, \u201cPlease tell . . .\u201d and then pause and\nwrite \u201cO.T.,\u201d meaning Oliver Tambo, on a piece of paper, \u201cthat we approve of his plan to cut down the size of the . . .\u201d and then write, \u201cNational\nExecutive.\u201d\n\nThrough a plastic-wrapped note hidden in our food drums, we learned in July of  that the men in the general section had embarked on a\nhunger strike to protest poor conditions. The note was imprecise, and we did not know exactly when the strike had started or exactly what it was\nabout. But we would support any strike of prisoners for whatever reason they were striking. Word was passed among us, and we resolved to initiate\na sympathetic strike beginning with our next meal. A hunger strike consists of one thing: not eating.\nBecause of the time lag in communications, the general prisoners probably did not learn of our participation for a day or so. But we knew that the\nnews would hearten them. The authorities would be telling them that we were not participating in the strike, that we were gorging ourselves on\ngourmet meals. This was standard operating procedure; in a crisis, the authorities inevitably started a disinformation campaign to play one section\nagainst the other. In this case, while the ANC unanimously supported the strike, some PAC men in the general section did not.\nDuring the first day of our strike, we were served our normal rations and refused to take them. On the second day, we noticed that our portions\nwere larger and a few more vegetables accompanied our pap. On the third day, juicy pieces of meat were served with supper. By the fourth day,\nthe porridge was glistening with fat, and great hunks of meat and colorful vegetables were steaming on top. The food was positively mouthwatering.\nThe warders smiled when we passed up the food. The temptation was great, but we resisted, even though we were being driven especially hard at\nthe quarry. We heard that in the main section, prisoners were collapsing and being taken away in wheelbarrows.\nI was called to the Head Office for an interview with Colonel Wessels. Such sessions were delicate, as my fellow prisoners knew that the\nauthorities would attempt to influence me to call off the strike. Wessels was a direct man and demanded to know why we were on a hunger strike. I\nexplained that as political prisoners we saw protest to alter prison conditions as an extension of the anti-apartheid struggle. \u201cBut you don\u2019t even\nknow why they are striking in F and G,\u201d he said. I said that did not matter, that the men in F and G were our brothers and that our struggle was\nindivisible. He snorted, and dismissed me.\nThe following day we learned of an extraordinary course of events: the warders had gone on their own food boycott, refusing to go to their own\ncafeteria. They were not striking in support of us, but had decided that if we could do such a thing, why couldn\u2019t they? They were demanding better\nfood and improved living conditions. The combination of the two strikes was too much for the authorities. They settled with the warders and then, a\nday or two later, we learned the authorities had gone to the general section and asked for three representatives to negotiate changes. The general\nprisoners declared victory and called off the hunger strike. We followed suit a day later.\n* * *\nThat was the first and most successful of the hunger strikes on the island. As a form of protest, they did not have a high success rate and the\nrationale behind them always struck me as quixotic. In order for a hunger strike to succeed, the outside world must learn of it. Otherwise, prisoners\nwill simply starve themselves to death and no one will know. Smuggled-out information that we were on a hunger strike would elicit newspaper\nstories, which in turn would generate pressure from advocacy groups. The problem, particularly in the early years, was that it was next to impossible\nto alert people on the outside that we were waging a hunger strike inside.\nFor me, hunger strikes were altogether too passive. We who were already suffering were threatening our health, even courting death. I have\nalways favored a more active, militant style of protest such as work strikes, go-slow strikes, or refusing to clean up; actions that punished the\nauthorities, not ourselves. They wanted gravel and we produced no gravel. They wanted the prison yard clean and it was untidy. This kind of\nbehavior distressed and exasperated them, whereas I think they secretly enjoyed watching us go hungry.\nBut when it came to a decision, I was often outvoted. My colleagues even jokingly accused me of not wanting to miss a meal. The proponents of\nhunger strikes argued that it was a traditionally accepted form of protest that had been waged all over the world by such prominent leaders as\nMahatma Gandhi. Once the decision was taken, however, I would support it as wholeheartedly as any of its advocates. In fact, during the strikes I\nwas often in the position of remonstrating with some of my more wayward colleagues who did not want to abide by our agreement. \u201cMadiba, I want\nmy food,\u201d I remember one man saying. \u201cI don\u2019t see why I should go without. I have served the struggle for many years.\u201d\nComrades would sometimes eat on the sly. We knew this for a simple reason: by the second day of a hunger strike, no one needs to use the\ntoilet. Yet one morning you might see a fellow going to the toilet. We had our own internal intelligence service because we knew that certain men\nwere weak in this regard.\n IN THE MIDST of the July  hunger strike I had my second visit from my wife. It was almost exactly two years after the first visit, and it nearly did\nnot happen at all. Winnie had been under constant harassment since her first visit in . Her sisters and brother were persecuted by the police,\nand the authorities attempted to forbid anyone in her family from living with her. Some of this I learned at the time, much of it I found out later. Some\nof the nastiest items were known to me because when I would return from the quarry, I often would find neatly cut clippings about Winnie that had\nbeen anonymously placed on my bed by the warders.\nIn small and spiteful ways, the authorities did their best to make Winnie\u2019s journeys as unpleasant as possible. For the previous two years, her\nvisits had been stymied by local magistrates and by the repeated bannings that prevented her from traveling. I had recently heard through counsel\nthat Winnie had been informed by the police that she could visit me only if she carried a pass. Winnie, who had been protesting the government\u2019s\npolicy regarding women\u2019s passes since the s, rightly refused to carry the hated document. The authorities were clearly attempting to humiliate\nher and me. But I thought it was more important that we see each other than to resist the petty machinations of the authorities, and Winnie\nconsented to carry a pass. I missed her enormously and needed the reassurance of seeing her, and we also had vital family matters to discuss.\nThe regulations governing each of Winnie\u2019s visits were long and complicated. She was barred from taking a train or car and had to fly, making\nthe trip much more expensive. She was required to take the shortest route from the airport to Caledon Square, the Cape Town police station,\nwhere she was required to sign various documents. She had to report to the same station on the way back and sign more documents.\nI had also learned from a newspaper clipping that a Special Branch officer broke into our Orlando house while Winnie was dressing and she\nreacted angrily, pushing the officer out of the bedroom. The lieutenant laid a charge of assault against her, and I asked my friend and colleague\nGeorge Bizos to defend her, which he ably did. We had seen stories about this in the newspapers, and some of the men even joked with me about\nWinnie\u2019s bellicosity. \u201cYou are not the only boxer in the family, Madiba,\u201d they said.\nThis second visit was for only half an hour, and we had much to discuss. Winnie was a bit agitated from the rough treatment in Cape Town and\nthe fact that, as always, she had to ride in the hold of the ferry where the fumes from the engine made her ill. She had taken pains to dress up for\nme, but she looked thin and drawn.\nWe reviewed the education of the children, the health of my mother, which was not very good, and our finances. A critical issue was the education\nof Zeni and Zindzi. Winnie had placed the girls in a school designated as Indian, and the authorities were harassing the principal on the grounds\nthat it was a violation of the law for the school to accept African pupils. We made the difficult decision to send Zeni and Zindzi to boarding school in\nSwaziland. This was hard on Winnie, who found her greatest sustenance in the two girls. I was consoled by the fact that their education would\nprobably be superior there, but I worried about Winnie. She would be lonely and prey for people who sought to undermine her under the guise of\nbeing her friends. If anything, Winnie was too trusting of people\u2019s motives.\nTo get around the restrictions on discussing nonfamily matters, we used names whose meaning was clear to us, but not to the warders. If I\nwanted to know how Winnie was really doing, I might say, \u201cHave you heard about Ngutyana recently; is she all right?\u201d Ngutyana is one of Winnie\u2019s\nclan names, but the authorities were unaware of that. Then Winnie could talk about how and what Ngutyana was doing. If the warder asked who\nNgutyana was, we would say she was a cousin. If I wanted to know about how the external mission of the ANC was faring, I would ask, \u201cHow is the\nchurch?\u201d Winnie would discuss \u201cthe church\u201d in appropriate terms, and I might then ask, \u201cHow are the priests? Are there any new sermons?\u201d We\nimprovised and managed to exchange a great deal of information that way.\nAs always, when the warder yelled, \u201cTime up!,\u201d I thought only a few minutes had passed. I wanted to kiss the glass good-bye, but restrained\nmyself. I always preferred for Winnie to leave first so she would not have to see me led away by the warders, and I watched as she whispered a\ngood-bye, hiding her pain from the warders.\nAfter the visit, I replayed all the details in my mind, what Winnie wore, what she said, what I said. I then wrote her a letter going over some of what\nwe had discussed, and reminding her of how much I cared for her, how unshakable our bond was, how courageous she was. I saw my letters to her\nboth as love letters and as the only way I could give her the emotional support she needed.\nSoon after the visit, I learned that Winnie had been charged for failing to report to the police on her arrival in Cape Town as well as refusing to\nfurnish the police with her address when she left. Having already given her address at the ferry, she was asked again when she returned, and\nrefused, saying she had done so earlier.\nWinnie was arrested and released on bail. She was tried and sentenced to a year\u2019s imprisonment, which was suspended except for four days.\nWinnie was subsequently dismissed from her second job as a social worker because of the incident, and lost her main source of income.\n\nThe state did its utmost to harass me in ways they thought I would be powerless to resist. Toward the end of , the Transvaal Law Society, at\nthe instigation of the minister of justice, made a motion to strike me off the roll of practicing attorneys as a result of my conviction in the Rivonia\nTrial. Apparently they were not discouraged by the earlier unsuccessful attempt to remove my name from the roll because of my conviction in the\nDefiance Campaign.\nI found out about the Law Society\u2019s action only after it had been initiated. The Transvaal Law Society was an extremely conservative organization,\nand they were seeking to punish me at a time when they assumed I would be unable to defend myself. It is not easy for a prisoner on Robben Island\nto defend himself in court, but that is precisely what I intended to do.\nI informed the authorities that I planned to contest the action and would prepare my own defense. I told prison officials that in order to prepare\nadequately, I would need to be exempt from going to the quarry and would also require a proper table, chair, and reading light to work on my brief. I\nsaid I needed access to a law library and demanded to be taken to Pretoria.\nMy strategy was to overwhelm the prison authorities and the courts with legitimate requests, which I knew they would have a difficult time\nsatisfying. The authorities always found it distressing when I wanted to defend myself in court because the accompanying publicity would show that I\nwas still fighting for the same values I always had.\nTheir first response was, \u201cMandela, why don\u2019t you retain a lawyer to defend you? He will be able to handle the case properly. Why put yourself\nout?\u201d I went ahead and applied to the registrar of the Supreme Court for the records, documents, and books that I would need. I also requested a\nlist of the state\u2019s witnesses and summaries of their prospective testimony.\nI received a letter stating that before the court would grant my requests they would need to know the nature of my defense. This was extraordinary.\nTo ask the nature of a lawyer\u2019s defense before the trial? No defendant can be compelled to reveal his defense before he is actually in court. I wrote\nback to tell them that the nature of my defense would become clear to them when I filed my papers \u2014 and not until then.\nThis was the beginning of a flurry of correspondence between me and the registrar as well as the state attorney, who was representing the Law\n\n\fSociety. I would not back down on any of my requests. The authorities were equally intransigent: I could not be taken off quarry detail, I could not\nhave a table and chair, and under no circumstances would I be able to go to Pretoria to use the law library.\nI continued to bedevil the Law Society and registrar with demands, which they continued to deflect. Finally, several months and many letters later,\nwithout any fanfare and with just a cursory notification to me, they dropped the entire matter. The case was becoming more than they had bargained\nfor. They had reckoned I would not have the initiative or wherewithal to defend myself; they were mistaken.\n\nI was able to read in detail about the official reactions to my opposition to the Law Society\u2019s actions because we were receiving a daily newspaper\njust as if it were delivered to our door. In effect, it was.\nThe warder who supervised us at night was a quiet, elderly Jehovah\u2019s Witness whom Mac Maharaj had befriended. One night, he wandered over\nto Mac\u2019s cell and told him that he wanted to enter a newspaper contest that required an essay. Would Mac, he wondered, be willing to assist him in\nwriting it? The old warder hinted that if Mac helped him, there would be a reward. Mac agreed, and duly wrote the essay. A fortnight later, the old\nman came to Mac very excited. He was now a finalist in the competition; would Mac write him another essay? The warder promised Mac a cooked\nchicken in return. Mac told the old warder that he would think about it.\nThe next day, Mac came to Walter and me and explained the situation. While Walter encouraged Mac to accept the food, I appreciated his\nreluctance to do so, because it would appear that he was getting special treatment. That night, he told the warder he would write the essay in\nexchange for a pack of cigarettes. The old warder agreed, and the following evening presented Mac with a newly bought pack of cigarettes.\nThe next day, Mac told us that he now had the leverage he wanted over the old warder. How? we asked. \u201cBecause I have his fingerprints on the\ncigarette pack,\u201d Mac said, \u201cand I can blackmail him.\u201d Walter exclaimed that that was immoral. I did not criticize Mac, but asked what he would\nblackmail him for. Mac raised his eyebrow: \u201cNewspapers,\u201d he said. Walter and I looked at each other. I think Walter was the only man on Robben\nIsland who relished newspapers as much as I did. Mac had already discussed his plan with the communications committee, and although we both\nhad reservations about Mac\u2019s technique, we did not stop him.\nThat night Mac told the warder that he had his fingerprints on the pack of cigarettes and that if the old man did not cooperate, he would expose\nhim to the commanding officer. Terrified of being fired and losing his pension, the warder agreed to do whatever Mac wanted. For the next six\nmonths, until the warder was transferred, the old man would smuggle that day\u2019s newspaper to Mac. Mac would then summarize the news and\nreduce it to a single small piece of paper, which would circulate among us. The unfortunate warder did not win the contest, either.\n\nIt would be hard to say what we did more of at the quarry: mine lime or talk. By , the warders had adopted a laissez-faire attitude: we could talk\nas much as we wanted as long as we worked. We would cluster in small groups, four or five men in a rough circle, and talk all day long, about every\nsubject under the sun. We were in a perpetual conversation with each other on topics both solemn and trifling.\nThere is no prospect about prison which pleases \u2014 with the possible exception of one. One has time to think. In the vortex of the struggle, when\none is constantly reacting to changing circumstances, one rarely has the chance to carefully consider all the ramifications of one\u2019s decisions or\npolicies. Prison provided the time \u2014 much more than enough time \u2014 to reflect on what one had done and not done.\nWe were constantly engaged in political debates. Some were dispatched in a day, others were disputed for years. I have always enjoyed the cutand-thrust of debating, and was a ready participant. One of our earliest and longest debates concerned the relationship between the ANC and the\nCommunist Party. Some of the men, especially those MK soldiers who had been trained in socialist countries, believed that the ANC and the party\nwere one and the same. Even some very senior ANC colleagues, such as Govan Mbeki and Harry Gwala, subscribed to this theory.\nThe party did not exist as a separate entity on Robben Island. In prison, there was no point in making the distinction between the ANC and the\nparty that existed on the outside. My own views on the subject had not altered in many years. The ANC was a mass liberation movement that\nwelcomed all those with the same objectives.\nOver time, the debate concerning the ANC and the party grew progressively acrimonious. A number of us proposed one way to resolve it: we\nwould write to the ANC in exile in Lusaka. We prepared a secret twenty-two-page document on the subject with a covering letter from myself to be\nsent to Lusaka. It was a risky maneuver to prepare and smuggle out such a document. In the end, Lusaka confirmed the separation of the ANC and\nthe party and the argument eventually withered away.\nAnother recurrent political discussion was whether or not the ANC leadership should come exclusively from the working class. Some argued that\nbecause the ANC was a mass organization made up mainly of ordinary workers, the leadership should come from those same ranks. My argument\nwas that it was as undemocratic to specify that the leaders had to be from the working class as to declare that they should be bourgeois\nintellectuals. If the movement had insisted on such a rule, most of its leaders, men such as Chief Luthuli, Moses Kotane, Dr. Dadoo, would have\nbeen ineligible. Revolutionaries are drawn from every class.\n\nNot all debates were political. One issue that provoked much discussion was circumcision. Some among us maintained that circumcision as\npracticed by the Xhosa and other tribes was not only an unnecessary mutilation of the body, but a reversion to the type of tribalism that the ANC\nwas seeking to overthrow. It was not an unreasonable argument, but the prevailing view, with which I agreed, was that circumcision was a cultural\nritual that had not only a salutary health benefit but an important psychological effect. It was a rite that strengthened group identification and\ninculcated positive values.\nThe debate continued for years, and a number of men voted in favor of circumcision in a very direct way. A prisoner working in the hospital who\nhad formerly practiced as an ingcibi set up a secret circumcision school, and a number of the younger prisoners from our section were circumcised\nthere. Afterward, we would organize a small party of tea and biscuits for the men, and they would spend a day or two walking around in blankets, as\nwas the custom.\n\nOne subject we hearkened back to again and again was the question of whether there were tigers in Africa. Some argued that although it was\npopularly assumed that tigers lived in Africa, this was a myth and they were native to Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Africa had leopards in\nabundance, but no tigers. The other side argued that tigers were native to Africa and some still lived there. Some claimed to have seen with their\nown eyes this most powerful and beautiful of cats in the jungles of Africa.\n\n\fI maintained that while there were no tigers to be found in contemporary Africa, there was a Xhosa word for tiger, a word different from the one\nfor leopard, and that if the word existed in our language, the creature must have once existed in Africa. Otherwise, why would there be a name for\nit? This argument went round and round, and I remember Mac retorting that hundreds of years ago there was a Hindi word for a craft that flew in the\nair, long before the airplane was invented, but that did not mean that airplanes existed in ancient India. \u201cZITHULELE,\u201d the Quiet One, was what we called the tolerant, soft-spoken warder in charge of us at the quarry. He routinely stood a great distance\nfrom us while we worked and did not appear to care what we did as long as we were orderly. He never berated us when he found us leaning on our\nspades and talking.\nWe responded in kind. One day, in , he came to us and said, \u201cGentlemen, the rains have washed away the lines on the roads, we need\ntwenty kilos of lime today. Can you help?\u201d Although we were working very little at the time, he had approached us as human beings, and we agreed\nto assist him.\nThat spring, we had felt a certain thawing on the part of the authorities, a relaxation of the iron-fisted discipline that had prevailed on the island.\nThe tension between prisoners and warders had lessened somewhat.\nBut this lull proved to be short-lived and came to an abrupt end one morning in September. We had just put down our picks and shovels on the\nquarry face and were walking to the shed for lunch. As one of the general prisoners wheeled a drum of food toward us, he whispered, \u201cVerwoerd is\ndead.\u201d That was all. The news quickly passed among us. We looked at each other in disbelief and glanced over at the warders, who seemed\nunaware that anything momentous had occurred.\n\nWe did not know how the prime minister had died. Later, we heard about the obscure white parliamentary messenger who stabbed Verwoerd to\ndeath, and we wondered at his motives. Although Verwoerd thought Africans were beneath animals, his death did not yield us any pleasure.\nPolitical assassination is not something I or the ANC has ever supported. It is a primitive way of contending with an opponent.\nVerwoerd had proved to be both the chief theorist and master builder of grand apartheid. He had championed the creation of the bantustans and\nBantu Education. Shortly before his death he had led the Nationalists in the general election of , in which the party of apartheid had increased\nits majority, winning  seats to the  achieved by the United Party, and the single seat won by the Progressive Party.\nAs often happened on the island, we had learned significant political news before our own guards. But by the following day, it was obvious the\nwarders knew, for they took out their anger on us. The tension that had taken months to abate was suddenly at full force. The authorities began a\ncrackdown against political prisoners as though we had held the knife that stabbed Verwoerd.\nThe authorities always imagined that we were secretly linked with all kinds of powerful forces on the outside. The spate of successful guerrilla\nattacks against the South African police forces in Namibia by the South-West African People\u2019s Organization (SWAPO) \u2014 an ally of the ANC \u2014\nhad also unnerved them. I suppose we should have been flattered that the government thought our nascent military ability was sophisticated enough\nto successfully eliminate their head of state. But their suspicions merely reflected the insecurities of narrow, shortsighted men who blamed their\nproblems not on their own misguided policies but on an opponent by the name of the ANC.\nThe punishment against us was never enunciated as an official policy, but it was a renewal of the harsh atmosphere that prevailed upon our\narrival on the island. The Quiet One was replaced with a man who was a vicious martinet. His name was Van Rensburg and he had been flown to\nthe island on twenty-four hours\u2019 notice after the assassination. His reputation preceded him, for his name was a byword among prisoners for\nbrutality.\nVan Rensburg was a big, clumsy, brutish fellow who did not speak but shouted. During his first day on the job we noticed he had a small swastika\ntattooed on his wrist. But he did not need this offensive symbol to prove his cruelty. His job was to make our lives as wretched as possible, and he\npursued that goal with great enthusiasm.\n\nEach day over the next few months, Van Rensburg would charge one of us for insubordination or malingering. Each morning, he and the other\nwarders would discuss who would be charged that afternoon. It was a policy of selective intimidation, and the decision on who would be charged\nwas taken regardless of how hard that prisoner had worked that day. When we were trudging back to our cells, Van Rensburg would read from a\nlist, \u201cMandela [or Sisulu or Kathrada], I want to see you immediately in front of the head of prison.\u201d\nThe island\u2019s administrative court began working overtime. In response, we formed our own legal committee made up of myself, Fikile Bam, and\nMac Maharaj. Mac had studied law and was adept at putting the authorities on the defensive. Fiks, who was working toward a law degree, was a\nbright, resourceful fellow who had become the head of the prisoners\u2019 committee in our section. The job of our legal committee was to advise our\ncomrades on how to conduct themselves in the island\u2019s administrative court.\nVan Rensburg was not a clever fellow, and while he would lord it over us at the quarry, we could outwit him in court. Our strategy was not to argue\nwith him in the field, but to contest the charges in court where we would have a chance to make our case before slightly more enlightened officers. In\nadministrative court, the charge would be read by the presiding magistrate. \u201cMalingering at the quarry,\u201d he might say, at which Van Rensburg would\nlook smug. After the charge had been read in full, I always advised my colleagues to do one thing and one thing only: ask the court for \u201cfurther\nparticulars.\u201d This was one\u2019s right as a defendant, and though the request became a regular occurrence, Van Rensburg would almost always be\nstumped. Court would then have to be adjourned while Van Rensburg went out to gather \u201cfurther particulars.\u201d\n\nVan Rensburg was vindictive in large ways and small. When our lunch arrived at the quarry and we would sit down to eat \u2014 we now had a simple\nwooden table \u2014 Van Rensburg would inevitably choose that moment to urinate next to our food. I suppose we should have been grateful that he did\nnot urinate directly on our food, but we lodged a protest against the practice anyway.\nOne of the few ways prisoners can take revenge on warders is through humor, and Van Rensburg became the butt of many of our jokes. Among\nourselves we called him \u201cSuitcase.\u201d Warders\u2019 lunch boxes were known as \u201csuitcases\u201d and normally a warder would designate a prisoner, usually his\nfavorite, to carry his \u201csuitcase,\u201d and then reward him with half a sandwich. But we always refused to carry Van Rensburg\u2019s \u201csuitcase,\u201d hence the\nnickname. It was humiliating for a warder to carry his own lunch pail.\nOne day, Wilton Mkwayi inadvertently referred to \u201cSuitcase\u201d within Van Rensburg\u2019s hearing. \u201cWho is Suitcase?\u201d Van Rensburg bellowed. Wilton\npaused for a moment and then blurted out, \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you call me Suitcase?\u201d Van Rensburg asked. Wilton paused. \u201cCome, man,\u201d Van Rensburg said. \u201cBecause you carry your own\n\u2018suitcase,\u2019 \u201d Wilton replied tentatively. \u201cThe general prisoners carry the \u2018suitcases\u2019 of their warders, but we won\u2019t carry yours \u2014 so we call you\nSuitcase.\u201d\n\n\fVan Rensburg considered this for a moment, and instead of getting angry, announced, \u201cMy name is not Suitcase, it\u2019s Dik Nek.\u201d There was\nsilence for a moment, and then all of us burst into laughter. In Afrikaans, Dik Nek literally means \u201cThick Neck\u201d; it suggests someone who is stubborn\nand unyielding. Suitcase, I suspect, was too thick to know that he had been insulted.\n\nOne day at the quarry, we resumed our discussion of whether or not the tiger was native to Africa. We were not able to talk as freely during Van\nRensburg\u2019s tenure as we had been before, but we were able to talk nonetheless while we worked.\nThe principal advocate of those who argued that the tiger was not native to Africa was Andrew Masondo, an ANC leader from the Cape who had\nalso been a lecturer at Fort Hare. Masondo could be a volatile fellow, and he was vehement in his assertions that no tigers had ever been found in\nAfrica. The argument was going back and forth and the men had put down their picks and shovels in the heat of the argument. This attracted the\nattention of the warders, and they shouted at us to get back to work. But we were so absorbed in the argument that we ignored the warders. A few\nof the lower-ranking warders ordered us to go back to work, but we paid them no attention. Finally, Suitcase marched over and bellowed at us in\nEnglish, a language in which he was not expert: \u201cYou talk too much, but you work too few!\u201d\nThe men now did not pick up their tools because they were bent over in laughter. Suitcase\u2019s grammatical mistake struck everyone as extremely\ncomical. But Suitcase was not at all amused. He immediately sent for Major Kellerman, the commanding officer.\nKellerman arrived on the scene a few minutes later to find us in much the same state as we had been before. Kellerman was relatively new to the\nisland, and was determined to set the right tone. One of the warders then reported to Kellerman that Andrew Masondo and I had not been working,\nand we were to be charged with malingering and insubordination. Under Kellerman\u2019s authority, we were then handcuffed and taken to isolation.\n\nFrom that point on, Suitcase seemed to hold a special grudge against me. One day, while he was supervising us at the quarry, I was working next\nto Fikile Bam. We were off by ourselves, on the far side of the quarry. We worked diligently, but since we were both studying law at the time, we\nwere discussing what we had read the night before. At the end of the day, Van Rensburg stood in front of us and said, \u201cFikile Bam and Nelson\nMandela, I want to see you in front of the head of prison.\u201d\nWe were brought before the lieutenant, who was the head of prison, and Van Rensburg announced, \u201cThese men did not work the whole day. I\u2019m\ncharging them for defying orders.\u201d The lieutenant asked if we had anything to say. \u201cLieutenant,\u201d I responded, \u201cwe dispute the charge. We have been\nworking and, in fact, we have evidence that we have been working, and it is essential to our defense.\u201d The lieutenant scoffed at this. \u201cAll you men\nwork in the same area,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is it possible to have evidence?\u201d I explained that Fiks and I had been working apart from the others and that\nwe could show exactly how much work we had done. Suitcase naively confirmed that we had been off by ourselves, and the lieutenant agreed to\nhave a look. We drove back to the quarry.\nOnce there, Fiks and I walked to the area where we had been working. I pointed to the considerable pile of rocks and lime that we had built up\nand said, \u201cThere, that is what we have done today.\u201d Suitcase had never even bothered to examine our work and was rattled by the quantity of it.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said to the lieutenant, \u201cthat is the result of a week\u2019s work.\u201d The lieutenant was skeptical. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d he said to Suitcase, \u201cshow me the\nsmall pile that Mandela and Bam put together today.\u201d Suitcase had no reply, and the lieutenant did something I have rarely seen a superior officer\ndo: he chastised his subordinate in the presence of prisoners. \u201cYou are telling lies,\u201d he said, and dismissed the charges on the spot.\n\nOne morning in early , during Suitcase\u2019s tenure, we were preparing to walk to the quarry when Suitcase informed us that an order had come\ndown from Major Kellerman forbidding us to talk. Not only was conversation banned on our walks; henceforth, there would be no conversation\npermitted at the quarry. \u201cFrom now on, silence!\u201d he yelled.\nThis command was greeted by profound dismay and outrage. Talking and discussing issues were the only things that made the work at the\nquarry tolerable. Of course, we could not discuss it on the way to the quarry because we were ordered not to talk, but during our lunch break the\nANC leadership and the heads of the other political groups managed secretly to hash out a plan.\nWhile we were surreptitiously hatching our plan, Major Kellerman himself appeared and walked into our lunch shed. This was highly unusual; we\nhad never had such a high-ranking visitor in our lowly shed. With a cough of embarrassment, he announced that his order had been a mistake and\nthat we could resume talking at the quarry, just as long as we did it quietly. He then told us to carry on and spun on his heel and was gone. We were\nglad the order was rescinded, but suspicious as to why.\nFor the remainder of the day, we were not forced to work very hard. Suitcase did his best to be friendly, and said that as a gesture of goodwill he\nhad decided to withdraw all pending charges against us.\nThat afternoon, I discovered that my cell had been moved from number , near the entrance of the passageway, to number , at the back. All of\nmy belongings had been dumped into the new cell. As always, there was no explanation.\nWe guessed that we were to have a visitor and I had been moved because the authorities did not want me to be the first among the prisoners to\ntalk to whoever was coming. If each prisoner in turn voiced his complaints, the authorities could yell \u201cTime up!\u201d before a visitor reached cell . We\nresolved that in the interest of unity, each individual along the passageway would inform any visitor that while everyone had individual complaints,\nthe prisoner in number  would speak for all.\nThe following morning, after breakfast, we were informed by Suitcase that we would not be going to the quarry. Then Major Kellerman appeared\nto say that Mrs. Helen Suzman, the lone member of the liberal Progressive Party in Parliament and the only voice of true opposition to the\nNationalists in Parliament, would be arriving shortly. In less than fifteen minutes, Mrs. Suzman \u2014 all five feet two inches of her \u2014 came through the\ndoor of our passageway, accompanied by General Steyn, the commissioner of prisons. As she was introduced to each prisoner, she asked him\nwhether or not he had any complaints. Each man replied the same way: \u201cI have many complaints, but our spokesman is Mr. Nelson Mandela at the\nend of the corridor.\u201d To General Steyn\u2019s dismay, Mrs. Suzman was soon at my cell. She firmly shook my hand and cordially introduced herself.\nUnlike judges and magistrates, who were automatically permitted access to prisons, members of Parliament had to request permission to visit a\nprison. Mrs. Suzman was one of the few, if not the only, members of Parliament who took an interest in the plight of political prisoners. Many stories\nwere circulating about Robben Island, and Mrs. Suzman had come to investigate for herself.\nAs this was Mrs. Suzman\u2019s first visit to Robben Island, I attempted to put her at ease. But she was remarkably confident and utterly unfazed by her\nsurroundings, and proposed that we get down to business right away. General Steyn and the commanding officer stood by her, but I did not mince\nwords. I told her of our desire to have the food improved and equalized and to have better clothing; the need for facilities for studying; our right to\ninformation such as newspapers; and many more things. I told her of the harshness of the warders, and mentioned Van Rensburg in particular. I\n\n\fpointed out that he had a swastika tattooed on his forearm. Helen reacted like a lawyer. \u201cWell, Mr. Mandela,\u201d she said, \u201cwe must not take that too far\nbecause we don\u2019t know when it was made. Perhaps, for example, his parents had it tattooed on him?\u201d I assured her that was not the case.\nNormally, I would not complain about an individual warder. One learns in prison that it is better to fight for general principles than to battle each\nindividual case. However callous a warder may be, he is usually just carrying out prison policy. But Van Rensburg was in a class by himself, and we\nbelieved that if he were gone, it would make a disproportionate difference for all of us.\nMrs. Suzman listened attentively, jotting down what I said in a small notebook, and promised to take these matters up with the minister of justice.\nShe then made an inspection of our cells, and talked a bit with some of the other men. It was an odd and wonderful sight to see this courageous\nwoman peering into our cells and strolling around our courtyard. She was the first and only woman ever to grace our cells.\nVan Rensburg was exceedingly nervous during Mrs. Suzman\u2019s visit. According to Kathy, while Mrs. Suzman and I were talking, Van Rensburg\napologized for all his past actions. But his contrition did not last long, for the next day he informed us he was reinstating all the charges against us.\nWe later learned that Mrs. Suzman had taken up our case in Parliament, and within a few weeks of her visit, Suitcase was transferred off the island.\n",
    "1967-1973": " I NEVER IMAGINED the struggle would be either short or easy. The first few years on the island were difficult times both for the organization\noutside and those of us in prison. After Rivonia, much of the movement\u2019s underground machinery had been destroyed. Our structures had been\ndiscovered and uprooted; those who were not captured were scrambling to stay one step ahead of the enemy. Virtually every one of the ANC\u2019s\nsenior leaders was either in jail or in exile.\nIn the years after Rivonia, the ANC\u2019s External Mission, formerly responsible for fund-raising, diplomacy, and establishing a military training\nprogram, took up the reins of the organization as a whole. The External Mission not only had to create an organization in exile, but had the even\nmore formidable task of trying to revitalize the underground ANC inside South Africa.\nThe state had grown stronger. The police had become more powerful, their methods more ruthless, their techniques more sophisticated. The\nSouth African Defense Force was expanding. The economy was stable, the white electorate untroubled. The South African government had\npowerful allies in Great Britain and the United States who were content to maintain the status quo.\nBut elsewhere the struggle against imperialism was on the march. In the middle to late s, armed struggles were being fought throughout\nsouthern Africa. In Namibia (then South-West Africa), SWAPO was making its first incursions in the Caprivi Strip; in Mozambique and Angola, the\nguerrilla movement was growing and spreading. In Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia), the battle against white minority rule was advancing. Ian Smith\u2019s\nwhite government was bolstered by the South African Defense Force, and the ANC regarded the battle in Zimbabwe as an extension of our\nstruggle at home. In , we learned that the ANC had forged an alliance with the Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union (ZAPU), which had been\nformed by Joshua Nkomo.\nThat year, a group of MK soldiers who had been training in Tanzania and Zambia crossed the Zambezi River into Rhodesia with the intention of\nmaking their way home. This first group of MK soldiers was christened the Luthuli Detachment and they were the spearhead of the armed struggle.\nIn August, as the Luthuli Detachment, accompanied by ZAPU troops, moved southward, they were spotted by the Rhodesian army. Over the next\nfew weeks, fierce battles were fought and both sides sustained casualties. Finally, our troops were overpowered by the superior numbers of the\nRhodesian forces. Some were captured, and others retreated into Bechuanaland \u2014 which had become independent Botswana. By the beginning\nof , another larger ANC detachment had entered Rhodesia and fought not only the Rhodesian army but South African policemen who had\nbeen posted to Rhodesia.\nWe heard of this months later by rumor, but did not learn the full story until some of the men who had fought there were imprisoned with us.\nThough our forces were not victorious, we quietly celebrated the fact that our MK cadres had engaged the enemy in combat on their own terms. It\nwas a milestone in the struggle. \u201cJustice\u201d Panza, one of the commanders of the Luthuli Detachment, was later imprisoned with us. He briefed us on\nthe detachment\u2019s military training, political education, and valor in the field. As a former commander-in-chief of MK, I was terribly proud of our\nsoldiers.\n* * *\nBefore receiving the news of MK\u2019s battles abroad, we also learned of Chief Luthuli\u2019s death at home in July . The circumstances were curious:\nhe had been hit by a train in an area near his farm where he often walked. I was granted permission to write a letter to his widow. Luthuli\u2019s death left\na great vacuum in the organization; the chief was a Nobel Prize winner, a distinguished, internationally known figure, a man who commanded\nrespect from both black and white. For these reasons, he was irreplaceable. Yet in Oliver Tambo, who was acting president-general of the ANC,\nthe organization found a man who could fill the chief\u2019s shoes. Like Luthuli, he was articulate yet not showy, confident but humble. He too epitomized\nChief Luthuli\u2019s precept: \u201cLet your courage rise with danger.\u201d\nWe organized a small memorial service for the chief in Section B and permitted everyone who wanted to speak to do so. It was a quiet,\nrespectful service, with only one sour note. When Neville Alexander of the Unity Movement rose to speak, it was apparent that he had come not to\npraise the chief but to bury him. Without even perfunctory regrets at the man\u2019s passing, he accused Luthuli of being a patsy of the white man, mainly\non the grounds that the chief had accepted the Nobel Peace Prize.\nApart from its wrong-headedness, Neville\u2019s speech was entirely contrary to the climate of cooperation between organizations we were trying to\ncreate on the island. From the moment I arrived on the island, I had made it my mission to seek some accommodation with our rivals in the\nstruggle. I saw Robben Island as an opportunity to patch up the long and often bitter differences between the PAC and the ANC. If we could unite\nthe two organizations on the island, that could set a precedent for uniting them in the liberation struggle as a whole.\nYet from the beginning, relations with the PAC had been more competitive than cooperative. Some of the PAC men had already been on the\nisland, and saw our arrival as an encroachment on their territory. We heard from some of our men that the most senior PAC prisoners had\nexpressed regret that we had not been hanged.\nIn , when I had first been on the island, the PAC had greatly outnumbered the ANC. In , the numbers were reversed. Yet this seemed to\nharden the PAC in their positions. They were unashamedly anti-Communist and anti-Indian. In the early years, I had talks with Zeph Mothopeng, who\nhad been on the PAC\u2019s National Executive Committee. Zeph argued that the PAC was more militant than the ANC, and that in prison, the ANC\nshould follow the PAC\u2019s lead. The PAC maintained that negotiations with the authorities were a betrayal, but that did not stop them from taking\nadvantage of the benefits that resulted from negotiations. In , I held talks with Selby Ngendane on the question of unity. Outside of prison,\nNgendane had been violently opposed to the Freedom Charter, but in prison, particularly when sent to our section, Selby mellowed. We eventually\nwrote separate letters to our respective organizations in the general section advocating the idea of unity. The ANC also worked well with Clarence\nMakwetu, who later became president of the PAC. Makwetu, who had once been a member of the ANC Youth League, was in our section and was\na balanced, sensible man. We had many fruitful discussions about the unity of our two organizations, but after Makwetu was released and was\nsucceeded in the PAC leadership on Robben Island by John Pokela, the talks foundered.\nThe PAC\u2019s insecurity occasionally had comical results. At one point, an order came from Pretoria that I was to be isolated from all other\nprisoners at the quarry. I would work separately, eat separately, and have my own guard. We noticed that this new ruling caused some agitation\namong the PAC. Several days later, the PAC decided that their leader, Zeph Mothopeng, would also be isolated, and on their own they had him\nwork and eat separately from everyone else for as long as I did.\nThe PAC often refused to participate in meetings that had no overt party affiliation. When we called meetings to discuss our grievances and later\nhad news sessions to discuss what we had learned from the paper, the PAC boycotted these gatherings. I found this greatly annoying. The PAC,\nwe learned, were ignorant of changes in their own organization on the outside. At the time, the PAC members on the island refused to believe our\nclaims that the exiled PAC had opened its doors to whites and Indians as members. That was heresy. Yet we had read in the paper that the white\nactivist Patrick Duncan had become a member of the PAC executive. The PAC members derided this at the time as ANC propaganda.\n\n\f* * *\nThe ANC formed its own internal organization on the island. Known as the High Command, or more officially, the High Organ, it consisted of the\nmost senior ANC leaders on Robben Island, the men who had been members of the National Executive Committee: Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki,\nRaymond Mhlaba, and myself. I served as the head of the High Organ.\nFrom its inception, we decided the High Organ would not try to influence external ANC policy. We had no reliable way of evaluating the situation\nin the country, and concluded it would neither be fair nor wise for us to offer guidance on matters about which we were uninformed. Instead, we\nmade decisions about such matters as prisoners\u2019 complaints, strikes, mail, food \u2014 all of the day-to-day concerns of prison life. We would, when\npossible, convene a general members\u2019 meeting, which we regarded as vital to the health of our organization. But as these meetings were extremely\ndangerous and thus infrequent, the High Organ would often take decisions that were then communicated to all the other members. The High Organ\nalso operated a cell system, with each cell consisting of three members.\nIn the first few years on the island, the High Organ also acted as a representative committee for all the political prisoners in our section. In ,\nwe organized a petition demanding better treatment that was signed by virtually everyone, including members of the PAC, the Unity Movement, and\nthe Liberal Party, represented by Eddie Daniels. This arrangement was acceptable to all until Neville Alexander complained that the High Organ\nwas neither democratic nor truly representative, and that some other body ought to be created.\nNeville\u2019s original suggestion eventually turned into a prisoners\u2019 committee composed of people from all political parties. There was fear among\nthe other organizations that the ANC would attempt to dominate it, and the committee\u2019s rules were crafted so that its powers were purely\nconsultative and its decisions not binding. Even so, it was still difficult to agree on a common approach to problems. We suggested that Fikile\nBam, a member of the Yu Chi Chan Club, preside over meetings. Later, the committee leadership would rotate. Eventually the committee became\nknown as Ulundi, and acted as a disciplinary committee for all political prisoners.\nThe High Organ was the source of some controversy because of its ethnic composition: all four permanent members were from Xhosa\nbackgrounds. This was a matter of coincidence rather than design; the senior ANC leadership on the island, the only four to have served on the\nNational Executive Committee, happened to be Xhosa. It would not have been proper to take a less senior comrade and put him on the High Organ\nsimply because he was not a Xhosa. But the fact that the High Organ was Xhosa-dominated disturbed me because it seemed to reinforce the\nmistaken perception that we were a Xhosa organization.\nI have always found this criticism to be vexing and based on both ignorance of ANC history and maliciousness. I would refute it by noting that the\npresidents of the ANC have been Zulus, Basotho, Pedis, and Tswanas, and the executive has always been a mixture of tribal groups. I recall once\nworking in our courtyard on a sunny afternoon, while some men from the general section were working on the roof above me. They shouted at me,\n\u201cMdala! [Old man!], why do you only talk to Xhosas?\u201d The accusation stung me. I looked up and said, \u201cHow can you accuse me of discrimination?\nWe are one people.\u201d They seemed satisfied by that, but their perception stuck in my mind. From then on, whenever I knew I would be walking in\nfront of men from the general section, I would try to converse with Kathy or Eddie Daniels, or someone who was not a Xhosa.\nWe subsequently decided that there should be a fifth, rotating member of the High Organ. This member was usually not a Xhosa; Kathy, for\nexample, was the fifth member of the High Organ for more than five years. Laloo Chiba also served for a time, and in the end, the criticism died a\nslow and unremarkable death.\nI did not by any means dominate the High Organ, and in fact, a number, of proposals that I felt strongly about were rejected. This is as it should\nbe, but I sometimes found it frustrating. There were two issues regarding the authorities about which I could never persuade my colleagues. Prison\nregulations stated that prisoners must stand in the presence of a senior officer. I advocated that we should remain seated, as it was demeaning to\nhave to recognize the enemy when he did not recognize us as political prisoners. My comrades believed this was a trivial matter and the negative\nconsequences of resistance would outweigh any benefits.\nThe second issue was rejected by the High Organ on similar grounds. The warders called us by either our surnames or our Christian names.\nEach, I felt, was degrading, and I thought we should insist on the honorific \u201cMister.\u201d I pressed for this for many years, without success. Later, it even\nbecame a source of humor as my colleagues would occasionally call me \u201cMr.\u201d Mandela. TIME MAY SEEM to stand still for those of us in prison, but it did not halt for those outside. I was reminded of this when I was visited by my mother\nin the spring of . I had not seen her since the end of the Rivonia Trial. Change is gradual and incremental, and when one lives in the midst of\none\u2019s family, one rarely notices differences in them. But when one doesn\u2019t see one\u2019s family for many years at a time, the transformation can be\nstriking. My mother suddenly seemed very old.\nShe had journeyed all the way from the Transkei, accompanied by my son Makgatho, my daughter Makaziwe, and my sister Mabel. Because I\nhad four visitors and they had come a great distance, the authorities extended the visiting time from a half an hour to forty-five minutes.\nI had not seen my son and daughter since before the trial and they had become adults in the interim, growing up without me. I looked at them with\namazement and pride. But though they had grown up, I am afraid I still treated them more or less as the children they had been when I went to\nprison. They may have changed, but I hadn\u2019t.\nMy mother had lost a great deal of weight, which concerned me. Her face appeared haggard. Only my sister Mabel seemed unchanged. While it\nwas a great pleasure to see all of them and to discuss family issues, I was uneasy about my mother\u2019s health.\nI spoke with Makgatho and Maki about my desire for them both to pursue further schooling and asked Mabel about relatives in the Transkei. The\ntime passed far too quickly. As with most visits, the greatest pleasure often lies in the recollection of it, but this time, I could not stop worrying about\nmy mother. I feared that it would be the last time I would ever see her.\nSeveral weeks later, after returning from the quarry, I was told to go to the Head Office to collect a telegram. It was from Makgatho, informing me\nthat my mother had died of a heart attack. I immediately made a request to the commanding officer to be permitted to attend her funeral in the\nTranskei, which he turned down. \u201cMandela,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile I know you are a man of your word and would not try to escape, I cannot trust your own\npeople, and we fear that they would try to kidnap you.\u201d It added to my grief that I was not able to bury my mother, which was my responsibility as her\neldest child and only son.\nOver the next few months I thought about her a great deal. Her life had been far from easy. I had been able to support her when I was practicing\nas an attorney, but once I went to prison, I was unable to help her. I had never been as attentive as I should have been.\nA mother\u2019s death causes a man to look back on and evaluate his own life. Her difficulties, her poverty, made me question once again whether I\nhad taken the right path. That was always the conundrum: Had I made the right choice in putting the people\u2019s welfare even before that of my own\nfamily? For a long time, my mother had not understood my commitment to the struggle. My family had not asked for or even wanted to be involved in\nthe struggle, but my involvement penalized them.\nBut I came back to the same answer. In South Africa, it is hard for a man to ignore the needs of the people, even at the expense of his own family.\nI had made my choice, and in the end, she had supported it. But that did not lessen the sadness I felt at not being able to make her life more\ncomfortable, or the pain of not being able to lay her to rest.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of May , , the security police awakened Winnie at our home in Orlando and detained her without charge\nunder the  Terrorism Act, which gave the government unprecedented powers of arrest and detention without trial. The raid, I later learned, was\npart of a nationwide crackdown in which dozens of others were detained, including Winnie\u2019s sister. The police dragged Winnie away while Zeni and\nZindzi clung to her skirts. She was placed in solitary confinement in Pretoria, where she was denied bail and visitors; over the next weeks and\nmonths, she was relentlessly and brutally interrogated.\nWhen Winnie was finally charged \u2014 six months later \u2014 I managed to send instructions that she be represented by Joel Carlson, a longtime antiapartheid lawyer. Winnie and twenty-two others were charged under the Suppression of Communism Act for attempting to revive the ANC. Later,\nGeorge Bizos and Arthur Chaskalson, both members of the Rivonia team, joined the defense. In October, seventeen months after her arrest, the\nstate withdrew its case without explanation, and Winnie was released. Within two weeks, she was again banned, and placed under house arrest.\nShe immediately applied for permission to visit me and was rebuffed.\nThere was nothing I found so agonizing in prison as the thought that Winnie was in prison too. I put a brave face on the situation, but inwardly I\nwas deeply disturbed and worried. Nothing tested my inner equilibrium as much as the time that Winnie was in solitary confinement. Although I often\nurged others not to worry about what they could not control, I was unable to take my own advice. I had many sleepless nights. What were the\nauthorities doing to my wife? How would she bear up? Who was looking after our daughters? Who would pay the bills? It is a form of mental torture\nto be constantly plagued by such questions and not have the means to answer them.\nBrigadier Aucamp allowed me to send letters to Winnie, and relayed one or two from her. Normally, prisoners awaiting trial are not permitted\nmail, but Aucamp permitted it as a favor to me. I was grateful, but knew the authorities had not granted permission out of altruism: they were\nreading our letters, hoping to glean some information that would assist their case against Winnie.\n\nDuring this time I experienced another grievous loss. One cold morning in July of , three months after I learned of Winnie\u2019s incarceration, I was\ncalled to the main office on Robben Island and handed a telegram. It was from my youngest son, Makgatho, and it was only a sentence long. He\ninformed me that his older brother, my first and oldest son, Madiba Thembekile, whom we called Thembi, had been killed in a motorcar accident in\nthe Transkei. Thembi was then twenty-five years old, and the father of two small children.\nWhat can one say about such a tragedy? I was already overwrought about my wife, I was still grieving for my mother, and then to hear such news .\n. . I do not have words to express the sorrow, or the loss I felt. It left a hole in my heart that can never be filled.\nI returned to my cell and lay on my bed. I do not know how long I stayed there, but I did not emerge for dinner. Some of the men looked in, but I\nsaid nothing. Finally, Walter came to me and knelt beside my bed, and I handed him the telegram. He said nothing, but only held my hand. I do not\nknow how long he remained with me. There is nothing that one man can say to another at such a time.\nI asked permission of the authorities to attend my son\u2019s funeral. As a father, it was my responsibility to make sure that my son\u2019s spirit would rest\npeacefully. I told them they could send a security cordon with me, and that I would give my word that I would return. Permission was denied. All I was\npermitted to do was write a letter to Thembi\u2019s mother, Evelyn, in which I did my best to comfort her and tell her that I shared her suffering.\nI thought back to one afternoon when Thembi was a boy and he came to visit me at a safe house in Cyrildene that I used for secret ANC work.\nBetween my underground political work and legal cases, I had not been able to see him for some time. I surprised him at the house and found him\nwearing an old jacket of mine that came to his knees. He must have taken some comfort and pride in wearing his father\u2019s clothing, just as I once did\nwith my own father\u2019s. When I had to say good-bye again, he stood up tall, as if he were already grown, and said, \u201cI will look after the family while you\n\n\fare gone.\u201d THE GRAPH of improvement in prison was never steady. Progress was halting, and typically accompanied by setbacks. An advancement might\ntake years to win, and then be rescinded in a day. We would push the rock up the hill, only to have it tumble down again. But conditions did improve.\nWe had won a host of small battles that added up to a change in the atmosphere of the island. While we did not run the island, the authorities could\nnot run it without us, and in the aftermath of Van Rensburg\u2019s departure, our life became more tolerable.\nWithin our first three years on the island we were all given long trousers. By , we received our own individual prison uniforms, instead of\nbeing issued a different set each week. These uniforms actually fit us and we were allowed to wash them ourselves. We were permitted out in the\ncourtyard at all hours during the weekend. Although our food was not yet equalized, African prisoners would occasionally receive bread in the\nmorning. We were allowed to pool our food anyway, so that the differences did not matter. We had been given board games and cards, which we\noften played on Saturdays and Sundays. At the quarry, our talk was rarely interrupted. If the commanding officer was coming, the warders on duty\nwould blow a whistle to warn us to pick up our tools. We had neutralized the worst warders and befriended the more reasonable ones, though the\nauthorities realized this and rotated warders every few months.\nWe were able to meet among ourselves virtually whenever we wanted. Meetings of the High Organ, general members\u2019 meetings, and meetings\nof Ulundi were generally not broken up unless they were too conspicuous. The inmates seemed to be running the prison, not the authorities.\n\nStern and God-fearing, the Afrikaner takes his religion seriously. The one inflexible event on our weekly schedule was Sunday morning religious\nservices. This was an observance the authorities considered mandatory. It was as if they believed their own mortal souls would be in peril if they did\nnot give us the benefit of worship on Sunday.\nEvery Sunday morning, a minister from a different denomination would preach to us. One Sunday it would be an Anglican priest, the next a Dutch\nReform predikant, the next a Methodist minister. The clerics were recruited by the prison service, whose one edict was that they must preach\nexclusively on religious matters. Warders were present at all services and if the minister strayed from religion, he was not invited back.\nDuring the first two years on the island, we were not even permitted to leave our cells for Sunday services. The minister would preach from the\nhead of our corridor. By our third year, services were held in the courtyard, which we preferred. In those years, this was the only time we were\npermitted in the courtyard on Sunday, except for our half hour of exercise. Few of our men were religious, but no one minded long sermons; we\nenjoyed being outside.\nOnce services were held outside, we were given the option of attending. Some men only attended services in their own denomination. Though I\nam a Methodist, I would attend each different religious service.\n\nOne of our first ministers was an Anglican priest by the name of Father Hughes, a gruff, burly Welshman who had served as a chaplain in the\nsubmarine corps during the Second World War. When he first arrived, he was perturbed by having to preach in the corridor, which he found inimical\nto the contemplation of God. On his first visit, instead of preaching to us, he recited passages of Winston Churchill\u2019s wartime radio addresses in his\nbeautiful baritone: \u201cWe shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in\nthe hills; we shall never surrender.\u201d\nFather Hughes soon preached to us in the courtyard and we found his sermons splendid. He made a point of discreetly inserting bits and pieces\nof news into his sermons, something we appreciated. He might say, for example, that like the pharaoh of ancient Egypt, the prime minister of South\nAfrica was raising an army.\nWe always sang hymns at the end of services, and I think Father Hughes visited us so frequently just to hear us sing. He brought along a portable\norgan, and he would play for us. He praised our singing, saying that it was the only singing that matched the choirs in his native Wales.\nThe Methodist minister was a Reverend Jones, a nervous and gloomy fellow who had been based in the Congo during its revolution. His\nexperience there seemed to be the source of his melancholy. Over and over, he preached the importance of reconciliation \u2014 implying that it was\nwe who needed to reconcile ourselves to the whites.\nOne Sunday, during the reverend\u2019s one-sided message, I noticed Eddie Daniels shifting uneasily. Finally, Eddie could take it no longer. \u201cYou\u2019re\npreaching reconciliation to the wrong people,\u201d Eddie called out. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeking reconciliation for the last seventy-five years.\u201d This was\nenough for Reverend Jones and we never saw him again.\nReverend Jones was not the only minister Eddie scared away. We were visited by a Coloured minister known as Brother September. One\nSunday, a prisoner named Hennie Ferris, who was an eloquent speaker, volunteered to lead a prayer. Brother September was pleased to\nrecognize such devotion. Hennie began speaking in lofty language, and at one point, asked the congregation to close its eyes and pray. Everyone,\nincluding Brother September, obliged. Eddie then tiptoed to the front, opened Brother September\u2019s briefcase, and removed the Sunday Times of\nthat day. No one suspected anything at the time, but Brother September never brought newspapers again.\n\nReverend Andre Scheffler was a minister of the Dutch Reformed Mission Church in Africa, a sister church of the Dutch Reformed Church, the faith\nof nearly all the Afrikaner people. The Mission Church catered only to Africans. Reverend Scheffler was a crusty, conservative fellow who usually\npreached to the general prisoners. One Sunday, he wandered over to our section and we asked him why he didn\u2019t preach to us. \u201cYou men think you\nare freedom fighters,\u201d he said contemptuously. \u201cYou must have been drunk on liquor or high on dagga [marijuana] when you were arrested.\nFreedom fighters, my foot!\u201d But we challenged him to come to preach to us, and eventually, in the late s, he responded.\nReverend Scheffler was unorthodox in one respect: he took a scientific approach to religion. I found this very appealing. Many people use\nscience to debunk religion, but Reverend Scheffler enlisted science to bolster his beliefs. I recall one sermon in which he talked about the three\nWise Men from the East who followed a star until it led them to Bethlehem. \u201cThis is not just a superstition or a myth,\u201d he said, and then cited\nevidence from astronomers that at that time in history there was a comet that followed the path outlined in the Bible.\nAs Reverend Scheffler became familiar with us, he became more sympathetic. He had a dry sense of humor and liked to poke fun at us. \u201cYou\nknow,\u201d he would say, \u201cthe white man has a more difficult task than the black man in this country. Whenever there is a problem, we have to find a\nsolution. But whenever you blacks have a problem, you have an excuse. You can simply say, \u2018 Ingabilungu.\u2019 \u201d We burst into laughter not only\nbecause his pronunciation was unintentionally comical, but also because we were amused by the idea. \u201cNgabelungu\u201d is a Xhosa expression that\n\n\fmeans, \u201cIt is the whites.\u201d He was saying that we could always blame all of our troubles on the white man. His message was that we must also look\nwithin ourselves and become responsible for our actions \u2014 sentiments with which I wholeheartedly agreed.\n\nWhat Sundays were to the rest of the week, Christmas was to the rest of the year. It was the one day when the authorities showed any goodwill\ntoward men. We did not have to go to the quarry on Christmas Day, and we were permitted to purchase a small quantity of sweets. We did not have\na traditional Christmas meal, but we were given an extra mug of coffee for supper.\nThe authorities permitted us to organize a concert, hold competitions, and put on a play. The concert was the centerpiece. Our choirmaster was\nSelby Ngendane of the PAC. Selby had been a member of the ANC Youth League before switching allegiance to the Pan Africanist Congress. He\nwas a natural entertainer with a lovely voice and a fine ear.\nSelby chose the songs, arranged the harmonies, selected the soloists, and conducted the performance. The concert took place on Christmas\nmorning in the courtyard. We would mix in traditional English Christmas songs with African ones, and include a few protest songs \u2014 the authorities\ndid not seem to mind or perhaps know the difference. The warders were our audience, and they enjoyed our singing as much as we did.\nBefore coming to prison, Ngendane was perceived as something of a political lightweight. But in prison, Selby showed his mettle. In prison, one\nlikes to be around men who have a sunny disposition, and Selby had one.\nPrison was a kind of crucible that tested a man\u2019s character. Some men, under the pressure of incarceration, showed true mettle, while others\nrevealed themselves as less than what they had appeared to be.\n\nIn addition to the concerts, we held a chess and draughts (or checkers) tournament, and also played Scrabble and bridge. Every year, I competed\nin the draughts competition, and some years, I won the grand prize, which was usually a candy bar. My style of play was slow and deliberate; my\nstrategy conservative. I carefully considered the ramifications of every option and took a long time between moves. I resist such analogies, but it is\nmy preferred mode of operating not only in draughts but in politics.\nMost of my opponents played more swiftly, and often lost patience with my manner of play. One of my most frequent opponents was Don Davis. A\nmember of the Non-European Unity Movement, Don had grown up in the diamond-mining area of Kimberley and was a rugged, fearless fellow who\nwas also highly strung. Don was an excellent draughts player, but his style contrasted with mine. When Don played, perspiration would flow down\nhis face. He became tense and agitated as he played, and made his moves rapidly as though points were awarded for speed. Several times Don\nand I found ourselves in the finals of the annual tournament.\nDon called me Qhipu because of a habit I had when playing draughts. I would ponder each possibility, and then when I was about to move, I\nwould call out, \u201cQhipu!\u201d \u2014 which means \u201cI strike!\u201d \u2014 and then move the piece. Don found this frustrating and he called me Qhipu more in irritation\nthan in amity.\nDon and I played in many tournaments, and even if he won, he would come back within a few minutes, challenging me to another match. Don\nalways wanted to play draughts, and did not seem satisfied until I responded. Soon I was spending so much time playing with Don that my other\npursuits languished. When I once failed to pass an exam in my studies, a few colleagues asked me why, and I responded, to much laughter, \u201cDon\nDavis!\u201d\n\nOur amateur drama society made its yearly offering at Christmas. My thespian career, which had lain dormant since I played John Wilkes Booth\nwhile at Fort Hare, had a modest revival on Robben Island. Our productions were what might now be called minimalist: no stage, no scenery, no\ncostumes. All we had were the words of the play.\nI only performed in a few dramas, but I had one memorable role: that of Creon, the king of Thebes, in Sophocles\u2019 Antigone. I had read some of\nthe classic Greek plays in prison, and found them enormously elevating. What I took out of them was that character was measured by facing up to\ndifficult situations and that a hero was a man who would not break even under the most trying circumstances.\nWhen Antigone was chosen as the play, I volunteered my services, and was asked to play Creon, an elderly king fighting a civil war over the\nthrone of his beloved city-state. At the outset of the play, Creon is sincere and patriotic, and there is wisdom in his early speeches when he\nsuggests that experience is the foundation of leadership and that obligations to the people take precedence over loyalty to an individual.\nOf course you cannot know a man completely,\nhis character, his principles, sense of judgment,\nnot till he\u2019s shown his colors, ruling the people,\nmaking laws. Experience, there\u2019s the test.\n\nBut Creon deals with his enemies mercilessly. He has decreed that the body of Polynices, Antigone\u2019s brother, who had rebelled against the city,\ndoes not deserve a proper burial. Antigone rebels, on the grounds that there is a higher law than that of the state. Creon will not listen to Antigone,\nnor does he listen to anyone but his own inner demons. His inflexibility and blindness ill become a leader, for a leader must temper justice with\nmercy. It was Antigone who symbolized our struggle; she was, in her own way, a freedom fighter, for she defied the law on the grounds that it was\nunjust.\n SOME OF THE WARDERS began to engage us in conversation. I never initiated conversations with warders, but if they addressed a question to\nme, I tried to answer. It is easier to educate a man when he wants to learn. Usually, these questions were posed with a kind of exasperation: \u201cAll\nright, Mandela, what is it you really want?\u201d Or, \u201cLook, you have a roof over your head and enough food, why are you causing so much trouble?\u201d I\nwould then calmly explain our policies to the warders. I wanted to demystify the ANC for them, to peel away their prejudices.\nIn  a young warder arrived who seemed particularly eager to get to know me. I had heard rumors that our people on the outside were\norganizing an escape for me, and had infiltrated a warder onto the island who would assist me. Gradually, this fellow communicated to me that he\nwas planning my escape.\nIn bits and pieces he explained the plan: one night, he would drug the warders on duty at the lighthouse to allow for the landing of a boat on the\nbeach. He would furnish me with a key to get out of our section so that I could meet the boat. On the boat I was to be equipped with underwater\ndiving gear, which I would use to swim into the harbor at Cape Town. From Cape Town, I would be taken to a local airport and flown out of the\ncountry.\nI listened to the plan in its entirety and did not communicate to him how far-fetched and unreliable it sounded. I consulted with Walter, and we\nagreed that this fellow was not to be trusted. I never told him that I would not do it, but I never took any of the actions required to implement the plan.\nHe must have gotten the message, for he was soon transferred off the island.\nAs it turned out, my mistrust was justified, for we later learned that the warder was an agent of the Bureau of State Security (BOSS), South\nAfrica\u2019s secret intelligence agency. The plot was that I was to be successfully taken off the island, but killed in a dramatic shootout with security\nforces at the airport as I tried to leave the country. The entire plan had been dreamed up by BOSS, even the rumors that reached me about the\nANC\u2019s planning an escape. It was not the last time they would try to eliminate me.\n\nThe term of a commanding officer was usually no more than three years, and we had been through several by . That year, Robben Island\u2019s\ncommanding officer was Colonel Van Aarde, a rather amiable, harmless fellow who allowed us free rein. But at the end of the year, the authorities\nconcluded that they wanted a different atmosphere on the island, and Colonel Piet Badenhorst was named the new C.O. of Robben Island.\nThis was an ominous development. Badenhorst was reputed to be one of the most brutal and authoritarian officers in the entire prison service.\nHis appointment indicated one thing: the government believed that discipline on the island was too lax, and that a strong hand was needed to keep\nus in line. Badenhorst would supposedly make us yearn for the days of Suitcase.\nWhenever a new commanding officer was appointed, I requested a meeting with him. I did this in order to impress upon him the seriousness of\nour cause and also to evaluate his character. I requested a meeting with Colonel Badenhorst and was turned down. He was the first commanding\nofficer to spurn such a meeting.\nWe felt the effects of his regime before we ever saw him. A number of the newer regulations regarding study and free time were immediately\nrescinded. It was obvious that he intended to roll back every privilege we had won over the years. Our old warders were transferred off the island\nand replaced by Badenhorst\u2019s handpicked guards. They were younger, coarser men who enforced every niggling regulation, whose job was to\nharass and demoralize us. Within days of Badenhorst\u2019s appointment, our cells were raided and searched; books and papers were confiscated;\nmeals were suspended without warning; and men were jostled on the way to the quarry.\nBadenhorst attempted to turn back the clock to the way the island was in the early s. The answer to every question was always no. Prisoners\nwho requested to see their lawyers were given solitary confinement instead. Complaints were completely ignored. Visits were canceled without\nexplanation. The food deteriorated. Censorship increased.\nAbout a week after Badenhorst arrived, we were working at the quarry one morning when, without introduction or fanfare, Badenhorst and his\ndriver pulled up in the commander\u2019s car. He got out and surveyed us from a distance. We paused to look at our new commander. Badenhorst\nreturned my glance and called out, \u201cMandela, Jy moet jou vinger uit jou gat trek\u201d (You must pull your finger out of your arse). I did not care for this\nexpression at all, and without thinking, I started advancing toward Badenhorst. He was still a distance away, and before I got close he had returned\nto his car and driven away.\nFrom his car, Badenhorst radioed a command to his staff, and within minutes a truck had arrived to transport us back to Section B. We were\ncommanded to be silent in the truck, and when we arrived at the courtyard, we were ordered to stand at attention. Badenhorst appeared in front of\nus, pacing back and forth. He seemed incapable of uttering a sentence without including an oath or swearword. \u201cJou ma se moer,\u201d was his favorite\nexpression. \u201cYour mother is a moer\u201d \u2014 moer being a vulgar term for an intimate part of a woman\u2019s anatomy.\nIn his guttural voice, he told us he was disgusted to have observed our laziness at the quarry. As a result, he said, he was arbitrarily dropping all\nof our classifications by one notch. Though we despised the classification system, most of the men had by that time risen to at least C level, where\nthey were permitted to study. D level prisoners were not allowed to study. The authorities rued the fact that they had allowed us study privileges, and\nBadenhorst was determined to rectify that mistake.\nLater, after my anger abated, I realized that Badenhorst\u2019s crude remark to me at the quarry was a calculated one. He had been brought to\nRobben Island to restore order, and he had singled out the individual he assumed was the source of the disorder. Like a teacher who takes over a\nrowdy class, he sought to discipline the student he regarded as the principal troublemaker. IN LATE MAY of , a number of men from SWAPO (the South-West African People\u2019s Organization), an ally of the ANC fighting for\nindependence in Namibia, were brought to the isolation section. They were led by Andimba Toivo ja Toivo, a founder of SWAPO and a formidable\nfreedom fighter. We learned that they had embarked on a hunger strike to protest their isolation, and we immediately decided to join in. This\nangered Badenhorst and the authorities who regarded this as unacceptable insubordination.\nLate on the night of May , we were awakened by shouts and fierce knocking on our cell doors. \u201cGet up! Get up!\u201d the warders yelled. We were\nordered to strip and then line up against the wall of the courtyard. The warders were obviously drunk and were yelling and taunting us. They were led\nby a sadistic fellow named Fourie, whom we privately called Gangster.\nIt was a bitterly cold night, and for the next hour, while we stood at attention naked and shivering, our cells were searched one by one. Warders\nkept up their abuse for the entire time. Toward the end of the hour, Govan experienced severe chest pains and collapsed. This seemed to scare\nFourie, and he ordered us to return to our cells.\nThe warders searched high and low, and found nothing. But the search seemed only an excuse for Fourie\u2019s sadistic impulses. Only later did we\nlearn that Fourie was reputed to have molested prisoners in the general section. The following day we discovered that the warders had brutally\nbeaten some general prisoners before they came to us, and afterward, assaulted Toivo ja Toivo, who hit back and knocked down the warder who\nwas beating him. Toivo was severely punished for this.\nWe filed a formal complaint about our treatment, but it was ignored. The incident stands out in my memory, but it was by no means unique;\nincidents like it were the rule rather than the exception during Badenhorst\u2019s command.\n\nWe were determined not to let conditions deteriorate entirely under Badenhorst. We smuggled messages to our people on the outside to agitate\nfor his dismissal. At the same time, we resolved to create a delegation among ourselves to see Badenhorst. We discussed this for months and\ngradually decided on its composition; Walter and I represented the ANC, and each of the other parties had two representatives as well.\nBadenhorst agreed to meet us, and at our parley we threatened work stoppages, go-slows, hunger strikes \u2014 every weapon at our disposal \u2014\nunless he reformed his ways and restored many of the privileges that he had rescinded. He merely said he would take what we said under\nconsideration. We regarded this confrontation as a victory, for he was wary of us and knew that we had alerted people on the outside of our\ncomplaints. These efforts soon produced a response.\nA few weeks later, we knew an important visit must be imminent because when it rained that day at the quarry we were allowed to take shelter\ninstead of continuing to work. The following day we were informed that a troika of judges were coming to the island. The authorities asked us to\nnominate a spokesman to express our grievances, and I was chosen.\nAs I was preparing for my meeting with the judges, I was informed by a reliable source that a prisoner in the general section had recently been\nseverely beaten by a guard. The three judges were Justices Jan Steyn, M. E. Theron, and Michael Corbett of the Cape provincial division of the\nSupreme Court. They were escorted by the commissioner of prisons, General Steyn, and accompanied by Colonel Badenhorst. I met them that day\noutside, where we were working.\nGeneral Steyn introduced me to the judges and explained that I had been selected to represent the other prisoners. The judges then indicated\nthat as a matter of course they would talk with me privately. I replied that I had nothing to hide and that in fact I welcomed the presence of General\nSteyn and the colonel. I could see that they were taken aback by my statement, and I added that it would be only proper for them to have the\nopportunity to reply to my charges. The judges reluctantly acquiesced.\nI began by recounting the recent assault in the general section. I told them the details that had been reported to me, the viciousness of the\nbeating, and the cover-up of the crime. I had barely begun to speak when I noticed Badenhorst shifting uncomfortably. When I had finished\ndescribing the incident, Badenhorst interjected in a gruff, aggressive manner: \u201cDid you actually witness this assault?\u201d I replied calmly that I had not\nbut that I trusted the people who had told me of it. He snorted and wagged his finger in my face. \u201cBe careful, Mandela,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you talk about\nthings you haven\u2019t seen, you will get yourself in trouble. You know what I mean.\u201d\nI ignored Badenhorst\u2019s remarks and turned to the judges and said, \u201cGentlemen, you can see for yourselves the type of man we are dealing with\nas commanding officer. If he can threaten me here, in your presence, you can imagine what he does when you are not here.\u201d Judge Corbett then\nturned to the others and said, \u201cThe prisoner is quite right.\u201d\nI spent the remainder of the meeting enumerating complaints about our diet, work, and studying. Inwardly Badenhorst must have been fuming, but\noutwardly he seemed chastened. At the end of the session, the judges thanked me, and I bade them good-bye.\nI have no idea what the judges said or did after the meeting, but over the next few months, Badenhorst seemed to have his hands tied. The\nharshness abated, and within three months of the judges\u2019 visit, we received word that Badenhorst was to be transferred.\n\nA few days before Badenhorst\u2019s departure, I was called to the main office. General Steyn was visiting the island and wanted to know if we had any\ncomplaints. Badenhorst was there as I went through a list of demands. When I had finished, Badenhorst spoke to me directly. He told me that he\nwould be leaving the island, and added, \u201cI just want to wish you people good luck.\u201d I do not know if I looked dumbfounded, but I was amazed. He\nspoke these words like a human being, and showed a side of himself we had never seen before. I thanked him for his good wishes, and wished\nhim luck in his endeavors.\nI thought about this moment for a long time afterward. Badenhorst had perhaps been the most callous and barbaric commanding officer we had\nhad on Robben Island. But that day in the office, he had revealed that there was another side to his nature, a side that had been obscured but that\nstill existed. It was a useful reminder that all men, even the most seemingly cold-blooded, have a core of decency, and that if their heart is touched,\nthey are capable of changing. Ultimately, Badenhorst was not evil; his inhumanity had been foisted upon him by an inhuman system. He behaved\nlike a brute because he was rewarded for brutish behavior. IT WAS ANNOUNCED that Colonel Willemse would succeed Colonel Badenhorst as commanding officer. I requested a meeting with the colonel\nafter his appointment and visited with him shortly after his arrival. While he was obviously not a progressive man, he was courteous and reasonable,\nin marked contrast to his predecessor. Badenhorst\u2019s tenure, we hoped, would simply be a dip on the graph of the steady improvement of our\nconditions.\nThe aggressive young warders departed with Badenhorst as well, and we quickly resumed our customary behavior at the quarry and in our\nsection. Willemse may have been a reasonable man, but when he saw that we spent more time at the quarry talking than working, he was shocked.\nHe had been on the island for only a few weeks when I was summoned to his office for a meeting. \u201cMandela,\u201d he said frankly, \u201cyou must help me.\u201d\nI asked him how. \u201cYour men are not working. They don\u2019t listen to orders. They only do what they want to do. This is a prison. There must be some\ndiscipline. It is not only good for us but good for you. We must have some order or they will bring back someone like the previous head of prison.\u201d\nWhat the colonel said made sense. I listened and told him that his request was a legitimate one, but before I could respond to him, I would need\nto meet with all my men. At that time, a meeting of all prisoners in the single cells was something that was expressly forbidden. By asking him to\npermit such a meeting, I was asking him for a significant extension of the rules. He knew this as well as I did, and he wanted some time to consider\nit.\nWithin days, I received a communication from Willemse saying he would allow it. All of us met one afternoon in the courtyard, without guards\nwatching over us. I told the men what Willemse said, and noted that by compromising a bit now, we would be making our conditions better in the\nlong run. We decided that we would at least appear to be working, but what work we did would be at a pace that suited us. From then on, that is\nwhat we did, and we heard no more complaints from the commanding officer.\n\nDuring the early part of Willemse\u2019s tenure, in \u2013, there was a steady influx of captured MK soldiers. These men had seen combat, and were\nwell informed about the state of the exile movement. While I was never happy to see ANC men imprisoned, I was keen to debrief them after they\narrived. I was extremely eager to know about Oliver, about the training camps, about MK\u2019s successes and failures.\nThe men were extremely militant, and they did not take to prison life easily. One of the first of these men was Jimmy April, an MK officer who had\ntrained under Joe Slovo and had fought against the enemy in Rhodesia. MK had been slowly infiltrating men back into the country with forged\nidentity documents. Jimmy had been one of them and he was arrested in South Africa.\nJimmy regaled us with war stories, but I also took him aside and asked him about MK\u2019s problems. As I was founder of MK and its first\ncommander-in-chief, Jimmy and the others were more candid with me than they were with the others. He told me stories of discontent in the camps,\nand of abuses by MK officers. I asked him to keep the matter to himself, and I managed to smuggle a letter out to Oliver suggesting that some\nreforms must be made in the camps.\nOne day, I was at the Head Office meeting with Colonel Willemse when I saw Jimmy outside the office of another official. He turned to me and\nsaid in some agitation, \u201cThey are refusing to give me my letter.\u201d\n\u201cOn what ground?\u201d I replied.\n\u201cThey claim it contains matter which I am not allowed to see,\u201d he said. I entered the office to discuss the matter, but before I could even open my\nmouth, Jimmy had barged in and loudly said to the official, \u201cGive me my letter!\u201d Jimmy began to push me aside to get to the officer\u2019s desk and take\nthe letter himself. At this point, the official took the letter and moved behind me as if for protection from Jimmy. It might have been a comical scene\nin a film, but at the time it was nerve-racking. I turned to Jimmy and said quietly but sternly, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this. Calm down. I\u2019ll sort out this matter\nand see to it that you get your letter. Now, please leave.\u201d\nMy speech had the intended effect, and Jimmy left the office. I then turned to the officer, who was extremely rattled. It was, for me, an odd\nposition. I was not opposing the authorities but mediating between my own people and the men I had so long fought against. The militancy of those\nwho were coming to the island put me in this position more and more frequently. While we were encouraged by their radicalism, these men\nsometimes made our day-to-day life more burdensome.\nWithin a week, the officer handed me Jimmy\u2019s letter.\n ONE MORNING, instead of walking to the quarry, we were ordered into the back of a truck. It rumbled off in a new direction, and fifteen minutes\nlater we were ordered to jump out. There in front of us, glinting in the morning light, we saw the ocean, the rocky shore, and in the distance, winking\nin the sunshine, the glass towers of Cape Town. Although it was surely an illusion, the city, with Table Mountain looming behind it, looked\nagonizingly close, as if one could almost reach out and grasp it.\nThe senior officer explained to us that we had been brought to the shore to collect seaweed. We were instructed to pick up the large pieces that\nhad washed up on the beach, and wade out to collect seaweed attached to rocks or coral. The seaweed itself was long and slimy and brownishgreen in color. Sometimes the pieces were six to eight feet in length and thirty pounds in weight. After fishing out the seaweed from the shallows,\nwe lined it up in rows on the beach. When it was dry, we loaded it into the back of the truck. We were told it was then shipped to Japan, where it\nwas used as a fertilizer.\nThe work did not seem too taxing to us that day, but in the coming weeks and months, we found it could be quite strenuous. But that hardly\nmattered because we had the pleasures and distractions of such a panoramic tableau: we watched fishing ships trawling, stately oil tankers moving\nslowly across the horizon; we saw gulls spearing fish from the sea and seals cavorting on the waves; we laughed at the colony of penguins, which\nresembled a brigade of clumsy, flat-footed soldiers; and we marveled at the daily drama of the weather over Table Mountain, with its shifting\ncanopy of clouds and sun.\nIn the summer, the water felt wonderful, but in winter, the icy Benguela currents made wading out into the waves a torture. The rocks on and\naround the shore were jagged, and we often cut and scraped our legs as we worked. But we preferred the sea to the quarry, although we never\nspent more than a few days there at a time.\n* * *\nThe ocean proved to be a treasure chest. I found beautiful pieces of coral and elaborate shells, which I sometimes brought back to my cell. Once\nsomeone discovered a bottle of wine stuck in the sand that was still corked. I am told it tasted like vinegar. Jeff Masemola of the PAC was an\nextremely talented artist and sculptor, and the authorities allowed him to harvest pieces of driftwood, which he carved into fantastic figures, some of\nwhich the warders offered to buy. He constructed a bookcase for me, which I used for many years. The authorities told visitors that they had\nprovided me with it.\nThe atmosphere at the shore was more relaxed than at the quarry. We also relished the seaside because we ate extremely well there. Each\nmorning when we went to the shore, we would take a large drum of fresh water. Later, we would bring along a second drum, which we would use to\nmake a kind of Robben Island seafood stew. For our stew we would pick up clams and mussels. We also caught crayfish, which hid themselves in\nthe crevices of rocks. Capturing a crayfish was tricky; one had to grab it firmly between its head and tail or it would wiggle free.\nAbalone, or what we call parlemoen, was my favorite dish. Abalones are mollusks that cling tenaciously to rocks, and one has to pry them loose.\nThey are stubborn creatures, difficult to open, and if they are the slightest bit overcooked, they are too tough to eat.\nWe would take our catch and pile it into the second drum. Wilton Mkwayi was the chef among us and he would concoct the stew. When it was\nready, the warders would join us and we would all sit down on the beach and have a kind of picnic lunch. In , in a smuggled newspaper, we\nread about the wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips, and the story detailed the bridal luncheon of rare and delicate dishes. The menu\nincluded mussels, crayfish, and abalone, which made us laugh; we were dining on such delicacies every day.\nOne afternoon, we were sitting on the beach eating our stew when Lieutenant Terblanche, who was then head of prison, made a surprise visit.\nWe quickly pretended to be working, but we had not fooled him. He soon discovered the second drum containing a mussel stew bubbling over the\nfire. The lieutenant opened the pot and looked inside. He then speared a mussel, ate it, and pronounced it \u201cSmaaklik,\u201d Afrikaans for \u201ctasty.\u201d IN THE SUMMER OF , I was playing tennis in the courtyard, when my opponent hit a cross-court shot that I strained to reach. As I ran across\nthe court, I felt a pain in my right heel that was so intense I had to stop playing. For the next few days I walked with a severe limp.\nI was examined by a doctor on the island who decided I should go to Cape Town to see a specialist. The authorities had become more solicitous\nof our health, afraid that if we died in prison they would be condemned by the international community.\nAlthough under normal circumstances I and the other men would relish a visit to Cape Town, going as a prisoner was altogether different. I was\nhandcuffed and kept in a remote corner of the boat surrounded by five armed warders. The sea was rough that day, and the boat shuddered at\nevery wave. About midway between the island and Cape Town, I thought we were in danger of capsizing. I spied a lifejacket behind two warders\nyoung enough to be my grandsons. I said to myself, \u201cIf this boat goes under, I will commit my last sin on earth and run over those two boys to get that\nlifejacket.\u201d But in the end, it was unnecessary.\nOn the docks, we were met by more armed guards and a small crowd. It is a humiliating experience to watch the fear and disgust on ordinary\ncitizens\u2019 faces when they watch a convict go by. My inclination was to duck down and hide, but one could not do that.\nI was examined by a young surgeon who asked if I had ever before injured my heel. In fact, I had when I was at Fort Hare. One afternoon, I was\nplaying soccer when I attempted to steal the ball and felt a searing pain in my heel. I was taken to the local hospital, the first time in my life I had ever\nbeen to a hospital or seen a doctor. Where I grew up, there was no such thing as an African doctor, and going to see a white doctor was unheard\nof.\nThe Fort Hare doctor examined my heel and said he would need to operate. The diagnosis alarmed me, and I abruptly told him that I did not want\nhim to touch me. At that stage in my life I regarded seeing a doctor as unmanly and having a medical procedure seemed even worse. \u201cSuit\nyourself,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when you are old this thing will worry you.\u201d\nThe Cape Town surgeon X-rayed my heel and discovered bone fragments that had probably been there since Fort Hare. He said he could\nremove them in a procedure that could be performed with a local anesthetic right in his office. I immediately agreed.\nThe surgery went well, and when it was over, the doctor was explaining to me how to care for my heel. He was abruptly interrupted by the head\nwarder, who said that I had to return immediately to Robben Island. The surgeon was incensed by this and in his most authoritative manner said that\nit was necessary for Mr. Mandela to remain in hospital overnight and that he would not release me under any circumstances. The warder was\nintimidated and acquiesced.\nMy first night in a proper hospital turned out to be quite pleasant. The nurses fussed over me a good deal. I slept very well, and in the morning, a\ngroup of nurses came in and said that I should keep the pajamas and dressing gown that I had been given. I thanked them and told them that I\nwould be the envy of all my comrades.\nI found the trip instructive in another way because in that hospital I sensed a thawing in the relationship between black and white. The doctor and\nnurses had treated me in a natural way as though they had been dealing with blacks on a basis of equality all their lives. This was something new\nand different to me, and an encouraging sign. It reaffirmed my long-held belief that education was the enemy of prejudice. These were men and\nwomen of science, and science had no room for racism.\nMy only regret was that I did not have the opportunity to contact Winnie before I went into hospital. Rumors had appeared in newspapers that I\nwas at death\u2019s door and she had become quite concerned. But when I returned, I wrote to her to dispel her fears.\n* * *\nIn , we were granted the right to buy newspapers. This was a victory, but as always, each new privilege contained within it a catch. The new\nregulation stated that A Group prisoners were granted the right to buy one English-language newspaper and one Afrikaans newspaper a day. But\nthe annoying caveat was that any A Group prisoner found sharing his newspaper with a non\u2013A Group prisoner would lose his newspaper\nprivileges. We protested against this restriction, but to no avail.\nWe received two daily newspapers: the Cape Times and Die Burger. Both were conservative papers, especially the latter. Yet prison censors\nwent through each of those newspapers every day with scissors, clipping articles that they deemed unsafe for us to see. By the time we received\nthem, they were filled with holes. We were soon able to supplement these papers with copies of the Star, the Rand Daily Mail, and the Sunday\nTimes, but these papers were even more heavily censored.\n\nOne story I was certainly not able to read was in the Johannesburg Sunday Post in March . The headline was \u201cFREE MANDELA!\u201d Inside was\na petition that people could sign to ask for my release and that of my fellow political prisoners. While newspapers were still barred from printing my\npicture or any words I had ever said or written, the Post\u2019s campaign ignited a public discussion of our release.\nThe idea had been conceived in Lusaka by Oliver and the ANC, and the campaign was the cornerstone of a new strategy that would put our\ncause in the forefront of people\u2019s minds. The ANC had decided to personalize the quest for our release by centering the campaign on a single\nfigure. There is no doubt that the millions of people who subsequently became supporters of this campaign had no idea of precisely who Nelson\nMandela was. (I am told that when \u201cFree Mandela\u201d posters went up in London, most young people thought my Christian name was Free.) There\nwere a handful of dissenting voices on the island who felt that personalizing the campaign was a betrayal of the collectivity of the organization, but\nmost people realized that it was a technique to rouse the people.\nThe previous year I had been awarded the Jawaharlal Nehru Human Rights Award in India, another bit of evidence of the resurgence of the\nstruggle. I was of course refused permission to attend the ceremony, as was Winnie, but Oliver accepted the award in my absence. We had a\nsense of a reviving ANC. Umkhonto we Sizwe was stepping up its sabotage campaign, which had become far more sophisticated. In June, MK set\noff bombs at the vast Sasolburg refinery just south of Johannesburg. MK was orchestrating an explosion a week at some strategic site or another.\nBombs exploded at power stations in the eastern Transvaal, at police stations in Germiston, Daveyton, New Brighton, and elsewhere, and at the\nVoortrekkerhoogte military base outside Pretoria. These were all strategically significant locations, places that would attract attention and worry the\nstate. The defense minister, General Magnus Malan, backed by P. W. Botha, introduced a policy known as \u201ctotal onslaught,\u201d which was a\nmilitarization of the country to combat the liberation struggle.\nThe Free Mandela campaign had its lighter side as well. In , I learned that the students at the University of London had nominated me as a\ncandidate for the honorific post of university chancellor. This was a wonderful honor, to be sure, and my rivals were none other than Princess Anne\nand the trade union leader Jack Jones. In the end, I polled , votes and lost to the daughter of the queen. I wrote to Winnie in Brandfort that I\n\n\fhoped the voting might have for a moment turned her humble shack into a castle, making its tiny rooms as grand as the ballroom at Windsor.\nThe campaign for our release rekindled our hopes. During the harsh days of the early s, when the ANC seemed to sink into the shadows,\nwe had to force ourselves not to give in to despair. In many ways, we had miscalculated; we had thought that by the s we would be living in a\ndemocratic, nonracial South Africa. Yet as we entered the new decade my hopes for that South Africa rose once again. Some mornings I walked\nout into the courtyard and every living thing there, the seagulls and wagtails, the small trees, and even the stray blades of grass, seemed to smile\nand shine in the sun. It was at such times when I perceived the beauty of even this small, closed-in corner of the world, that I knew that someday my\npeople and I would be free.\n",
    "1974-1980": " THE OPPRESSION of my wife did not let up. In , security policemen kicked down the door of  Orlando West. Bricks were hurled through\nthe window. Gunshots were fired at the front door. In , Winnie was charged with violating her banning orders, which restricted her from having\nany visitors apart from her children and her doctor. She was then working at a lawyer\u2019s office, and a friend brought Zeni and Zindzi to see her during\nher lunch hour. For this, Winnie was charged and then sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment. She was put in Kroonstad Prison, in the Orange\nFree State, but her experience there was not as horrendous as her previous stay in Pretoria. Winnie wrote to me that she felt liberated in prison this\ntime, and it served to reaffirm her commitment to the struggle. The authorities permitted Zindzi and Zeni to visit her on Sundays.\nWhen Winnie was released in , we managed, through letters and communications with our lawyers, to work out a plan for me to see Zindzi.\nPrison regulations stated that no child between the ages of two and sixteen may visit a prisoner. When I went to Robben Island, all my children were\nin this legal limbo of age restrictions. The reasoning behind the rule is not pernicious: the lawmakers presumed that a prison visit would negatively\naffect the sensitive psyches of children. But the effect on prisoners was perhaps equally damaging. It is a source of deep sorrow not to be able to\nsee one\u2019s children.\nIn , Zindzi turned fifteen. The plan was for her mother to alter Zindzi\u2019s birth documents to show that the girl was turning sixteen, not fifteen,\nand therefore able to see me. Birth records are not kept in a very uniform or organized way for Africans, and Winnie found that it was not hard to\nmodify her documents to show that Zindzi was born a year earlier. She applied for a permit, and it was approved.\n\nA few weeks before Zindzi\u2019s scheduled visit in December, I had a previously arranged visit with Winnie\u2019s mother. When I was seated across from\nher in the visiting area, I said to her, \u201cWell, Ma, I\u2019m very excited because I\u2019m going to see Zindzi.\u201d My mother-in-law, who was a former teacher,\nregarded me with some surprise and then said in a rather peevish way, \u201cNo, Zindzi cannot come and see you because she is not yet sixteen.\u201d\nI realized immediately that no one had told her about our gambit. There was a warder behind each of us, and I decided I would simply gloss over\nwhat she had said, and mumbled, \u201cAh, well, Ma, it is nothing.\u201d\nBut my mother-in-law is a stubborn woman and she did not let it pass. \u201cWell, Mkonyanisi\u201d \u2014 an affectionate term for son-in-law in Xhosa, which is\nwhat she always called me \u2014 \u201cyou have made a serious error because Zindzi is only fifteen.\u201d\nI widened my eyes in a gesture of alarm and she must have gotten the message because she did not mention Zindzi again.\n\nI had not seen Zindzi since she was three years old. She was a daughter who knew her father from old photographs rather than memory. I put on a\nfresh shirt that morning, and took more trouble than usual with my appearance: it is my own vanity, but I did not want to look like an old man for my\nyoungest daughter.\nI had not seen Winnie for over a year, and I was gratified to find that she looked well. But I was delighted to behold what a beautiful woman my\nyoungest daughter had become and how closely she resembled her equally beautiful mother.\nZindzi was shy and hesitant at first. I am sure it was not easy for her finally to see a father she had never really known, a father who could love her\nonly from a distance, who seemed to belong not to her but to the people. Somewhere deep inside her she must have harbored resentment and\nanger for a father who was absent during her childhood and adolescence. I could see right away that she was a strong and fiery young woman like\nher own mother had been when she was Zindzi\u2019s age.\nI knew she would be feeling uncomfortable, and I did my best to lighten the atmosphere. When she arrived I said to her, \u201cHave you met my guard\nof honor?,\u201d gesturing to the warders who followed me everywhere. I asked her questions about her life, her schooling, and her friends, and then tried\nto take her back to the old days that she barely remembered. I told her how I often recalled Sunday mornings at home when I dandled her on my\nknee while Mum was in the kitchen making a roast. I recollected small incidents and adventures in Orlando when she was a baby, and how she had\nrarely cried even when she was small. Through the glass, I could see her holding back her tears as I talked.\n\nThe one tragic note of the visit was when I learned from Winnie that Bram Fischer had died of cancer shortly after being let out of prison. Bram\u2019s\ndeath affected me deeply. Although the government left no fingerprints on Bram\u2019s body, it was the state\u2019s relentless harassment of him that brought\non the final illness that took him too soon. They hounded him even after death \u2014 the state confiscated his ashes after his cremation.\nBram was a purist, and after the Rivonia Trial, he decided he could best serve the struggle by going underground and living the life of an outlaw. It\nburdened him that the men whom he was representing in court were going to prison while he lived freely. During the trial, I advised Bram not to take\nthis route, stressing that he served the struggle best in the courtroom, where people could see this Afrikaner son of a judge president fighting for the\nrights of the powerless. But he could not let others suffer while he remained free. Like the general who fights side by side with his troops at the front,\nBram did not want to ask others to make a sacrifice that he was unwilling to make himself.\nBram went underground while out on bail and was captured in , and sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to commit sabotage. I\nhad tried to write him in prison, but regulations forbade prisoners from corresponding with each other. After he had been diagnosed with cancer, a\nnewspaper campaign calling for his release on humanitarian grounds had influenced the government. It was just a few weeks after the authorities\nreleased him, still under house arrest, to his brother\u2019s house in Bloemfontein that he died.\nIn many ways, Bram Fischer, the grandson of the prime minister of the Orange River Colony, had made the greatest sacrifice of all. No matter\nwhat I suffered in my pursuit of freedom, I always took strength from the fact that I was fighting with and for my own people. Bram was a free man\nwho fought against his own people to ensure the freedom of others.\n\nA month after this visit I received word from Winnie that her most recent request for a visit had been turned down by the authorities on the absurd\ngrounds that I did not wish to see her. I immediately made an appointment with Lieutenant Prins, who was then head of prison, to lodge a protest.\nPrins was not what one would call a sophisticated man. When I went in to see him I explained the situation evenly and without animosity. But I\nsaid the situation as it stood was unacceptable and my wife must be permitted to visit.\nPrins did not appear to be listening, and when I had finished he said, \u201cAg, Mandela, your wife is only seeking publicity.\u201d I told him that I resented\nhis remark, and before I had even finished, he uttered something so offensive and uncomplimentary about my wife that I immediately lost my\n\n\ftemper.\nI rose from my chair and started to move around the desk toward the lieutenant. Prins began to retreat, but I soon checked myself. Instead of\nassaulting him with my fists, as I felt like doing, I pummeled him with words. I am not a man who approves of oaths or curses, but that day I violated\nmy own principle. I finished by telling him that he was a contemptible man without honor, and that if he ever repeated those same words I would not\nhold myself back as I had that day.\nWhen I had finished, I turned and stormed out of his office. As I was leaving, I saw Kathy and Eddie Daniels outside but I did not even greet them\nas I walked back to my cell. Even though I had silenced Prins, he had caused me to violate my self-control and I consider that a defeat at the hands\nof my opponent.\nAfter breakfast the following morning, two warders entered my cell and said I was wanted at the Head Office. When I reached the office, I was\nsurrounded by a half-dozen armed warders. Off to one side was Lieutenant Prins and in the center of this circle was a warrant officer who was the\nprison prosecutor. The atmosphere was tense.\n\u201cWell, Mandela,\u201d the prosecutor said, \u201cI hear you had yourself a nice time yesterday, but today will not be so pleasant. I am charging you for\nhaving insulted and threatened the head of prison. It is a grave charge.\u201d He then handed me the summons.\n\u201cDo you have anything to say?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I replied. \u201cYou can speak with my attorney.\u201d I then asked to be taken back to my cell. Prins did not say a word.\n\nI knew immediately what I would do: prepare a countersuit charging everyone from the lieutenant all the way up to the minister of justice with\nmisconduct. I would indict the prison system as a whole as a racist institution that sought to perpetuate white supremacy. I would make the case a\ncause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, and make them regret they had ever charged me in the first place.\nI asked George Bizos to represent me, and a meeting was soon arranged. Before George\u2019s visit I informed the authorities that I would be giving\nhim written instructions. They asked me why and I replied frankly that I assumed the consultation room was bugged. The authorities then refused\npermission for me to give a written statement; I must make an oral one. I told them that they had no right to withhold permission, and the fact that\nthey did only confirmed my suspicions.\nThe truth was that the authorities were afraid George would leak a written statement to the press. This was indeed part of our strategy. They were\nalso concerned that I was using George as a conduit to communicate with Oliver in Lusaka, and assumed that the written statement would contain\nsensitive information. I had previously used George for such purposes, but the document in question did not contain such material.\nA date was set for the island\u2019s disciplinary court, and a magistrate from Cape Town was assigned. A day before the hearing, I was told that my\nattorney would be arriving the following day and I would be free to give him my written statement. I met George at the head office in the morning and\nwe briefly consulted before court was called into session. But the hearing had no sooner started than the prosecutor announced that the prison was\nwithdrawing its case. The judge gaveled the session to a close and abruptly left the room. George and I looked at each other in surprise, and\ncongratulated one another on an apparent victory. I was putting away my papers when another warrant officer came over and, pointing to my written\nstatement, said, \u201cHand me that file.\u201d\nI refused, saying it was a confidential matter between myself and my attorney. I called over the prosecutor and said: \u201cInform this man that these\ndocuments are protected by attorney-client privilege, and that I do not have to turn them over.\u201d The prosecutor replied that they were, but that the\ncase was over, court was no longer in session, and the only authority in the room was that of the warrant officer. The officer plucked the document\noff the table. There was nothing I could do to stop him. I believe the authorities dropped the case simply to get hold of that document \u2014 which, as\nthey discovered, contained nothing they did not already know.\n\nAs unlikely a prospect as it may have seemed, I nevertheless thought about escape the entire time I was on the island. Mac Maharaj and Eddie\nDaniels, both brave and resourceful men, were always hatching plans and discussing possibilities. Most were far too dangerous, but that did not\nstop us from considering them.\nWe had made certain advances. Jeff Masemola, our master craftsman, had managed to make a passkey that unlocked most of the doors in and\naround our section. One day, a warder had left his key on the desk in the office at the end of our corridor. Jeff took a piece of soap and made an\nimprint of the key. Using that outline, he took a piece of metal and filed it into the shape of the key. This key gave us access to some of the\nstorerooms behind our cells as well as to the isolation section. But we never used it to leave our section. It was the sea, after all, that was the\nuncrossable moat around Robben Island.\nIn , Mac had an idea how to cross that barrier. He had recently been taken to the dentist in Cape Town and discovered that the dentist\nhimself was related by marriage to a well-known political prisoner. The dentist was sympathetic; he had refused to treat Mac unless Mac\u2019s leg irons\nwere first removed. Mac had also noticed that the window in the dentist\u2019s second-floor waiting room was just a short drop to a small side-street\nwhere we might make a run for it.\nWhen Mac returned, he met with a few of us and urged us to make appointments at the dentist. We did so, and learned that a day had been\narranged for Mac, Wilton Mkwayi, me, and one other prisoner to go to Cape Town. The three of us were willing to make the attempt, but when Mac\ncontacted the fourth man, he refused. We had doubts about this man\u2019s loyalty, and it concerned me that he knew what we were planning.\nThe three of us were taken by boat to Cape Town and then to the dentist\u2019s office under heavy guard. All three of us had trained as soldiers and\nwe probably had the best chance of actually executing an escape. Mac was also carrying a knife, and was prepared to use it. At the dentist\u2019s office,\nthe guards first cleared away all the other patients. We demanded to have our leg irons removed, and with the support of the dentist, our guards\ntook them off.\nMac led us over to the window and pointed out the street that was our escape route. But something about the street bothered Mac as soon as he\nsaw it: we were in the center of Cape Town in the middle of the day, and yet the street was empty. When he had been here before, the street had\nbeen filled With traffic. \u201cIt\u2019s a setup,\u201d Mac whispered. I, too, had the sense that something was not right, and I agreed with Mac. Wilton, whose\nadrenaline was flowing, said Mac was talking nonsense. \u201cMadiba, you\u2019re losing your nerve,\u201d he said. But I agreed with Mac, and the three of us\nsimply ended up having our teeth examined. The dentist was curious as to why I had come, because my teeth were fine.\n\nWhile Mac considered the most practical escape plans, Eddie Daniels hatched the most imaginative ones. During the early years, airplanes were\n\n\fnot permitted to fly over the island. But by the mid-s, we noticed that not only were planes flying over our heads, but helicopters on their way to\nand from the tankers that sailed off the coast. Eddie came to me with a plan that would involve the organization using a helicopter, painted with the\nSouth African military colors, to pick me up on the island and then deposit me on the roof of a friendly foreign embassy in Cape Town where I would\nseek asylum. It was not an ill-conceived plan, and I told Eddie he should smuggle out the suggestion to Oliver in Lusaka. Eddie did manage to get\nhis idea to Lusaka, but we never received a response. BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS were bare-bones affairs on Robben Island. In lieu of cake and gifts, we would pool our food and present an extra\nslice of bread or cup of coffee to the birthday honoree. Fikile Bam and I were born on the same date, July , and I would save a few sweets that I\nhad purchased at Christmas for the two of us to share on our mutual anniversary. My fiftieth birthday had passed without much notice in , but in\n, when I turned fifty-seven, Walter and Kathy approached me with a long-term plan that would make my sixtieth birthday more memorable.\nOne of the issues that always concerned us was how to keep the idea of the struggle before the people. During the previous decade, the\ngovernment had silenced most of the radical press, and there remained a prohibition on publishing the words or pictures of any banned or\nimprisoned individuals. An editor could go to jail and his newspaper be shuttered for publishing so much as a snapshot of me or my colleagues.\nOne day, Kathy, Walter, and myself were talking in the courtyard when they suggested that I ought to write my memoirs. Kathy noted that the\nperfect time for such a book to be published would be on my sixtieth birthday. Walter said that such a story, if told truly and fairly, would serve to\nremind people of what we had fought and were still fighting for. He added that it could become a source of inspiration for young freedom fighters.\nThe idea appealed to me, and during a subsequent discussion, I agreed to go ahead.\nWhen I decide to do something, I like to start immediately, and I threw myself into this new project. I adopted a rather unorthodox work schedule: I\nwould write most of the night and sleep during the day. During the first week or two, I would take a nap after dinner, awake at ten o\u2019clock, and then\nwrite until it was time for breakfast. After working at the quarry, I would then sleep until dinner, and the process would begin again. After a few\nweeks of this, I notified the authorities that I was not feeling well and would not be going to the quarry. They did not seem to care, and from then on I\nwas able to sleep most of the day.\nWe created an assembly line to process the manuscript. Each day I passed what I wrote to Kathy, who reviewed the manuscript, and then read it\nto Walter. Kathy then wrote their comments in the margins. Walter and Kathy have never hesitated to criticize me, and I took their suggestions to\nheart, often incorporating their changes. This marked-up manuscript was then given to Laloo Chiba, who spent the next night transferring my writing\nto his own almost microscopic shorthand, reducing ten pages of foolscap to a single small piece of paper. It would be Mac\u2019s job to smuggle the\nmanuscript to the outside world.\nThe warders grew suspicious. They went to Mac and said, \u201cWhat is Mandela up to? Why is he sitting up late at night?\u201d But Mac merely shrugged\nhis shoulders and said he had no idea. I wrote rapidly, completing a draft in four months. I did not hesitate over choosing a word or phrase. I\ncovered the period from my birth through the Rivonia Trial, and ended with some notes about Robben Island.\nI relived my experiences as I wrote about them. Those nights, as I wrote in silence, I could once again experience the sights and sounds of my\nyouth in Qunu and Mqhekezweni; the excitement and fear of coming to Johannesburg; the tempests of the Youth League; the endless delays of the\nTreason Trial; the drama of Rivonia. It was like a waking dream and I attempted to transfer it to paper as simply and truthfully as I could.\n\nMac ingeniously hid the transcribed version of the manuscript inside the binding of a number of notebooks he used for his studies. In this way, he\nwas able to safeguard the entire text from the authorities and smuggle it out when he was released in . The arrangement was that Mac would\nsecretly communicate when the manuscript was safely out of the country; only then would we destroy the original. In the meantime, we still had to\ndispose of a five-hundred-page manuscript. We did the only thing we could do: we buried it in the garden in the courtyard. Surveillance in the\ncourtyard had become careless and sporadic. The warders usually sat in an office at the northern end talking among themselves. From that office,\nthey could not see the southern end next to the isolation area where there was a small garden. I had casually inspected this area on my early\nmorning walks, and it was there that I decided to bury the manuscript.\nIn order not to have to dig a great hole, we decided to bury the manuscript in three separate places. We divided it into two smaller segments and\none larger one, wrapped each in plastic, and placed them inside empty cocoa containers. The work would have to be done quickly, and I asked Jeff\nMasemola to fashion some digging tools. Within a few days I was equipped with several sharp iron stakes.\nOne morning, after breakfast, Kathy, Walter, Eddie Daniels, and I drifted over to the garden at the southern end of the courtyard where we\nappeared to be having a political discussion. We were each hiding portions of the manuscript in our shirts. At a signal from me, we dropped down\nand began digging. I dug in the center, near a manhole cover that led to a drainpipe. When I reached the pipe, I carved out a space beneath it, and\nit was there that I placed the largest of the three containers. The others dug two shallower holes for their portions.\nWe finished just in time to line up for our march to the quarry. As I walked that morning, I felt a sense of relief that the manuscript was safely\nhidden. I then thought no more about it.\n\nA few weeks later, just after our wake-up call, I heard a sound in the courtyard that made me uneasy: it was the thud of picks and shovels on the\nground. When we were allowed out of our cells for wash-up, I walked to the front of the corridor and managed to peer out the door and around the\ncorner. There, at the south end of the courtyard, was a work crew from the general section. To my alarm, they were digging in the area where the\nmanuscript was buried.\nThe authorities had decided to build a wall in front of the isolation section because they had discovered that the prisoners in isolation were able\nto communicate with us in the courtyard. The work crew was digging a shallow trench for the concrete foundation of the wall.\nWhile washing up I managed to inform Walter and Kathy about the digging outside. Kathy thought that the main part of the manuscript, which was\nburied under the pipe, would probably be safe, but that the other two were vulnerable. When the drums of breakfast porridge were wheeled into the\ncourtyard, the warders commanding the work crew ordered the men out of the yard. This was done to prevent any fraternization with the political\nprisoners.\nWith our bowls of porridge in hand, I led Walter and Kathy over to the south end of the courtyard as though I wanted to confer with them privately.\nThe beginnings of the trench were already perilously close to the two smaller containers. At the same time, we were joined by Eddie Daniels, who\nimmediately recognized the problem.\nThere was only one thing to do: as inconspicuously as possible, the four of us began digging in the area where the two smaller pieces of\nmanuscript would be. We managed to unearth the two containers rather quickly, and covered the area again with soil. To rescue the chunk of\nmanuscript under the pipe would require more time, but we were confident that they would not find the manuscript because they would not dislodge\nthe pipe in order to build the wall.\nWe hid the manuscript in our shirts as we walked back to our cells. Eddie was not going to the quarry that day, and we gave the containers to\nhim, instructing him to destroy them as soon as possible. At great personal risk, Eddie agreed to do so. I breathed easier knowing that we had\n\n\fsalvaged the two containers, and tried not to dwell on the remaining piece of manuscript as I worked that day.\n\nWhen we returned from the quarry that afternoon, instead of washing up, which I normally did, I strolled over to the far end of the courtyard. I\nattempted to appear as casual as possible, but I was alarmed by what I saw. The prisoners had dug a trench that ran parallel to the wall of the\nisolation section and had actually removed the pipe altogether. They could not help but have uncovered the manuscript.\nI must have flinched or reacted in some way that was noticeable. Unknown to me, I was being watched by a number of warders, who later said\nthat my reaction confirmed that I knew a manuscript had been there. I returned to the corridor to wash up and told Walter and Kathy that I suspected\nthe manuscript had been discovered. Eddie had meanwhile successfully disposed of the other two pieces.\nEarly the next morning, I was summoned to the office to see the commanding officer. Next to him stood a high prison official who had just arrived\nfrom Pretoria. Without any greeting whatsoever, the commanding officer announced: \u201cMandela, we have found your manuscript.\u201d\nI did not reply. The commanding officer then reached behind his desk and produced a sheaf of papers.\n\u201cThis is your handwriting, is it not?\u201d he demanded. Again, I remained silent.\n\u201cMandela,\u201d the commander said in some exasperation. \u201cWe know this is your work.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I replied, \u201cyou must produce some proof of that.\u201d They scoffed at this, and said they knew the notations in the margin were made by Walter\nSisulu and Ahmed Kathrada. Again, I said that they must furnish evidence if they were going to impose any penalties.\n\u201cWe do not need evidence,\u201d the commander said. \u201cWe have the evidence.\u201d\nAlthough he did not impose a penalty that day, a short while later, Walter, Kathy, and I were called before General Rue, the deputy commissioner\nof prisons, who told us that we had abused our study privileges in order to illegally write the manuscript. For that offense, our study privileges were\nbeing suspended indefinitely. As it turned out, we lost study privileges for four years.\n\nAfter Mac was released in December, he sent the notebooks overseas to England. He spent the next six months under house arrest in South Africa\nbefore slipping out of the country and going first to Lusaka to see Oliver, and then to London. He stayed there for six months; with a typist he\nreconstructed the manuscript and put together a typescript. He then returned to Lusaka and presented Oliver with a copy.\nFrom there, the trail grows cold. I heard nothing from Lusaka about the manuscript and still do not know precisely what Oliver did with it. Although\nit was not published while I was in prison, it forms the spine of this memoir. IN , after we had spent almost fifteen years agitating for the right to receive news, the authorities offered us a compromise. Instead of\npermitting us to receive newspapers or listen to radio, they started their own radio news service, which consisted of a daily canned summary of the\nnews read over the prison\u2019s intercom system.\nThe broadcasts were far from objective or comprehensive. Several of the island\u2019s censors would compile a brief news digest from other daily\nradio bulletins. The broadcasts consisted of good news for the government and bad news for all its opponents.\nThe first broadcast opened with a report about the death of Robert Sobukwe. Other early reports concerned the victories of Ian Smith\u2019s troops in\nRhodesia and detentions of government opponents in South Africa. Despite the slanted nature of the news, we were glad to have it, and prided\nourselves on reading between the lines and making educated guesses based on the obvious omissions.\nThat year, we learned via the intercom that P. W. Botha had succeeded John Vorster as prime minister. What the warders did not tell us was that\nVorster resigned as a result of press revelations about the Department of Information\u2019s misuse of government funds. I knew little about Botha apart\nfrom the fact that he had been an aggressive defense minister and had supported a military strike into Angola in . We had no sense that he\nwould be a reformer in any way.\nI had recently read an authorized biography of Vorster (this was one of the books the prison library did have) and found that he was a man willing\nto pay for his beliefs; he went to prison for his support of Germany during the Second World War. We were not sorry to see Vorster go. He had\nescalated the battle against freedom to new heights of repression.\nBut even without our expurgated radio broadcast, we had learned what the authorities did not want us to know. We learned of the successful\nliberation struggles in Mozambique and Angola in  and their emergence as independent states with revolutionary governments. The tide was\nturning our way.\n\nIn keeping with the increased openness on the island, we now had our own cinema. Almost every week, we watched films on a sheet in a large\nroom adjacent to our corridor. Later, we had a proper screen. The films were a wonderful diversion, a vivid escape from the bleakness of prison\nlife.\nThe first films we saw were silent, black-and-white Hollywood action movies and westerns that were even before my time. I recall one of the first\nones was The Mark of Zorro, with the swashbuckling Douglas Fairbanks, a movie that was made in . The authorities seemed to have a\nweakness for historical films, particularly ones with a stern moral message. Among the early films we saw \u2014 now in color, with dialogue \u2014 were\nThe Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston as Moses, The King and I, with Yul Brynner, and Cleopatra, with Richard Burton and Elizabeth\nTaylor.\nWe were intrigued by The King and I, for to us it depicted the clash between the values of East and West, and seemed to suggest that the West\nhad much to learn from the East. Cleopatra proved controversial; many of my comrades took exception to the fact that the queen of Egypt was\ndepicted by a raven-haired, violet-eyed American actress, however beautiful. The detractors asserted that the movie was an example of Western\npropaganda that sought to erase the fact that Cleopatra was an African woman. I related how on my trip to Egypt I saw a splendid sculpture of a\nyoung, ebony-skinned Cleopatra.\nLater, we also saw local South African films with black stars whom we all knew from the old days. On those nights, our little makeshift theater\nechoed with the shouts, whistles, and cheers that greeted the appearance of an old friend on screen. Later, we were permitted to select\ndocumentaries \u2014 a form that I preferred \u2014 and I began to skip the conventional films. (Although I would never miss a movie with Sophia Loren in\nit.) The documentaries were ordered from the state library and usually selected by Ahmed Kathrada, who was our section\u2019s librarian. I was\nparticularly affected by a documentary we saw about the great naval battles of World War II, which showed newsreel footage of the sinking of the\nH.M.S. Prince of Wales by the Japanese. What moved me most was a brief image of Winston Churchill weeping after he heard the news of the\nloss of the British vessel. The image stayed in my memory a long time, and demonstrated to me that there are times when a leader can show\nsorrow in public, and that it will not diminish him in the eyes of his people.\n\nOne of the documentaries we watched concerned a controversial American motorcycle group, the Hell\u2019s Angels. The film depicted the Hell\u2019s\nAngels as reckless, violent, and antisocial, and the police as decent, upstanding, and trustworthy. When the film ended, we immediately began to\ndiscuss its meaning. Almost without exception the men criticized the Hell\u2019s Angels for their lawless ways. But then Strini Moodley, a bright, young\nBlack Consciousness member, stood up and accused the assembled group of being out of touch with the times, for the bikers represented the\nequivalent of the Soweto students of  who rebelled against the authorities. He reproached us for being elderly middle-class intellectuals who\nidentified with the movie\u2019s right-wing authorities instead of with the bikers.\nStrini\u2019s accusations caused a furor, and a number of men rose to speak against him, saying the Hell\u2019s Angels were indefensible and it was an\ninsult to compare our struggle with this band of amoral sociopaths. But I considered what Strini said, and while I did not agree with him, I came to\nhis defense. Even though the Hell\u2019s Angels were unsympathetic, they were the rebels against the authorities, unsavory rebels though they were.\nI was not interested in the Hell\u2019s Angels, but the larger question that concerned me was whether we had, as Strini suggested, become stuck in a\nmind-set that was no longer revolutionary. We had been in prison for more than fifteen years; I had been in prison for nearly eighteen. The world that\nwe left was long gone. The danger was that our ideas had become frozen in time. Prison is a still point in a turning world, and it is very easy to\nremain in the same place in jail while the world moves on.\nI had always attempted to remain open to new ideas, not to reject a position because it was new or different. During our years on the island we\nkept up a continuing dialogue about our beliefs and ideas; we debated them, questioned them, and thereby refined them. I did not think we had\nstayed in one place; I believe we had evolved.\nAlthough Robben Island was becoming more open, there was as yet still no sign that the state was reforming its views. Even so, I did not doubt\nthat I would someday be a free man. We may have been stuck in one place, but I was confident the world was moving toward our position, not away\nfrom it. The movie reminded me once again that on the day I did walk out of prison, I did not want to appear to be a political fossil from an age long\npast.\n\n\fIt took fifteen years, but in , the authorities announced over the intercom system that the diet for African, Coloured, and Indian prisoners would\nhenceforth be the same. But just as justice delayed is justice denied, a reform so long postponed and so grudgingly enacted was hardly worth\ncelebrating.\nAll prisoners were to receive the same amount of sugar in the morning: a spoonful and a half. But instead of simply increasing the African quota,\nthe authorities reduced the amount of sugar that Coloured and Indian prisoners received by half a spoonful, while adding that amount for African\nprisoners. A while before, African prisoners had begun to receive bread in the morning, but that made little difference. We had been pooling bread\nfor years.\nOur food had already improved in the previous two years, but not because of the authorities. In the wake of the Soweto uprising, the authorities\nhad decided that the island would become the exclusive home of South Africa\u2019s \u201csecurity prisoners.\u201d The number of general prisoners had been\ndrastically reduced. As a result, political prisoners were recruited to work in the kitchen for the first time. Once political prisoners were in the\nkitchen, our diet improved dramatically. This was not because they were better chefs, but because the smuggling of food immediately stopped.\nInstead of siphoning off food for themselves or to bribe the warders, the new cooks used all the food allotted us. Vegetables became more\nabundant, and chunks of meat began to appear in our soups and stews. Only then did we realize we should have been eating such food for years. IN , I RECEIVED an extraordinary visit: Jimmy Kruger, the minister of prisons, a prominent member of the prime minister\u2019s cabinet, came to\nsee me. Kruger was not only influential about prisons policy but he was critical to the government\u2019s handling of the liberation struggle.\nI had an inkling as to why he had come. The government was then engaged in a massive effort to make a success of its separate development\npolicy, and \u201cquasi-independent\u201d homelands. The showpiece of separate development was the Transkei, led by my nephew and one-time\nbenefactor, K. D. Matanzima, who had successfully repressed almost all legitimate opposition to his rule. I recalled that the commanding officer had\nrecently said to me in a bantering way, \u201cMandela, you ought to retire to the Transkei and take a good long rest.\u201d\nAs it turned out, that was precisely what Jimmy Kruger was proposing as well. He was a stout, blunt man, not nearly as polished as I would have\nexpected from a cabinet minister. I approached the meeting as another opportunity to present our grievances, and at first he seemed content to\nlisten. I began by reminding him of the letter we had sent him in , which had gone unanswered. He merely shrugged. I then detailed the poor\nconditions on the island, reiterating once more that we were political prisoners, not criminals, and expected to be treated as such. But Kruger\nscoffed at this, saying, \u201cNah, you are all violent Communists!\u201d\nI then began to tell him a bit about the history of our organization and why we had turned to violence. It was clear that he knew almost nothing\nabout the ANC, and what he did know was gleaned from the propaganda of the right-wing press. When I told him the organization was far older\nthan the National Party, he was dumbfounded. I said that if he considered us Communists he should reread the Freedom Charter. He looked at me\nblankly. He had never heard of the Freedom Charter. I found it extraordinary that a cabinet minister should be so uninformed. Yet I should not have\nbeen surprised; Nationalist politicians routinely condemned what they didn\u2019t understand.\nI raised the question of our release and reminded him of the case of the  Afrikaner rebels, who had resorted to violence though they were\nrepresented in Parliament, could hold meetings, and could even vote. Even though General de Wet and General Kemp had led a force of twelve\nthousand and occupied towns and caused many deaths, they were both released soon after their convictions for high treason. I mentioned the case\nof Robey Leibbrandt, who set up an underground organization during the Second World War to oppose South Africa\u2019s support for the Allies; he\nwas sentenced to life imprisonment but soon pardoned. Kruger seemed as ignorant of these episodes in the history of his own people as he was of\nthe Freedom Charter. It is difficult to negotiate with those who do not share the same frame of reference.\nKruger waved all of this aside. \u201cThat is ancient history,\u201d he said. He came armed with a specific offer. Despite his reputation for brusqueness, he\nmade his proposal in a deferential manner. He stated the matter simply: if I recognized the legitimacy of the Transkei government and was willing to\nmove there, my sentence would be dramatically reduced.\nI listened respectfully until he had finished. First, I said, I wholly rejected the bantustan policy, and would do nothing to support it, and second, I\nwas from Johannesburg, and it was to Johannesburg that I would return. Kruger remonstrated with me, but to no avail. A month later he returned with\nthe same proposal, and again I turned him down. It was an offer only a turncoat could accept. AS DILIGENT AS WE WERE in gathering news and information, our knowledge of current events was always sketchy. Happenings in the outside\nworld were muffled by the fact that we heard of them first through rumor; only later might they be confirmed by a newspaper account or an outside\nvisitor.\nIn June of , we began to hear vague reports of a great uprising in the country. The whispers were fanciful and improbable: the youth of\nSoweto had overthrown the military and the soldiers had dropped their guns and fled. It was only when the first young prisoners who had been\ninvolved in the June  uprising began to arrive on Robben Island in August that we learned what truly happened.\nOn June , , fifteen thousand schoolchildren gathered in Soweto to protest the government\u2019s ruling that half of all classes in secondary\nschools must be taught in Afrikaans. Students did not want to learn and teachers did not want to teach in the language of the oppressor. Pleadings\nand petitions by parents and teachers had fallen on deaf ears. A detachment of police confronted this army of earnest schoolchildren and without\nwarning opened fire, killing thirteen-year-old Hector Pieterson and many others. The children fought with sticks and stones, and mass chaos\nensued, with hundreds of children wounded, and two white men stoned to death.\nThe events of that day reverberated in every town and township of South Africa. The uprising triggered riots and violence across the country.\nMass funerals for the victims of state violence became national rallying points. Suddenly the young people of South Africa were fired with the spirit\nof protest and rebellion. Students boycotted schools all across the country. ANC organizers joined with students to actively support the protest.\nBantu Education had come back to haunt its creators, for these angry and audacious young people were its progeny.\n\nIn September, the isolation section was filled with young men who had been arrested in the aftermath of the uprising. Through whispered\nconversations in an adjacent hallway we learned firsthand what had taken place. My comrades and I were enormously cheered; the spirit of mass\nprotest that had seemed dormant through the s was erupting in the s. Many of these young people had left the country to join our own\nmilitary movement, and then smuggled themselves back home. Thousands of them were trained in our camps in Tanzania, Angola, and\nMozambique. There is nothing so encouraging in prison as learning that the people outside are supporting the cause for which you are inside.\nThese young men were a different breed of prisoner than we had ever seen before. They were brave, hostile, and aggressive; they would not\ntake orders, and shouted \u201cAmandla!\u201d at every opportunity. Their instinct was to confront rather than cooperate. The authorities did not know how to\nhandle them, and they turned the island upside down. During the Rivonia Trial, I remarked to a security policeman that if the government did not\nreform itself, the freedom fighters who would take our place would someday make the authorities yearn for us. That day had indeed come on\nRobben Island.\nIn these young men we saw the angry revolutionary spirit of the times. I had had some warning. At a visit with Winnie a few months before, she\nhad managed to tell me through our coded conversation that there was a rising class of discontented youth who were militant and Africanist in\norientation. She said they were changing the nature of the struggle and that I should be aware of them.\nThe new prisoners were appalled by what they considered the barbaric conditions of the island, and said they could not understand how we could\nlive in such a way. We told them that they should have seen the island in . But they were almost as skeptical of us as they were of the\nauthorities. They chose to ignore our calls for discipline and thought our advice feeble and unassertive.\nIt was obvious that they regarded us, the Rivonia Trialists, as moderates. After so many years of being branded a radical revolutionary, to be\nperceived as a moderate was a novel and not altogether pleasant feeling. I knew that I could react in one of two ways: I could scold them for their\nimpertinence or I could listen to what they were saying. I chose the latter.\nWhen some of these men, such as Strini Moodley of the South African Students\u2019 Organization and Saths Cooper of the Black People\u2019s\nConvention, came into our section, I had them give us papers on their movement and philosophy. I wanted to know what had brought them to the\nstruggle, what motivated them, what their ideas were for the future.\nShortly after their arrival on the island, the commanding officer came to me and asked me as a favor to address the young men. He wanted me to\ntell them to restrain themselves, to recognize the fact that they were in prison and to accept the discipline of prison life. I told him that I was not\nprepared to do that. Under the circumstances, they would have regarded me as a collaborator of the oppressor.\n\nThese fellows refused to conform to even basic prison regulations. One day I was at the Head Office conferring with the commanding officer. As I\nwas walking out with the major, we came upon a young prisoner being interviewed by a prison official. The young man, who was no more than\neighteen years old, was wearing his prison cap in the presence of senior officers, a violation of regulations. Nor did he stand up when the major\nentered the room, another violation.\nThe major looked at him and said, \u201cPlease, take off your cap.\u201d The prisoner ignored him. Then in an irritated tone, the major said, \u201cTake off your\ncap.\u201d The prisoner turned and looked at the major, and said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d\nI could hardly believe what I had just heard. It was a revolutionary question: What for? The major also seemed taken aback, but managed a reply.\n\u201cIt is against regulations,\u201d he said. The young prisoner responded, \u201cWhy do you have this regulation? What is the purpose of it?\u201d This questioning on\nthe part of the prisoner was too much for the major, and he stomped out of the room, saying, \u201cMandela, you talk to him.\u201d But I would not intervene on\nhis behalf, and simply bowed in the direction of the prisoner to let him know that I was on his side.\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThis was our first exposure to the Black Consciousness Movement. With the banning of the ANC, PAC, and Communist Party, the Black\nConsciousness Movement helped fill a vacuum among young people. Black Consciousness was less a movement than a philosophy and grew out\nof the idea that blacks must first liberate themselves from the sense of psychological inferiority bred by three centuries of white rule. Only then could\nthe people rise up in confidence and truly liberate themselves from repression. While the Black Consciousness Movement advocated a nonracial\nsociety, they excluded whites from playing a role in achieving that society.\nThese concepts were not unfamiliar to me: they closely mirrored ideas I myself held at the time of the founding of the ANC Youth League a\nquarter-century before. We, too, were Africanists; we, too, stressed ethnic pride and racial self-confidence; we, too, rejected white assistance in the\nstruggle. In many ways, Black Consciousness represented the same response to the same problem that had never gone away.\nBut just as we had outgrown our Youth League outlook, I was confident that these young men would transcend some of the strictures of Black\n\n\fConsciousness. While I was encouraged by their militancy, I thought that their philosophy, in its concentration on blackness, was exclusionary, and\nrepresented an intermediate view that was not fully mature. I saw my role as an elder statesman who might help them move on to the more inclusive\nideas of the Congress Movement. I knew also that these young men would eventually become frustrated because Black Consciousness offered no\nprogram of action, no outlet for their protest.\nAlthough we viewed the ranks of the BCM as a fertile ground for the ANC, we did not attempt to recruit these men. We knew that this would\nalienate both them and the other parties on the island. Our policy was to be friendly, to take an interest, to compliment them on their achievements,\nbut not to proselytize. If they came to us and asked questions \u2014 \u201cWhat is the ANC policy on the bantustans?\u201d \u201cWhat does the Freedom Charter say\nabout nationalization?\u201d \u2014 we would answer them \u2014 and a great many of them did come to us with questions.\nI myself contacted some of these men through smuggled notes. I spoke with some who were from the Transkei and asked questions about my\nold home. Some of the men who arrived were already well known in the struggle. I had heard reports of the bravery of Patrick \u201cTerror\u201d Lekota, a\nleader of the South African Students\u2019 Organization, and sent him a note of welcome to Robben Island.\nTerror\u2019s nickname comes from his prowess on the soccer field, but he was just as formidable in a debate. He disagreed with some of his\ncolleagues on the issue of racial exclusiveness and inched closer to the ideas of the ANC. Once on the island, Terror decided that he wanted to join\nus, but we discouraged him \u2014 not because we did not want him but because we thought such a maneuver would create tensions in the general\nsection.\nBut Terror would not take no for an answer and publicly switched his allegiance to the ANC. One day, not long afterward, he was assaulted with a\ngarden fork by disgruntled BC members. After he was treated, the authorities charged the attackers and planned to put them on trial. But in the\ninterest of harmony, we advised Terror not to lodge a complaint. He agreed, and refused to testify against those who had hurt him. The case was\ndropped. Such a trial, I felt, would only play into the hands of the authorities. I wanted these young men to see that the ANC was a great tent that\ncould accommodate many different views and affiliations.\nAfter that incident, the floodgates seemed to open and dozens of BC men decided to join the ANC, including some of those who had planned the\nattack on Terror. Terror rose to the top of the ANC hierarchy in the general section, and was soon teaching ANC policies to other prisoners. The\ncourage and vision of men like Lekota confirmed to us that our views remained potent, and still represented the best hope for unifying the liberation\nstruggle as a whole.\n\nPolitical feuding continued in F and G. We learned of a clash among the ANC, the PAC, and the BCM in the general section. A number of ANC\npeople had been beaten. A large number of ANC members were charged by the authorities, and a trial was set for the island\u2019s administrative court.\nThe ANC men brought in an outside lawyer to handle the case. Although I had not witnessed the fight, I was asked to be a character witness. This\nwas a troubling prospect. While I was more than willing to give testimonials for my comrades, I did not want to take any action that would heighten\nthe bitterness between the ANC, the PAC, and the BCM.\nI regarded my role in prison not just as the leader of the ANC, but as a promoter of unity, an honest broker, a peacemaker, and I was reluctant to\ntake a side in this dispute, even if it was the side of my own organization. If I testified on behalf of the ANC, I would jeopardize my chances of\nbringing about reconciliation among the different groups. If I preached unity, I must act like a unifier, even at the risk of perhaps alienating some of\nmy own colleagues.\nI decided not to testify. This disappointed some of my colleagues, but I thought the issue was serious enough to risk their displeasure. It was\nmore important to show the young Black Consciousness men that the struggle was indivisible and that we all had the same enemy.\n I DO NOT KNOW whether it was the upheaval inside the prison after the Soweto uprising or the upheaval in my family\u2019s life outside of prison, but in\nthe year or two following  I was in a dreamy, nostalgic state of mind. In prison, one has time to review the past, and memory becomes both\nfriend and foe. My memory transported me into moments of both great joy and sadness. My dream life became very rich, and I seemed to pass\nentire nights reliving the high and low times of the old days.\nI had one recurring nightmare. In the dream, I had just been released from prison \u2014 only it was not Robben Island, but a jail in Johannesburg. I\nwalked outside the gates into the city and found no one there to meet me. In fact, there was no one there at all, no people, no cars, no taxis. I would\nthen set out on foot toward Soweto. I walked for many hours before arriving in Orlando West, and then turned the corner toward . Finally, I\nwould see my home, but it turned out to be empty, a ghost house, with all the doors and windows open, but no one at all there.\nBut not all my dreams of release were so dark. In  I wrote to Winnie of a happier vision.\nThe night of  February, I dreamt arriving at  finding the house full of youth dancing away to a mixture of jive and infiba. I caught all of them by surprise as I walked in\nunexpectedly. Some greeted me warmly, whilst others simply melted away shyly. I found the bedroom equally full with members of the family and close friends. You were relaxing in\nbed, with Kgatho [my son Makgatho], looking young and sleeping against the opposite wall.\nPerhaps in that dream I was recalling the two weeks in December  when he was six and when I left Makhulu [Evelyn\u2019s mother] alone in the house. He was living with his\nmother in O.E. [Orlando East] then, but a few days before I came back he joined Makhulu and slept in my bed. He was missing me very much and using the bed must have relieved\nthe feeling of longing a bit.\n\nWhile I took joy from dwelling on happy moments, I rued the pain I had often caused my family through my absence. Here is another letter from\n.\nAs I woke up on the morning of  February I was missing you and the children a great deal as always. These days I spend quite some time thinking of you both as Dadewethu\n[Sister], Mum, pal and mentor. What you perhaps don\u2019t know is how I often think and actually picture in my mind all that makes you up physically and spiritually \u2014 the loving remarks\nwhich came daily and the blind eye you\u2019ve always turned against those numerous irritations that would have frustrated another woman. . . . I even remember a day when you were\nbulging with Zindzi, struggling to cut your nails. I now recall those incidents with a sense of shame. I could have done it for you. Whether or not I was conscious of it, my attitude\nwas: I\u2019ve done my duty, a second brat is on the way, the difficulties you are now facing as a result of your physical condition are all yours. My only consolation is the knowledge that I\nthen led a life where I\u2019d hardly enough time even to think. Only I wonder what it\u2019ll be like when I return. . . .\nYour beautiful photo still stands about two feet above my left shoulder as I write this note. I dust it carefully every morning, for to do so gives me the pleasant feeling that I\u2019m\ncaressing you as in the old days. I even touch your nose with mine to recapture the electric current that used to flush through my blood whenever I did so. Nolitha stands on the\ntable directly opposite me. How can my spirits ever be down when I enjoy the fond attentions of such wonderful ladies.\n\nNolitha was the one person who was not a member of the family whose photo I kept. I revealed the secret of her identity to my daughter Zindzi in\nanother letter from .\nBy the way, has Mum ever told you about Nolitha, the other lady in my cell from the Andaman Islands? She keeps you, Zeni, Ndindi and Nandi, Mandla [these last three are\ngrandchildren], Maki and Mum company. It\u2019s one matter over which Mum\u2019s comments are surprisingly economic. She regards the pygmy beauty as some sort of rival and hardly\nsuspects that I took her picture out of the National Geographic.\n\nI thought continually of the day when I would walk free. Over and over, I fantasized about what I would like to do. This was one of the pleasantest\nways to pass the time. I put my daydreams on paper, again in .\nI wish I could drive you on a long, long journey just as I did on //, with the one difference that this time I\u2019d prefer us to be alone. I\u2019ve been away from you for so long that the very\nfirst thing I would like to do on my return would be to take you away from that suffocating atmosphere, drive you along carefully, so that you could have the opportunity of breathing\nfresh and clean air, seeing the beauty spots of South Africa, its green grass and trees, colourful wild flowers, sparkling streams, animals grazing in the veld and be able to talk to\nthe simple people we meet along the road. Our first stop would be to the place where Ma Radebe and CK [Winnie\u2019s mother and father] sleep. I hope they lie next to each other.\nThen I would be able to pay my respects to those who have made it possible for me to be as happy and free as I am now. Perhaps the stories I\u2019ve so much wanted to tell you all\nthese years would begin there. The atmosphere should probably sharpen your ears and restrain me to concentrate on those aspects which are tasty, edifying and constructive.\nThereafter, we would adjourn and resume next to Mphakanyiswa and Nosekeni [my parents] where the environment would be similar. I believe we would then be fresh and solid as\nwe drive back to .\n\nWhen the authorities began to allow us to receive photographs of immediate family members in the early s, Winnie sent me an album.\nWhenever I received a photograph of Winnie, the children, or the grandchildren, I would carefully paste it in. I cherished this album; it was the one\nway that I could see those I loved whenever I wanted.\nBut in prison no privilege comes without some accompanying impediment. Though I was permitted to receive pictures and to keep the album,\nwarders would often search my cell and confiscate pictures of Winnie. Eventually, however, the practice of seizing pictures ceased, and I built up my\nalbum so that it was thick with pictures of my entire family.\nI do not remember who first asked to borrow my photo album, but it was undoubtedly someone in my section. I happily loaned it, and someone\nelse asked, and then someone else. Soon it became so widely known that I possessed a photo album that I was receiving requests from men in F\nand G.\nThe men of F and G rarely received visitors or even letters, and it would have been ungenerous to deny them this window on the world. But before\nlong I found that my precious photo album was in tatters, and that many of my irreplaceable photographs had been removed. These men were\ndesperate to have something personal in their cells and could not help themselves. Each time this happened, I resolved to build up my album once\nmore.\nSometimes men would just ask me for a photograph rather than the album. I recall one day a young BC fellow from the general section who was\nbringing us food took me aside and said, \u201cMadiba, I would like a photograph.\u201d I said fine, I would send him one. \u201cWhen?\u201d he said rather brusquely. I\nreplied that I would try to send it that weekend. This seemed to satisfy him, and he began to walk away, but suddenly he turned round and said,\n\u201cLook, don\u2019t send me a photograph of the old lady. Send me one of the young girls, Zindzi or Zeni \u2014 remember, not the old lady!\u201d\n IN THEIR ANXIOUSNESS to deal with these young lions, the authorities more or less let us fend for ourselves. We were in the second year of a goslow strike at the quarry, demanding a complete end to all manual labor. Our requirement was for the right to do something useful with our days, like\nstudying or learning a trade. We no longer even went through the motions of working at the quarry; we simply talked among ourselves. In early ,\nthe authorities announced the end of manual labor. Instead, we could spend our days in our section. They arranged some type of work for us to do\nin the courtyard, but it was merely a fig leaf to hide their capitulation.\nThis victory was the combined result of our own unceasing protests and simple logistics. The authorities normally preferred to have a ratio of one\nwarder for every three prisoners. Even before the arrival of the post-Soweto prisoners, there was a shortage of warders, and the rebellious young\nmen required even greater supervision. They were so bold that each man seemed to require his own warder. If we remained in our section, we\nrequired less supervision.\n\nThe end of manual labor was liberating. I could now spend the day reading, writing letters, discussing issues with my comrades, or formulating legal\nbriefs. The free time allowed me to pursue what became two of my favorite hobbies on Robben Island: gardening and tennis.\nTo survive in prison, one must develop ways to take satisfaction in one\u2019s daily life. One can feel fulfilled by washing one\u2019s clothes so that they are\nparticularly clean, by sweeping a hallway so that it is empty of dust, by organizing one\u2019s cell to conserve as much space as possible. The same\npride one takes in more consequential tasks outside of prison one can find in doing small things inside prison.\nAlmost from the beginning of my sentence on Robben Island, I asked the authorities for permission to start a garden in the courtyard. For years,\nthey refused without offering a reason. But eventually they relented, and we were able to cut out a small garden on a narrow patch of earth against\nthe far wall.\nThe soil in the courtyard was dry and rocky. The courtyard had been constructed over a landfill, and in order to start my garden, I had to excavate\na great many rocks to allow the plants room to grow. At the time, some of my comrades jested that I was a miner at heart, for I spent my days at the\nquarry and my free time digging in the courtyard.\nThe authorities supplied me with seeds. I initially planted tomatoes, chilies, and onions \u2014 hardy plants that did not require rich earth or constant\ncare. The early harvests were poor, but they soon improved. The authorities did not regret giving permission, for once the garden began to flourish,\nI often provided the warders with some of my best tomatoes and onions.\nWhile I have always enjoyed gardening, it was not until I was behind bars that I was able to tend my own garden. My first experience in the garden\nwas at Fort Hare where, as part of the university\u2019s manual labor requirement, I worked in one of my professors\u2019 gardens and enjoyed the contact\nwith the soil as an antidote to my intellectual labors. Once I was in Johannesburg studying and then working, I had neither the time nor the space to\ncultivate a garden.\n\nI began to order books on gardening and horticulture. I studied different gardening techniques and types of fertilizer. I did not have many of the\nmaterials that the books discussed, but I learned through trial and error. For a time, I attempted to grow peanuts, and used different soils and\nfertilizers, but finally I gave up. It was one of my only failures.\nA garden was one of the few things in prison that one could control. To plant a seed, watch it grow, to tend it and then harvest it, offered a simple\nbut enduring satisfaction. The sense of being the custodian of this small patch of earth offered a small taste of freedom.\nIn some ways, I saw the garden as a metaphor for certain aspects of my life. A leader must also tend his garden; he, too, plants seeds, and then\nwatches, cultivates, and harvests the result. Like the gardener, a leader must take responsibility for what he cultivates; he must mind his work, try to\nrepel enemies, preserve what can be preserved, and eliminate what cannot succeed.\nI wrote Winnie two letters about a particularly beautiful tomato plant, how I coaxed it from a tender seedling to a robust plant that produced deep\nred fruit. But, then, either through some mistake or lack of care, the plant began to wither and decline, and nothing I did would bring it back to health.\nWhen it finally died, I removed the roots from the soil, washed them, and buried them in a corner of the garden.\nI narrated this small story at great length. I do not know what she read into that letter, but when I wrote it I had a mixture of feelings: I did not want\nour relationship to go the way of that plant, and yet I felt that I had been unable to nourish many of the most important relationships in my life.\nSometimes there is nothing one can do to save something that must die.\n\nOne unanticipated result of ending manual labor was that I began to gain weight. Though we were doing barely enough labor at the quarry to work\nup a sweat, the walk there and back was enough to keep me trim.\nI have always believed that exercise is not only a key to physical health but to peace of mind. Many times in the old days I unleashed my anger\nand frustration on a punching bag rather than taking it out on a comrade or even a policeman. Exercise dissipates tension, and tension is the\nenemy of serenity. I found that I worked better and thought more clearly when I was in good physical condition, and so training became one of the\ninflexible disciplines of my life. In prison, having an outlet for one\u2019s frustrations was absolutely essential.\nEven on the island, I attempted to follow my old boxing routine of doing roadwork and muscle-building from Monday through Thursday and then\nresting for the next three days. On Monday through Thursday, I would do stationary running in my cell in the morning for up to forty-five minutes. I\nwould also perform one hundred fingertip push-ups, two hundred sit-ups, fifty deep kneebends, and various other calisthenics.\nIn my letters to my children, I regularly urged them to exercise, to play some fast-moving sport like basketball, soccer, or tennis to take their mind\noff whatever might be bothering them. While I was not always successful with my children, I did manage to influence some of my more sedentary\ncolleagues. Exercise was unusual for African men of my age and generation. After a while, even Walter began to take a few turns around the\ncourtyard in the morning. I know that some of my younger comrades looked at me and said to themselves, \u201cIf that old man can do it, why can\u2019t I?\u201d\nThey too began to exercise.\n\nFrom the very first meetings I had with outside visitors and the International Red Cross, I stressed the importance of having the time and facilities for\nproper exercise. Only in the mid-s, under the auspices of the International Red Cross, did we begin to receive things like volleyball equipment\n\n\fand a Ping-Pong table.\nAt roughly the same time we finished working at the quarry, one of the warders had the idea of converting our courtyard into a tennis court. Its\ndimensions were perfect. Prisoners from the general section painted the cement surface green and then fashioned the traditional configuration of\nwhite lines. A few days later a net was put up and suddenly we had our own Wimbledon in our front yard.\nI had played a bit of tennis when I was at Fort Hare, but I was by no means an expert. My forehand was relatively strong, my backhand regrettably\nweak. But I pursued the sport for exercise, not style; it was the best and only replacement for the walks to and from the quarry. I was one of the first\nin our section to play regularly. I was a back-court player, only rushing the net when I had a clean slam.\n\nOnce manual labor ended, I had much more time for reading, but the books I had been using were now out-of-bounds. When my studies were\ncanceled, I was still in the midst of pursuing my LL.B. at the University of London. I had started studying for the LL.B. during the Rivonia Trial and the\nsuspension of study privileges for four years would undoubtedly assure me of the university record for the most number of years pursuing that\ndegree.\nBut the suspension of study privileges had an unintended benefit, and that was that I began to read books that I would not otherwise have read.\nInstead of poring over tomes about contract law, I was now absorbed by novels.\nI did not have an unlimited library to choose from on Robben Island. We had access to many unremembered mysteries and detective novels and\nall the works of Daphne du Maurier, but little more. Political books were off-limits. Any book about socialism or communism was definitely out. A\nrequest for a book with the word red in the title, even if it was Little Red Riding Hood, would be rejected by the censors. War of the Worlds by H. G.\nWells, though it is a work of science fiction, would be turned down because the word war appeared in its title.\nFrom the first, I tried to read books about South Africa or by South African writers. I read all the unbanned novels of Nadine Gordimer and learned\na great deal about the white liberal sensibility. I read many American novels, and recall especially John Steinbeck\u2019s The Grapes of Wrath, in which I\nfound many similarities between the plight of the migrant workers in that novel and our own laborers and farmworkers.\nOne book that I returned to many times was Tolstoy\u2019s great work, War and Peace. (Although the word war was in the title, this book was\npermitted.) I was particularly taken with the portrait of General Kutuzov, whom everyone at the Russian court underestimated. Kutuzov defeated\nNapoleon precisely because he was not swayed by the ephemeral and superficial values of the court, and made his decisions on a visceral\nunderstanding of his men and his people. It reminded me once again that to truly lead one\u2019s people one must also truly know them. IN THE WAKE of the Soweto student uprising, I learned that Winnie, along with my old friend and physician, Dr. Nthato Motlana, had become\ninvolved with the Black Parents Association, an organization of concerned local professionals and church leaders who acted as a guiding hand and\nintermediary for the students. The authorities seemed to be as wary of the parents association as of the young rebels. In August, less than two\nmonths after the student revolt, Winnie was detained under the Internal Security Act and imprisoned without charge in the Fort in Johannesburg,\nwhere she was held for five months. During that time, I was able to write to her and my daughters, who were at boarding school in Swaziland,\nexpressing support and solidarity. I was greatly distressed by her imprisonment, though she was apparently not mistreated this time and emerged\nfrom jail in December even firmer in her commitment to the struggle.\nThough banned, Winnie picked up where she left off, and the authorities were dismayed about her popularity with the young radicals of Soweto.\nThey were determined to lessen her influence and did it with a brazen and shameless act: they sent her into internal exile. On the night of May ,\n, police cars and a truck pulled up outside of the house in Orlando West and began loading furniture and clothing into the back of the truck.\nThis time Winnie was not being arrested, or detained, or interrogated; she was being banished to a remote township in the Free State called\nBrandfort. I discovered the details from Kathy, who had been given the information from a visiting Hindu priest.\nBrandfort is about two hundred fifty miles southwest of Johannesburg, just north of Bloemfontein, in the Free State. After a long and rough ride,\nWinnie, Zindzi, and all their possessions were dumped in front of a three-room tin-roofed shack in Brandfort\u2019s bleak African township, a desperately\npoor and backward place where the people were under the thumb of the local white farmers. Winnie was regarded with wariness and trepidation.\nThe local language was Sesotho, which Winnie did not speak.\nHer new circumstances saddened and angered me. At least when she was home in Soweto, I could picture her cooking in the kitchen or reading\nin the lounge, I could imagine her waking up in the house I knew so well. That was a source of comfort to me. In Soweto, even if she was banned,\nthere were friends and family nearby. In Brandfort she and Zindzi would be alone.\nI had passed through this township once on my way to Bloemfontein, and took no notice of it. There was nothing memorable in its all too typical\npoverty and desolateness. I did not know at the time how familiar the address \u2014 house number , Brandfort \u2014 would one day become to me.\nOnce again, I felt as though Winnie and I were in prison at the same time.\n\nLife in Brandfort was hard, as I learned from Winnie\u2019s letters. They had no heat, no toilet, no running water. The township had no shops and the\nstores in town were hostile to African customers. The whites for the most part were Afrikaans-speaking and deeply conservative.\nWinnie and Zindzi were under constant police surveillance and intermittent harassment. Within a few months Zindzi \u2014 who was not banned \u2014\nwas upset by the security police\u2019s intimidation. In September, with the help of Winnie\u2019s lawyers, I brought an urgent application for an interdict\nagainst the local Brandfort security police to restrain them from harassing my daughter. Affidavits filed before the judge described policemen\nbursting into the house and threatening Zindzi. The judge ruled that Zindzi could receive visitors in peace.\nWinnie is a resilient person, and within a relatively short time, she had won over the people of the township, including some sympathetic whites in\nthe vicinity. She supplied food to the people in the township with the help of Operation Hunger, started a cr\u00e8che or nursery school for the township\u2019s\nchildren, and raised funds to create a medical clinic in a place where few people had ever seen a doctor.\n\nIn , Zeni, my second-youngest daughter and my first child with Winnie, married Prince Thumbumuzi, a son of King Sobhuza of Swaziland. They\nhad met while Zeni was away at school. Being in prison, I was not able to fulfill the father\u2019s traditional duties. In our culture, the father of the bride\nmust interview the prospective groom and assess his prospects. He must also determine lobola, the bride-price, which is paid by the groom to the\nbride\u2019s family. On the wedding day itself, the father gives away his daughter. Although I had no doubts about the young man, I asked my friend and\nlegal adviser George Bizos to be a stand-in for me. I instructed George to interview the prince about how he intended to look after my daughter.\nGeorge met with the prince in his office and then arranged to consult with me on Robben Island. Because Zeni was under twenty-one years of\nage, it was necessary for me to give my legal consent for her to marry. I met George in the consulting room and he was surprised to find a warder in\nthe consulting room with us. I explained that this was according to regulations because this was considered a family visit not a legal one. I jestingly\nreassured George by saying that I had no secrets from my guards.\nGeorge reported how much the two children loved one another and the bright prospects of my future son-in-law. His father, King Sobhuza, was an\nenlightened traditional leader and also a member of the ANC. As George relayed to me some of the requirements made by the young man\u2019s family,\nhe was at pains to point out that the boy was a Swazi prince. I told George to tell the young man that he was getting a Thembu princess.\n\nThere was a tremendous advantage in Zeni\u2019s becoming a member of the Swazi royal family: she was immediately granted diplomatic privileges\nand could visit me virtually at will. That winter, after she and Thumbumuzi were married, they came to see me, along with their newborn baby\ndaughter. Because of the prince\u2019s status, we were allowed to meet one another in the consulting room, not the normal visiting area where one is\nseparated from one\u2019s family by thick walls and glass. I waited for them with some nervousness.\nIt was a truly wondrous moment when they came into the room. I stood up, and when Zeni saw me, she practically tossed her tiny daughter to her\nhusband and ran across the room to embrace me. I had not held my now-grown daughter virtually since she was about her own daughter\u2019s age. It\nwas a dizzying experience, as though time had sped forward in a science fiction novel, to suddenly hug one\u2019s fully grown child. I then embraced my\nnew son and he handed me my tiny granddaughter whom I did not let go of for the entire visit. To hold a newborn baby, so vulnerable and soft in my\nrough hands, hands that for too long had held only picks and shovels, was a profound joy. I don\u2019t think a man was ever happier to hold a baby than I\nwas that day.\nThe visit had a more official purpose and that was for me to choose a name for the child. It is a custom for the grandfather to select a name, and\nthe one I had chosen was Zaziwe \u2014 which means \u201cHope.\u201d The name had special meaning for me, for during all my years in prison hope never left\nme \u2014 and now it never would. I was convinced that this child would be a part of a new generation of South Africans for whom apartheid would be a\ndistant memory \u2014 that was my dream.",
    "1981-1987": " LIKE MY FATHER BEFORE ME, I had been groomed to be a counselor to the king of the Thembu. Although I had chosen a different path, I tried in\nmy own fashion to live up to the responsibilities of the role for which I had been schooled. From prison, I did my best to remain in contact with the\nking and advise him as best I could. As I grew older, my thoughts turned more and more often to the green hills of the Transkei. Although I would\nnever move there under the government\u2019s auspices, I dreamed of one day returning to a free Transkei. Thus, it was with great dismay that I learned\nin  that the king, Sabata Dalindyebo, the paramount chief of the Thembu, had been deposed by my nephew, K. D. Matanzima, the prime\nminister of the Transkei.\nA group of Thembu chiefs requested an urgent visit with me, which was approved by the authorities, who were usually willing to countenance\nvisits by traditional leaders \u2014 believing that the more involved I was in tribal and Transkei matters, the less committed I would be to the struggle.\nThe government promoted the power of traditional leaders as a counterpoint to the ANC. While many of my comrades thought we should\ndisavow those leaders, my inclination was to reach out to them. There is no contradiction between being a traditional leader and a member of the\nANC. This spurred one of the longest and most delicate debates we had on the island: whether or not the ANC should participate in governmentsponsored institutions. Many of the men considered this collaborationist. Once again, I thought it necessary to draw a distinction between principle\nand tactics. To me, the critical question was a tactical one: Will our organization emerge stronger through participating in these organizations or by\nboycotting them? In this case, I thought we would emerge stronger by participating.\n\nI met with the chiefs in a large room in the visiting area, and they explained their dilemma. Although their hearts were with Sabata, they feared\nMatanzima. After listening to their presentation, I advised them to throw their support to Sabata against Matanzima, who was illegally and\nshamefully usurping power from the king. I sympathized with their situation, but I could not condone Matanzima\u2019s actions. I asked them to convey my\nsupport to Sabata and my disapproval to Matanzima.\nMatanzima had also proposed a visit to discuss Sabata and family matters. As my nephew, he had actually been requesting such a visit for a\nnumber of years. Although Matanzima claimed to want to discuss family matters, such a visit would have political consequences. From the moment\nof Matanzima\u2019s first request, I referred the matter to the High Organ and the ANC men in our section. Some simply shrugged their shoulders and\nsaid, \u201cHe\u2019s your nephew; he has a right to visit.\u201d Raymond, Govan, and Kathy, however, insisted that although such a visit could be explained away\nas a family matter, it would be interpreted by many people inside and outside as a sign of my endorsement of the man and his policies. That was\nthe reason why Matanzima wanted to visit, and the reason such a visit was unacceptable.\nI understood and in large part agreed with their arguments, but I wanted to meet with my nephew. I have always had perhaps too high a regard for\nthe importance of face-to-face meetings and of my own ability in such a meeting to persuade men to change their views. I was hoping I could\nconvince Matanzima to modify his policies.\nEventually, the ANC men in our section decided not to object to a visit. In the interests of democracy, we then consulted with our men in F and G\non the matter, and they were adamantly opposed. Steve Tshwete, who was one of the leading ANC figures in the general section, said such a visit\nwould help Matanzima politically and was therefore out of the question. Many of them noted that Matanzima had already tried to coopt my approval\nby making Winnie\u2019s father, Columbus Madikizela, the minister of agriculture in his government. This was bad enough, they said, without Madiba\nagreeing to see him. I bowed to the views of the membership in the general section and regretfully informed the authorities that I would not accept a\nvisit from my nephew.\n\nIn March of , I was told by the prison authorities that my wife had been in a car accident, and that she was in hospital. They had very little\ninformation, and I had no idea of her condition or what her circumstances were. I accused the authorities of holding back information, and I made an\nurgent application for my attorney to visit me. The authorities used information as a weapon, and it was a successful one. I was preoccupied with\nmy wife\u2019s health until I was visited on March  by Winnie\u2019s attorney and my friend Dullah Omar.\nDullah quickly eased my mind about Winnie. She had been in a car that overturned but she was all right. Our visit was brief, and as I was led back\nto Section B my mind was still dwelling on Winnie, and I was plagued by the feeling of powerlessness and my inability to help her.\nI had not been in my cell long when I was visited by the commanding officer and a number of other prison officials. This was highly unusual; the\ncommanding officer did not generally pay calls on prisoners in their cells. I stood up when they arrived, and the commander actually entered my cell.\nThere was barely room for the two of us.\n\u201cMandela,\u201d he said, \u201cI want you to pack up your things.\u201d\nI asked him why.\n\u201cWe are transferring you,\u201d he said simply.\nWhere?\n\u201cI cannot say,\u201d he replied.\nI demanded to know why. He told me only that he had received instructions from Pretoria that I was to be transferred off the island immediately.\nThe commanding officer left and went in turn to the cells of Walter, Raymond Mhlaba, and Andrew Mlangeni and gave them the same order.\n\nI was disturbed and unsettled. What did it mean? Where were we going? In prison, one can only question and resist an order to a certain point, then\none must succumb. We had no warning, no preparation. I had been on the island for over eighteen years, and to leave so abruptly?\nWe were each given several large cardboard boxes in which to pack our things. Everything that I had accumulated in nearly two decades could fit\nin these few boxes. We packed in little more than half an hour.\nThere was a commotion in the corridor when the other men learned we were leaving, but we had no time to say a proper goodbye to our\ncomrades of many years. This is another one of the indignities of prison. The bonds of friendship and loyalty with other prisoners count for nothing\nwith the authorities.\nWithin minutes we were on board the ferry headed for Cape Town. I looked back at the island as the light was fading, not knowing whether or not\nI would ever see it again. A man can get used to anything, and I had grown used to Robben Island. I had lived there for almost two decades and\nwhile it was never a home \u2014 my home was in Johannesburg \u2014 it had become a place where I felt comfortable. I have always found change difficult,\n\n\fand leaving Robben Island, however grim it had been at times, was no exception. I had no idea what to look forward to.\nAt the docks, surrounded by armed guards, we were hustled into a windowless truck. The four of us stood in the dark while the truck drove for\nwhat seemed considerably longer than an hour. We passed through various checkpoints, and finally came to a stop. The back doors swung open,\nand in the dark we were marched up some concrete steps and through metal doors into another security facility. I managed to ask a guard where\nwe were.\n\u201cPollsmoor Prison,\u201d he said. \n\f\f\f\nPOLLSMOOR MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON is located on the edge of a prosperous white suburb of green lawns and tidy houses called Tokai, a\nfew miles southeast of Cape Town. The prison itself is set amidst the strikingly beautiful scenery of the Cape, between the mountains of\nConstantiaberge to the north and hundreds of acres of vineyards to the south. But this natural beauty was invisible to us behind Pollsmoor\u2019s high\nconcrete walls. At Pollsmoor I first understood the truth of Oscar Wilde\u2019s haunting line about the tent of blue that prisoners call the sky.\nPollsmoor had a modern face but a primitive heart. The buildings, particularly the ones for the prison staff, were clean and contemporary; but the\nhousing for the prisoners was archaic and dirty. With the exception of ourselves, all men at Pollsmoor were common-law prisoners, and their\ntreatment was backward. We were kept separately from them and treated differently.\nIt was not until the next morning that we got a proper sense of our surroundings. The four of us had been given what was in effect the prison\u2019s\npenthouse: a spacious room on the third and topmost floor of the prison. We were the only prisoners on the entire floor. The main room was clean,\nmodern, and rectangular, about fifty feet by thirty, and had a separate section with a toilet, urinal, two sinks, and two showers. There were four\nproper beds, with sheets, and towels, a great luxury for men who had spent much of the last eighteen years sleeping on thin mats on a stone floor.\nCompared to Robben Island, we were in a five-star hotel.\nWe also had our own L-shaped terrace, an open, outdoor section that was as long as half a soccer field, where we were allowed out during the\nday. It had white concrete walls about twelve feet high, so that we could see only the sky, except in one corner where we could make out the ridges\nof the Constantiaberge mountains, in particular a section known as the Elephant\u2019s Eye. I sometimes thought of this bit of mountain as the tip of the\niceberg of the rest of the world.\nIt was greatly disorienting to be uprooted so suddenly and without explanation. One must be prepared for precipitate movements in prison, but\none does not ever get used to them. Though we were now on the mainland, we felt more isolated. For us, the island had become the locus of the\nstruggle. We took solace in each other\u2019s company, and spent those early weeks speculating on why we had been transferred. We knew the\nauthorities had long resented and feared the influence we had on younger prisoners. But the reason seemed to be more strategic: we believed the\nauthorities were attempting to cut off the head of the ANC on the island by removing its leadership. Robben Island itself was becoming a sustaining\nmyth in the struggle, and they wanted to rob it of some of its symbolic import by removing us. Walter, Raymond, and I were members of the High\nOrgan, but the one piece that did not fit was the presence of Mlangeni. Andrew was not a member of the High Organ and had not been in the\nforefront of the island leadership, although we considered the possibility that the authorities did not know this. Their intelligence about the\norganization was often inexact.\nOne of our hypotheses seemed to be confirmed a few months later when we were joined by Kathy, who had indeed been a member of the High\nOrgan. More important, Kathy had been our chief of communications, and it was because of his work that we were able to communicate with new\nyoung prisoners.\nA few weeks after Kathy arrived, we were also joined by a man we did not know who had not even come from Robben Island. Patrick Maqubela\nwas a young lawyer and ANC member from the eastern Cape. He had been articled to Griffiths Mxenge, a highly respected attorney who had\nappeared for many detained ANC men and who had been assassinated near Durban the year before. Maqubela was serving a twenty-year\nsentence for treason and had been transferred to Pollsmoor from Diepkloof in Johannesburg, where he had made waves by organizing prisoners.\nAt first, we were skeptical of this new arrival, and wondered if he could perhaps be a security plant by the authorities. But we soon saw that this\nwas not the case. Patrick was a bright, amiable, undaunted fellow with whom we got along very well. It could not have been easy for him bunking in\nwith a group of old men set in their ways who had been together for the previous two decades.\n* * *\nWe were now in a world of concrete. I missed the natural splendor of Robben Island. But our new home had many consolations. For one thing, the\nfood at Pollsmoor was far superior; after years of eating pap three meals a day, Pollsmoor\u2019s dinners of proper meat and vegetables were like a\nfeast. We were permitted a fairly wide range of newspapers and magazines, and could receive such previously contraband publications as Time\nmagazine and The Guardian weekly from London. This gave us a window on the wider world. We also had a radio, but one that received only local\nstations, not what we really wanted: the BBC World Service. We were allowed out on our terrace all day long, except between twelve and two when\nthe warders had their lunch. There was not even a pretense that we had to work. I had a small cell near our large one that functioned as a study, with\na chair, desk, and bookshelves, where I could read and write during the day.\nOn Robben Island I would do my exercises in my own cramped cell, but now I had room to stretch out. At Pollsmoor, I would wake up at five and\ndo an hour and a half of exercise in our communal cell. I did my usual regimen of stationary running, skipping rope, sit-ups, and fingertip press-ups.\nMy comrades were not early risers and my program soon made me a very unpopular fellow in our cell.\nI was visited by Winnie shortly after arriving at Pollsmoor and was pleased to find that the visiting area was far better and more modern than the\none on Robben Island. We had a large glass barrier through which one could see the visitor from the waist up and far more sophisticated\nmicrophones so that we did not have to strain to hear. The window gave at least the illusion of greater intimacy, and in prison, illusions can offer\ncomfort.\nIt was far easier for my wife and family to get to Pollsmoor than Robben Island, and this made a tremendous difference. The supervision of visits\nalso became more humane. Often, Winnie\u2019s visits were overseen by Warrant Officer James Gregory, who had been a censor on Robben Island. I\nhad not known him terribly well, but he knew us, because he had been responsible for reviewing our incoming and outgoing mail.\nAt Pollsmoor I got to know Gregory better and found him a welcome contrast to the typical warder. He was polished and soft-spoken, and treated\nWinnie with courtesy and deference. Instead of barking, \u201cTime up!\u201d he would say, \u201cMrs. Mandela, you have five more minutes.\u201d\n\nThe Bible tells us that gardens preceded gardeners, but that was not the case at Pollsmoor, where I cultivated a garden that became one of my\nhappiest diversions. It was my way of escaping from the monolithic concrete world that surrounded us. Within a few weeks of surveying all the\nempty space we had on the building\u2019s roof and how it was bathed in sun the whole day, I decided to start a garden and received permission to do\nso from the commanding officer. I requested that the prison service supply me with sixteen -gallon oil drums that I had them slice in half. The\nauthorities then filled each half with rich, moist soil, creating in effect thirty-two giant flowerpots.\nI grew onions, eggplant, cabbage, cauliflower, beans, spinach, carrots, cucumbers, broccoli, beetroot, lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, strawberries,\nand much more. At its height, I had a small farm with nearly nine hundred plants; a garden far grander than the one I had on Robben Island.\n\n\fSome of the seeds I purchased and some \u2014 for example, broccoli and carrots \u2014 were given to me by the commanding officer, Brigadier Munro,\nwho was particularly fond of these vegetables. Warders also gave me seeds of vegetables they liked, and I was supplied with excellent manure to\nuse as fertilizer.\nEach morning, I put on a straw hat and rough gloves and worked in the garden for two hours. Every Sunday, I would supply vegetables to the\nkitchen so that they could cook a special meal for the common-law prisoners. I also gave quite a lot of my harvest to the warders, who used to bring\nsatchels to take away their fresh vegetables.\n\nAt Pollsmoor, our problems tended to be less consequential than those we experienced on Robben Island. Brigadier Munro was a decent, helpful\nman, who took extra pains to make sure we had what we wanted. Nevertheless, small problems sometimes got blown out of proportion. In ,\nduring a visit with Winnie and Zindzi, I mentioned to my wife that I had been given shoes that were a size too small and were pinching my toe.\nWinnie was concerned, and I soon learned that there were press reports that I was having a toe amputated. Because of the difficulty of\ncommunication, information from prison often becomes exaggerated in the outside world. If I had simply been able to telephone my wife and tell her\nthat my foot was fine, such confusion would not have happened. A short while later, Helen Suzman was permitted to visit, and she inquired about my\ntoe. I thought the best answer was a demonstration: I took off my socks, held my bare foot up to the glass, and wiggled my toes.\nWe complained about the dampness in our cell, which was causing us to catch colds. Later, I heard reports that South African newspapers were\nwriting that our cell was flooded. We asked for contact with other prisoners, and in general made the same basic complaint that we always had: to\nbe treated as political prisoners.\nIn May of , I found some consolation that seemed to make up for all the discomforts. At a scheduled visit from Winnie, Zeni, and her\nyoungest daughter, I was escorted down to the visiting area by Sergeant Gregory, who instead of taking me to the normal visiting area, ushered me\ninto a separate room where there was only a small table, and no dividers of any kind. He very softly said to me that the authorities had made a\nchange. That day was the beginning of what were known as \u201ccontact\u201d visits.\nHe then went outside to see my wife and daughter and asked to speak to Winnie privately. Winnie actually got a fright when Gregory took her\naside, thinking that I was perhaps ill. But Gregory escorted her around the door and before either of us knew it, we were in the same room and in\neach other\u2019s arms. I kissed and held my wife for the first time in all these many years. It was a moment I had dreamed about a thousand times. It\nwas as if I were still dreaming. I held her to me for what seemed like an eternity. We were still and silent except for the sound of our hearts. I did not\nwant to let go of her at all, but I broke free and embraced my daughter and then took her child into my lap. It had been twenty-one years since I had\neven touched my wife\u2019s hand. AT POLLSMOOR, we were more connected to outside events. We were aware that the struggle was intensifying, and that the efforts of the enemy\nwere similarly increasing. In , the South African Defense Force launched a raid on ANC offices in Maputo, Mozambique, killing thirteen of our\npeople, including women and children. In December , MK set off explosions at the unfinished Koeberg nuclear power plant outside Cape\nTown and placed bombs at many other military and apartheid targets around the country. That same month, the South African military again\nattacked an ANC outpost in Maseru, Lesotho, killing forty-two people, including a dozen women and children.\nIn August of , activist Ruth First was opening her mail in Maputo, where she was living in exile, when she was murdered by a letter bomb.\nRuth, the wife of Joe Slovo, was a brave anti-apartheid activist who had spent a number of months in prison. She was a forceful, engaging woman\nwhom I first met when I was studying at Wits, and her death revealed the extent of the state\u2019s cruelty in combating our struggle.\nMK\u2019s first car bomb attack took place in May of , and was aimed at an air force and military intelligence office in the heart of Pretoria. This\nwas an effort to retaliate for the unprovoked attacks the military had launched on the ANC in Maseru and elsewhere and was a clear escalation of\nthe armed struggle. Nineteen people were killed and more than two hundred injured.\nThe killing of civilians was a tragic accident, and I felt a profound horror at the death toll. But as disturbed as I was by these casualties, I knew that\nsuch accidents were the inevitable consequence of the decision to embark on a military struggle. Human fallibility is always a part of war, and the\nprice for it is always high. It was precisely because we knew that such incidents would occur that our decision to take up arms had been so grave\nand reluctant. But as Oliver said at the time of the bombing, the armed struggle was imposed upon us by the violence of the apartheid regime.\nBoth the government and the ANC were working on two tracks: military and political. On the political front, the government was pursuing its\nstandard divide-and-rule strategy in attempting to separate Africans from Coloureds and Indians. In a referendum of November , the white\nelectorate endorsed P. W. Botha\u2019s plan to create a so-called tricameral Parliament, with Indian and Coloured chambers in addition to the white\nParliament. This was an effort to lure Indians and Coloureds into the system, and divide them from Africans. But the offer was merely a \u201ctoy\ntelephone,\u201d as all parliamentary action by Indians and Coloureds was subject to a white veto. It was also a way of fooling the outside world into\nthinking that the government was reforming apartheid. Botha\u2019s ruse did not fool the people, as more than  percent of eligible Indian and Coloured\nvoters boycotted the election to the new houses of Parliament in .\nPowerful grassroots political movements were being formed inside the country that had firm links to the ANC, the principal one being the United\nDemocratic Front, of which I was named a patron. The UDF had been created to coordinate protest against the new apartheid constitution in ,\nand the first elections to the segregated tricameral Parliament in . The UDF soon blossomed into a powerful organization that united over six\nhundred anti-apartheid organizations \u2014 trade unions, community groups, church groups, student associations.\nThe ANC was experiencing a new birth of popularity. Opinion polls showed that the Congress was far and away the most popular political\norganization among Africans even though it had been banned for a quarter of a century. The anti-apartheid struggle as a whole had captured the\nattention of the world; in , Bishop Desmond Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. (The authorities refused to send Bishop Tutu my letter\nof congratulations.) The South African government was under growing international pressure, as nations all across the globe began to impose\neconomic sanctions on Pretoria.\n\nThe government had sent \u201cfeelers\u201d to me over the years, beginning with Minister Kruger\u2019s efforts to persuade me to move to the Transkei. These\nwere not efforts to negotiate, but attempts to isolate me from my organization. On several other occasions, Kruger said to me: \u201cMandela, we can\nwork with you, but not your colleagues. Be reasonable.\u201d Although I did not respond to these overtures, the mere fact that they were talking rather\nthan attacking could be seen as a prelude to genuine negotiations.\nThe government was testing the waters. In late  and early , I had visits from two prominent Western statesmen, Lord Nicholas Bethell, a\nmember of the British House of Lords and the European Parliament, and Samuel Dash, a professor of law at Georgetown University and a former\ncounsel to the U.S. Senate Watergate Committee. Both visits were authorized by the new minister of justice, Kobie Coetsee, who appeared to be\na new sort of Afrikaner leader.\nI met Lord Bethell in the prison commander\u2019s office, which was dominated by a large photograph of a glowering President Botha. Bethell was a\njovial, rotund man and when I first met him, I teased him about his stoutness. \u201cYou look like you are related to Winston Churchill,\u201d I said as we shook\nhands, and he laughed.\nLord Bethell wanted to know about our conditions at Pollsmoor and I told him. We discussed the armed struggle and I explained to him it was not\nup to us to renounce violence, but the government. I reaffirmed that we aimed for hard military targets, not people. \u201cI would not want our men to\nassassinate, for instance, the major here,\u201d I said, pointing to Major Fritz van Sittert, who was monitoring the talks. Van Sittert was a good-natured\nfellow who did not say much, but he started at my remark.\nIn my visit with Professor Dash, which quickly followed that of Lord Bethell, I laid out what I saw as the minimum for a future nonracial South Africa:\na unitary state without homelands; nonracial elections for the central Parliament; and one-person-one-vote. Professor Dash asked me whether I\ntook any encouragement from the government\u2019s stated intention of repealing the mixed-marriage laws and certain other apartheid statutes. \u201cThis is\na pinprick,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is not my ambition to marry a white woman or swim in a white pool. It is political equality that we want.\u201d I told Dash quite\ncandidly that at the moment we could not defeat the government on the battlefield, but could make governing difficult for them.\nI had one not-so-pleasant visit from two Americans, editors of the conservative newspaper the Washington Times. They seemed less intent on\nfinding out my views than on proving that I was a Communist and a terrorist. All of their questions were slanted in that direction, and when I\nreiterated that I was neither a Communist nor a terrorist, they attempted to show that I was not a Christian either by asserting that the Reverend\nMartin Luther King never resorted to violence. I told them that the conditions in which Martin Luther King struggled were totally different from my own:\nthe United States was a democracy with constitutional guarantees of equal rights that protected nonviolent protest (though there was still prejudice\nagainst blacks); South Africa was a police state with a constitution that enshrined inequality and an army that responded to nonviolence with force. I\ntold them that I was a Christian and had always been a Christian. Even Christ, I said, when he was left with no alternative, used force to expel the\nmoneylenders from the temple. He was not a man of violence, but had no choice but to use force against evil. I do not think I persuaded them.\n\nFaced with trouble at home and pressure from abroad, P. W. Botha offered a tepid, halfway measure. On January , , in a debate in\nParliament, the state president publicly offered me my freedom if I \u201cunconditionally rejected violence as a political instrument.\u201d This offer was\n\n\fextended to all political prisoners. Then, as if he were staking me to a public challenge, he added, \u201cIt is therefore not the South Africa government\nwhich now stands in the way of Mr. Mandela\u2019s freedom. It is he himself.\u201d\nI had been warned by the authorities that the government was going to make a proposal involving my freedom, but I had not been prepared for\nthe fact that it would be made in Parliament by the state president. By my reckoning, it was the sixth conditional offer the government had made for\nmy release in the past ten years. After I listened to the speech on radio, I made a request to the commander of the prison for an urgent visit by my\nwife and my lawyer, Ismail Ayob, so that I could dictate my response to the state president\u2019s offer.\nWinnie and Ismail were not given permission to visit for a week, and in the meantime I wrote a letter to the foreign minister, Pik Botha, rejecting\nthe conditions for my release, while also preparing a public response. I was keen to do a number of things in this response, because Botha\u2019s offer\nwas an attempt to drive a wedge between me and my colleagues by tempting me to accept a policy the ANC rejected. I wanted to reassure the\nANC in general and Oliver in particular that my loyalty to the organization was beyond question. I also wished to send a message to the government\nthat while I rejected its offer because of the conditions attached to it, I nevertheless thought negotiation, not war, was the path to a solution.\nBotha wanted the onus of violence to rest on my shoulders and I wanted to reaffirm to the world that we were only responding to the violence done\nto us. I intended to make it clear that if I emerged from prison into the same circumstances in which I was arrested, I would be forced to resume the\nsame activities for which I was arrested.\nI met with Winnie and Ismail on a Friday; on Sunday, a UDF rally was to be held in Soweto\u2019s Jabulani Stadium, where my response would be\nmade public. Some guards with whom I was not familiar supervised the visit, and as we began discussing my response to the state president, one\nof the warders, a relatively young fellow, interrupted to say that only family matters were permitted to be discussed. I ignored him, and he returned\nminutes later with a senior warder whom I barely knew. This warder said that I must cease discussing politics, and I told him that I was dealing with\na matter of national importance involving an offer from the state president. I warned him that if he wanted to halt the discussion he must get direct\norders from the state president himself. \u201cIf you are not willing to telephone the state president to get those orders,\u201d I said coldly, \u201cthen kindly do not\ninterrupt us again.\u201d He did not.\nI gave Ismail and Winnie the speech I had prepared. In addition to responding to the government, I wanted to thank publicly the UDF for its fine\nwork and to congratulate Bishop Tutu on his prize, adding that his award belonged to all the people. On Sunday, February , , my daughter\nZindzi read my response to a cheering crowd of people who had not been able to hear my words legally anywhere in South Africa for more than\ntwenty years.\nZindzi was a dynamic speaker like her mother, and said that her father should be at the stadium to speak the words himself. I was proud to know\nthat it was she who spoke my words.\nI am a member of the African National Congress. I have always been a member of the African National Congress and I will remain a member of the African National Congress until\nthe day I die. Oliver Tambo is more than a brother to me. He is my greatest friend and comrade for nearly fifty years. If there is any one amongst you who cherishes my freedom,\nOliver Tambo cherishes it more, and I know that he would give his life to see me free. . . .\nI am surprised at the conditions that the government wants to impose on me. I am not a violent man. . . . It was only then, when all other forms of resistance were no longer open\nto us, that we turned to armed struggle. Let Botha show that he is different to Malan, Strijdom and Verwoerd. Let him renounce violence. Let him say that he will dismantle\napartheid. Let him unban the people\u2019s organization, the African National Congress. Let him free all who have been imprisoned, banished or exiled for their opposition to apartheid.\nLet him guarantee free political activity so that people may decide who will govern them.\nI cherish my own freedom dearly, but I care even more for your freedom. Too many have died since I went to prison. Too many have suffered for the love of freedom. I owe it to\ntheir widows, to their orphans, to their mothers, and to their fathers who have grieved and wept for them. Not only I have suffered during these long, lonely, wasted years. I am not\nless life-loving than you are. But I cannot sell my birthright, nor am I prepared to sell the birthright of the people to be free. . . .\nWhat freedom am I being offered while the organization of the people remains banned? What freedom am I being offered when I may be arrested on a pass offense? What\nfreedom am I being offered to live my life as a family with my dear wife who remains in banishment in Brandfort? What freedom am I being offered when I must ask for permission\nto live in an urban area? . . . What freedom am I being offered when my very South African citizenship is not respected?\nOnly free men can negotiate. Prisoners cannot enter into contracts. . . . I cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom\nand mine cannot be separated. I will return.\n IN  after a routine medical examination with the prison doctor, I was referred to a urologist, who diagnosed an enlarged prostate gland and\nrecommended surgery. He said the procedure was routine. I consulted with my family and decided to go ahead with the operation.\nI was taken to Volks Hospital in Cape Town, under heavy security. Winnie flew down and was able to see me prior to the surgery. But I had\nanother visitor, a surprising and unexpected one: Kobie Coetsee, the minister of justice. Not long before, I had written to Coetsee pressing him for\na meeting to discuss talks between the ANC and the government. He did not respond. But that morning, the minister dropped by the hospital\nunannounced as if he were visiting an old friend who was laid up for a few days. He was altogether gracious and cordial, and for the most part we\nsimply made pleasantries. Though I acted as though this was the most normal thing in the world, I was amazed. The government, in its slow and\ntentative way, was reckoning that they had to come to some accommodation with the ANC. Coetsee\u2019s visit was an olive branch.\nAlthough we did not discuss politics, I did bring up one sensitive issue, and that was the status of my wife. In August, shortly before I entered the\nhospital, Winnie had gone to Johannesburg to receive medical treatment. The only trips she was permitted from Brandfort were to visit either me or\nher doctor. While in Johannesburg, her house in Brandfort and the clinic behind it were firebombed and destroyed. Winnie had no place in which to\nreside, and she decided to remain in Johannesburg despite the fact that the city was off-limits to her. Nothing happened for a few weeks, and then\nthe security police wrote to inform her that the house in Brandfort had been repaired and she must return. But she refused to do so. I asked\nCoetsee to allow Winnie to remain in Johannesburg and not force her to return to Brandfort. He said he could promise nothing, but he would indeed\nlook into it. I thanked him.\n\nI spent several days in hospital recuperating from the surgery. When I was discharged, I was fetched at the hospital by Brigadier Munro.\nCommanding officers do not usually pick up prisoners at the hospital, so my suspicions were immediately aroused.\nOn the ride back, Brigadier Munro said to me in a casual way, as though he were simply making conversation, \u201cMandela, we are not taking you\nback to your friends now.\u201d I asked him what he meant. \u201cFrom now on, you are going to be alone.\u201d I asked him why. He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\nI\u2019ve just been given these instructions from headquarters.\u201d Once again, there was no warning and no explanation.\nUpon my return to Pollsmoor I was taken to a new cell on the ground floor of the prison, three floors below and in an entirely different wing. I was\ngiven three rooms, and a separate toilet, with one room to be used for sleeping, one across the hall for studying, and another for exercise. By\nprison standards, this was palatial, but the rooms were damp and musty and received very little natural light. I said nothing to the brigadier, for I\nknew the decision had not been his. I wanted time to consider the ramifications of the move. Why had the state taken this step?\nIt would be too strong to call it a revelation, but over the next few days and weeks I came to a realization about my new circumstances. The\nchange, I decided, was not a liability but an opportunity. I was not happy to be separated from my colleagues and I missed my garden and the sunny\nterrace on the third floor. But my solitude gave me a certain liberty, and I resolved to use it to do something I had been pondering for a long while:\nbegin discussions with the government. I had concluded that the time had come when the struggle could best be pushed forward through\nnegotiations. If we did not start a dialogue soon, both sides would be plunged into a dark night of oppression, violence, and war. My solitude would\ngive me an opportunity to take the first steps in that direction, without the kind of scrutiny that might destroy such efforts.\nWe had been fighting against white minority rule for three-quarters of a century. We had been engaged in the armed struggle for more than two\ndecades. Many people on both sides had already died. The enemy was strong and resolute. Yet even with all their bombers and tanks, they must\nhave sensed they were on the wrong side of history. We had right on our side, but not yet might. It was clear to me that a military victory was a\ndistant if not impossible dream. It simply did not make sense for both sides to lose thousands if not millions of lives in a conflict that was\nunnecessary. They must have known this as well. It was time to talk.\nThis would be extremely sensitive. Both sides regarded discussions as a sign of weakness and betrayal. Neither would come to the table until\nthe other made significant concessions. The government asserted over and over that we were a terrorist organization of Communists, and that they\nwould never talk to terrorists or Communists. This was National Party dogma. The ANC asserted over and over that the government was fascistic\nand racist and that there was nothing to talk about until they unbanned the ANC, unconditionally released all political prisoners, and removed the\ntroops from the townships.\nA decision to talk to the government was of such import that it should only have been made in Lusaka. But I felt that the process needed to begin,\nand that I had neither the time nor the means to communicate fully with Oliver. Someone from our side needed to take the first step, and my new\nisolation gave me both the freedom to do so and the assurance, at least for a while, of the confidentiality of my efforts.\n\nI was now in a kind of splendid isolation. Though my colleagues were only three floors above me, they might as well have been in Johannesburg. In\norder to see them, I had to put in a formal request for a visit, which had to be approved by the Head Office in Pretoria. It often took weeks to receive\na response. If it was approved, I would then meet them in the visiting area. This was a novel experience: my comrades and fellow prisoners were\nnow official visitors. For years, we had been able to talk for hours a day; now we had to make official requests and appointments, and our\nconversations were monitored.\nAfter I had been in my new cell for a few days, I asked the commanding officer to arrange such a meeting. He did so, and the four of us discussed\nthe issue of my transfer. Walter, Kathy, and Ray were angry that we had been separated. They wanted to lodge a strong protest, and demand that\nwe be reunited. My response was not what they expected. \u201cLook, chaps,\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should oppose this thing.\u201d I mentioned that my new\naccommodations were superior, and maybe this would set a precedent for all political prisoners. I then added somewhat ambiguously, \u201cPerhaps\nsomething good will come of this. I\u2019m now in a position where the government can make an approach to us.\u201d They did not care too much for this\nlatter explanation, as I knew they would not.\nI chose to tell no one of what I was about to do. Not my colleagues upstairs or those in Lusaka. The ANC is a collective, but the government had\nmade collectivity in this case impossible. I did not have the security or the time to discuss these issues with my organization. I knew that my\ncolleagues upstairs would condemn my proposal, and that would kill my initiative even before it was born. There are times when a leader must\nmove out ahead of the flock, go off in a new direction, confident that he is leading his people the right way. Finally, my isolation furnished my\norganization with an excuse in case matters went awry: the old man was alone and completely cut off, and his actions were taken by him as an\nindividual, not a representative of the ANC. WITHIN A FEW WEEKS of my move, I wrote to Kobie Coetsee to propose talks about talks. As before, I received no response. I wrote once more,\nand again there was no response. I found this peculiar and demoralizing, and I realized I had to look for another opportunity to be heard. That came\nin early .\nAt a meeting of the British Commonwealth in Nassau in October , the leaders could not reach agreement on whether to participate in\ninternational sanctions against South Africa. This was mainly because British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was adamantly opposed. To\nresolve the deadlock, the assembled nations agreed that a delegation of \u201ceminent persons\u201d would visit South Africa and report back on whether\nsanctions were the appropriate tool to help bring about the end of apartheid. In early , the seven-member Eminent Persons Group, led by\nGeneral Olusegun Obasanjo, the former military leader of Nigeria, and former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, arrived in South Africa on\ntheir fact-finding mission.\nIn February, I was visited by General Obasanjo to discuss the nature of the delegation\u2019s brief. He was eager to facilitate a meeting between me\nand the full group. With the government\u2019s permission, such a meeting was scheduled for May. The group would be talking with the cabinet after they\nsaw me, and I viewed this as a chance to raise the subject of negotiations.\nThe government regarded my session with the group as something extraordinary. Two days before the meeting I was visited by Brigadier Munro,\nwho had brought along a tailor. \u201cMandela,\u201d the commander said, \u201cwe want you to see these people on an equal footing. We don\u2019t want you to wear\nthose old prison clothes, so this tailor will take your measurements and outfit you with a proper suit.\u201d The tailor must have been some kind of wizard,\nfor the very next day I tried on a pinstriped suit that fit me like a glove. I was also given a shirt, tie, shoes, socks, and underwear. The commander\nadmired my new attire. \u201cMandela, you look like a prime minister now, not a prisoner,\u201d he said and smiled.\n* * *\nAt the meeting between myself and the Eminent Persons Group, we were joined by two significant observers: Kobie Coetsee and Lieutenant\nGeneral W. H. Willemse, the commissioner of prisons. Like the tailor, these two men were there to take my measure. But, curiously, they left shortly\nafter the session started. I pressed them to remain, saying I had nothing to hide, but they left anyway. Before they took their leave, I told them the\ntime had come for negotiations, not fighting, and that the government and the ANC should sit down and talk.\nThe Eminent Persons Group had come with many questions involving the issues of violence, negotiations, and international sanctions. At the\noutset, I set the ground rules for our discussions. \u201cI am not the head of the movement,\u201d I told them. \u201cThe head of the movement is Oliver Tambo in\nLusaka. You must go and see him. You can tell him what my views are, but they are my personal views alone. They don\u2019t even represent the views\nof my colleagues here in prison. All that being said, I favor the ANC beginning discussions with the government.\u201d\nVarious members of the group had concerns about my political ideology and what a South Africa under ANC leadership might look like. I told\nthem I was a South African nationalist, not a Communist, that nationalists came in every hue and color, and that I was firmly committed to a\nnonracial society. I told them I believed in the Freedom Charter, that the charter embodied principles of democracy and human rights, and that it\nwas not a blueprint for socialism. I spoke of my concern that the white minority feel a sense of security in any new South Africa. I told them I thought\nmany of our problems were a result of lack of communication between the government and the ANC and that some of these could be resolved\nthrough actual talks.\nThey questioned me extensively on the issue of violence, and while I was not yet willing to renounce violence, I affirmed in the strongest possible\nterms that violence could never be the ultimate solution to the situation in South Africa and that men and women by their very nature required some\nkind of negotiated understanding. While I once again reiterated that these were my views and not those of the ANC, I suggested that if the\ngovernment withdrew the army and the police from the townships, the ANC might agree to a suspension of the armed struggle as a prelude to talks.\nI told them that my release alone would not stem the violence in the country or stimulate negotiations.\nAfter the group finished with me, they planned to see both Oliver in Lusaka and government officials in Pretoria. In my remarks, I had sent\nmessages to both places. I wanted the government to see that under the right circumstances we would talk and I wanted Oliver to know that my\nposition and his were the same.\nIn May, the Eminent Persons Group was scheduled to see me one last time. I was optimistic as they had been to both Lusaka and Pretoria, and I\nhoped that the seed of negotiations had been planted. But the day before we were to meet, the South African government took a step that\nsabotaged whatever goodwill had been engendered by the Commonwealth visitors. On the day the Eminent Persons Group was scheduled to\nmeet with cabinet ministers, the South African Defense Force, under the orders of President Botha, launched air raids and commando attacks on\nANC bases in Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. This utterly poisoned the talks, and the Eminent Persons Group immediately left South Africa.\nOnce again, I felt my efforts to move negotiations forward had stalled.\n\nOliver Tambo and the ANC had called for the people of South Africa to render the country ungovernable, and the people were obliging. The state of\nunrest and political violence was reaching new heights. The anger of the masses was unrestrained; the townships were in upheaval. International\npressure was growing stronger every day. On June , , the government imposed a State of Emergency in an attempt to keep a lid on protest.\nIn every outward way, the time seemed inauspicious for negotiations. But often, the most discouraging moments are precisely the time to launch an\ninitiative. At such times people are searching for a way out of their dilemma. That month I wrote a very simple letter to General Willemse, the\ncommissioner of prisons. In it, I merely said, \u201cI wish to see you on a matter of national importance.\u201d I handed the letter to Brigadier Munro on a\nWednesday.\nThat weekend, I was told by the commanding officer to be prepared to see General Willemse, who was coming down from Pretoria. This meeting\nwas not treated in the usual fashion. Instead of conferring with the general in the visiting area, I was taken to his residence on the grounds of\nPollsmoor itself.\nWillemse is a direct fellow and we got down to business immediately. I told him I wanted to see Kobie Coetsee, the minister of justice. He asked\nme why. I hesitated for a moment, reluctant to discuss political matters with a prison official. But I responded with frankness: \u201cI want to see the\nminister in order to raise the question of talks between the government and the ANC.\u201d\nHe pondered this for a moment, and then said, \u201cMandela, as you know, I am not a politician. I cannot discuss such issues myself, for they are\nbeyond my authority.\u201d He then paused, as if something had just occurred to him. \u201cIt just so happens,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the minister of justice is in Cape\nTown. Perhaps you can see him. I will find out.\u201d\n\n\fThe general then telephoned the minister and the two spoke for a few moments. After putting down the phone, the general turned to me and said,\n\u201cThe minister said, \u2018Bring him round.\u2019 \u201d Minutes later, we left the general\u2019s residence in his car bound for the minister\u2019s house in Cape Town.\nSecurity was light; only one other car accompanied the general\u2019s vehicle. The ease and rapidity with which this meeting was set up made me\nsuspect that the government might have planned this rendezvous ahead of time. Whether they had or not was immaterial; it was an opportunity to\ntake the first step toward negotiations.\nAt his official residence in the city, Coetsee greeted me warmly and we settled down on comfortable chairs in his lounge. He apologized that I\nhad not had a chance to change out of my prison clothes. I spent three hours in conversation with him and was struck by his sophistication and\nwillingness to listen. He asked knowledgeable and relevant questions \u2014 questions that reflected a familiarity with the issues that divided the\ngovernment and the ANC. He asked me under what circumstances would we suspend the armed struggle; whether or not I spoke for the ANC as a\nwhole; whether I envisioned any constitutional guarantees for minorities in a new South Africa. His questions went to the heart of the issues dividing\nthe government and the ANC.\nAfter responding in much the same way as I did to the Eminent Persons Group, I sensed that Coetsee wanted some resolution. What is the next\nstep? he asked. I told him I wanted to see the state president and the foreign minister, Pik Botha. Coetsee noted this on a small pad he had kept\nbeside him, and said he would send my request through the proper channels. We then shook hands, and I was driven back to my solitary cell on the\nground floor of Pollsmoor Prison.\nI was greatly encouraged. I sensed the government was anxious to overcome the impasse in the country, that they were now convinced they had\nto depart from their old positions. In ghostly outline, I saw the beginnings of a compromise.\nI told no one of my encounter. I wanted the process to be under way before I informed anyone. Sometimes it is necessary to present one\u2019s\ncolleagues with a policy that is already a fait accompli. I knew that once they examined the situation carefully, my colleagues at Pollsmoor and in\nLusaka would support me. But again, after this promising start, nothing happened. Weeks and then months passed without a word from Coetsee. In\nsome frustration, I wrote him another letter. IN , I RESUMED CONTACT with Kobie Coetsee. I had several private meetings with him at his residence, and later that year the government\nmade its first concrete proposal. Coetsee said the government would like to appoint a committee of senior officials to conduct private discussions\nwith me. This would be done with the full knowledge of the state president, Coetsee said. Coetsee himself would be head of the committee, and it\nwould include General Willemse, the commissioner of prisons; Fanie van der Merwe, the director general of the Prisons Department; and Dr. Niel\nBarnard, a former academic who was then head of the National Intelligence Service. The first three individuals were associated with the prison\nsystem, so if talks foundered or were leaked to the press, both sides would be able to cover up and say we were discussing prison conditions and\nnothing more.\nThe presence of Dr. Barnard, however, disturbed me. He was the head of South Africa\u2019s equivalent of the CIA, and was also involved with\nmilitary intelligence. I could justify to my organization discussions with the other officials, but not Barnard. His presence made the talks more\nproblematic and suggested a larger agenda. I told Coetsee that I would like to think about the proposal overnight.\nThat night I considered all the ramifications. I knew that P. W. Botha had created something called the State Security Council, a shadowy\nsecretariat of security experts and intelligence officials. He had done this, according to the press, to circumvent the authority of the cabinet and\nincrease his own power. Dr. Barnard was a key player in this inner council and was said to be a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the president. I thought that my refusing\nBarnard would alienate Botha, and I decided that such a tack was too risky. If the state president was not brought on board, nothing would happen.\nIn the morning, I sent word to Coetsee that I accepted his offer.\nI knew that I had three crucial matters that I needed to address: first, I wanted to sound out my colleagues on the third floor before I proceeded any\nfurther; second, it was essential to communicate with Oliver in Lusaka about what was occurring; and finally, I intended to draft a memorandum to P.\nW. Botha laying out my views and those of the ANC on the vital issues before the country. This memorandum would create talking points for any\nfuture discussion.\nI requested a meeting with my colleagues, and to my surprise, the authorities summarily refused. This was remarkable, and I assumed it reflected\na great deal of nervousness about the prospect of secret talks between myself and the government. I took my complaints to more senior officials.\nFinally, the request was approved, with the proviso that I could see my colleagues one by one, not together.\nI met them in the visiting area. I had resolved to leave out a few details; I would seek their counsel about the idea of having talks with the\ngovernment without mentioning that an actual committee had been formed. Walter was first. I told him about my letter to the commissioner of\nprisons and my meeting with Coetsee. I said that I had discussed with Coetsee the idea of beginning talks with the government and that the\ngovernment seemed interested. What were his views on the matter?\nI have been through thick and thin with Walter. He was a man of reason and wisdom, and no man knew me better than he did. There was no one\nwhose opinion I trusted or valued more. Walter considered what I told him. I could see he was uncomfortable, and at best, lukewarm. \u201cIn principle,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cI am not against negotiations. But I would have wished that the government initiated talks with us rather than us initiating talks with them.\u201d\nI replied that if he was not against negotiations in principle, what did it matter who initiated them? What mattered was what they achieved, not\nhow they started. I told Walter that I thought we should move forward with negotiations and not worry about who knocked on the door first. Walter\nsaw that my mind was made up and he said he would not stop me, but that he hoped I knew what I was doing.\nNext was Raymond Mhlaba. I explained the entire situation to him as I had to Walter. Ray was always a man of few words, and for several\nmoments he digested what I had said. He then looked at me and said, \u201cMadiba, what have you been waiting for? We should have started this years\nago.\u201d Andrew Mlangeni\u2019s reaction was virtually the same as Ray\u2019s. The last man was Kathy. His response was negative; he was as resolutely\nagainst what I was suggesting as Raymond and Andrew were in favor. Even more strongly than Walter, he felt that by initiating talks it would appear\nthat we were capitulating. Like Walter, he said he was not in principle against negotiations, and I responded exactly as I had with Walter. But Kathy\nwas adamant; he felt I was going down the wrong path. But, despite his misgivings, he said he would not stand in my way.\n\nNot long after this I received a note from Oliver Tambo that was smuggled in to me by one of my lawyers. He had heard reports that I was having\nsecret discussions with the government and he was concerned. He said he knew I had been alone for some time and separated from my\ncolleagues. He must have been wondering: What is going on with Mandela? Oliver\u2019s note was brief and to the point: What, he wanted to know, was\nI discussing with the government? Oliver could not have believed that I was selling out, but he might have thought I was making an error in judgment.\nIn fact, the tenor of his note suggested that.\nI replied to Oliver in a very terse letter saying that I was talking to the government about one thing and one thing only: a meeting between the\nNational Executive Committee of the ANC and the South African government. I would not spell out the details, for I could not trust the confidentiality\nof the communication. I simply said the time had come for such talks and that I would not compromise the organization in any way.\nAlthough the ANC had called for talks with the government for decades, we had never been confronted with the actual prospect of such talks. It is\none thing to consider them in theory, and quite another to engage in them. As I was writing my response to Oliver, I was also beginning to draft my\nmemorandum to P. W. Botha. I would make sure that Oliver saw this as well. I knew that when Oliver and the National Executive read my memo,\ntheir fears that I had gone off the road would be allayed. THE MEETINGS had a positive effect: I was told in the winter of  that President Botha was planning to see me before the end of August. The\ncountry was still in turmoil. The government had reimposed a State of Emergency in both  and . International pressure mounted. More\ncompanies left South Africa. The American Congress had passed a sweeping sanctions bill.\nIn , the ANC celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary and held a conference at the end of the year in Tanzania attended by delegates from\nmore than fifty nations. Oliver declared that the armed struggle would intensify until the government was prepared to negotiate the abolition of\napartheid. Two years before, at the ANC\u2019s Kabwe conference in Zambia marking the thirtieth anniversary of the Freedom Charter, members of\nother races were elected to the National Executive Committee for the first time, and the NEC pledged that no discussions with the government\ncould be held until all ANC leaders were released from prison.\nAlthough violence was still pervasive, the National Party had never been stronger. In the white general election of May , the Nationalists won\nan overwhelming majority. Worse still, the liberal Progressive Federal Party had been replaced as the official opposition by the Conservative Party,\nwhich was to the right of the Nationalists and campaigned on the theme that the government was too lenient with the black opposition.\nDespite my optimism about the secret talks, it was a difficult time. I had recently had a visit from Winnie and I learned that  Orlando West,\nthe house in which we had been married and which I considered home, had been burned down by arsonists. We had lost invaluable family records,\nphotographs, and keepsakes \u2014 even the slice of wedding cake Winnie was saving for my release. I had always thought that someday when I left\nprison I would be able to recapture the past when looking over those pictures and letters, and now they were gone. Prison had robbed me of my\nfreedom but not my memories, and now I felt some enemies of the struggle had tried to rob me of even those.\nI was also suffering from a bad cough that I could not seem to shake, and I often felt too weak to exercise. I had continued to complain about the\ndampness of my cell, but nothing had been done about it. One day, during a meeting in the visiting area with my attorney, Ismail Ayob, I felt ill and\nvomited. I was taken back to my cell, examined by a doctor, and I soon recovered. A few days later, however, I was in my cell after dinner when a\nnumber of warders and a doctor arrived. The physician gave me a cursory examination, and then one of the warders told me to get dressed. \u201cWe\nare taking you to hospital in Cape Town,\u201d I was told. Security was tight; I went in a convoy of cars and military vehicles accompanied by at least a\ndozen warders.\n\nI was taken to Tygerberg Hospital, on the campus of the University of Stellenbosch, in a rich and verdant area of the Cape. As I later discovered,\nthey had nearly chosen a different facility because the authorities feared I might attract sympathetic attention at a university hospital. The warders\nwent in first and cleared everyone out of the entrance area. I was then escorted up to a floor that had been entirely emptied. The hall of the floor was\nlined with more than a dozen armed guards.\nWhile sitting on a table in the examining room, I was looked at by a young and amiable doctor who was also a professor at the university medical\nschool. He inspected my throat, tapped my chest, took some cultures, and in no time pronounced me fit. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with you,\u201d he said\nwith a smile. \u201cWe should be able to release you tomorrow.\u201d I was anxious not to be diverted from my talks with the government, so I was pleased\nwith his diagnosis.\nAfter the examination, the doctor asked me if I would like some tea. I said I would and a few minutes later, a tall young Coloured nurse came in\nwith a tray. The presence of all the armed guards and warders so frightened her that she dropped the tray on my bed, spilling the tea, before\nrushing out.\n\nI spent the night in the empty ward under heavy guard. The first thing the next morning, even before I had breakfast, I was visited by an older doctor\nwho was head of internal medicine at the hospital. He was a no-nonsense fellow and had far less of a bedside manner than the cordial young\nphysician of the night before. Without any preliminaries, he tapped me roughly on my chest and then said gruffly, \u201cThere is water in your lung.\u201d I told\nhim that the previous doctor had done tests and said I was fine. With a hint of annoyance, he said, \u201cMandela, take a look at your chest.\u201d He pointed\nout that one side of my chest was actually larger than the other, and said that it was probably filled with water.\nHe asked a nurse to bring him a syringe, and without further ado he poked it into my chest and drew out some brownish liquid. \u201cHave you had\nbreakfast?\u201d he said. No, I replied. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are taking you to the operating theater immediately.\u201d He told me I had a great deal of water\non my lung and he wanted to draw it out right away.\nIn the operating room I was given anesthesia, and the next thing I recalled was waking up in a room with the doctor present. I was groggy, but I\nconcentrated on what he said: he had removed two liters of water from my chest and when the liquid was analyzed, a tuberculosis germ had been\ndiscovered. He said it was in the very early stages of the illness, and that the germ had done no damage to the lung. While full-blown tuberculosis\nnormally took six months to cure, he said, I should be better in two months. The doctor agreed that it was probably the damp cell that had helped\ncause my illness.\n\nI spent the next six weeks at Tygerberg recuperating and receiving treatment. In December, I was moved to the Constantiaberge Clinic, a luxurious\nfacility near Pollsmoor that had never had a black patient before. My first morning there, I had an early visit from Kobie Coetsee, who was\naccompanied by Major Marais, a deputy commander responsible for looking after me. We had barely exchanged greetings when the orderly\nbrought in my breakfast.\nBecause of my recent illness and my history of high blood pressure, I had been put on a strict low-cholesterol diet. That order had apparently not\nyet been conveyed to the clinic\u2019s kitchen, for the breakfast tray contained scrambled eggs, three rashers of bacon, and several pieces of buttered\ntoast. I could not remember the last time I had tasted bacon and eggs, and I was ravenous. Just as I was about to take a delicious forkful of egg,\nMajor Marais said, \u201cNo, Mandela, that is against the orders of your physician,\u201d and he reached over to take the tray. I held it tightly, and said, \u201cMajor,\nI am sorry. If this breakfast will kill me, then today I am prepared to die.\u201d\n\nOnce I was ensconced at Constantiaberge, I again began to meet with Kobie Coetsee and the secret committee. While I was still at the clinic\nCoetsee said he wanted to put me in a situation that was halfway between confinement and freedom. While he did not spell out what this meant, I\n\n\fhad a notion of what he was talking about, and I merely nodded. I would not be so na\u00efve as to consider his proposal to be freedom, but I knew that it\nwas a step in that direction.\nIn the meantime, the clinic was extremely comfortable and for the first time I actually enjoyed a hospital convalescence. The nurses \u2014 who were\nwhite or Coloured, no black nurses were permitted \u2014 spoiled me; they brought extra desserts and pillows and were constantly visiting, even during\ntheir time off.\nOne day, one of the nurses came to me and said, \u201cMr. Mandela, we are having a party tonight and we would like you to come.\u201d I said I\u2019d be\nhonored to attend, but that the authorities would undoubtedly have something to say about it. The prison authorities refused permission for me to\ngo, which nettled the nurses, and as a result, they decided to hold their party in my room, insisting they could not have their party without me.\nThat night, a dozen or so of these young ladies in party frocks descended on my room with cake and punch and gifts. The guards seemed\nbefuddled, but they could hardly consider these vivacious young girls a security risk. In fact, when one of the guards attempted to prevent some of\nthe nurses from entering my room, I jestingly accused him of being jealous of an old man receiving so much attention from such beautiful young\nladies.",
    "1988-1994": " THE FIRST FORMAL MEETING of the secret working group took place in May , at a posh officers\u2019 club within the precincts of Pollsmoor.\nWhile I knew both Coetsee and Willemse, I had never before met van der Merwe and Dr. Barnard. Van der Merwe was a quiet, levelheaded man\nwho spoke only when he had something important to say. Dr. Barnard was in his mid-thirties and was exceedingly bright, a man of controlled\nintelligence and self-discipline.\nThe initial meeting was quite stiff, but in subsequent sessions we were able to talk more freely and directly. I met with them almost every week for\na few months, and then the meetings occurred at irregular intervals, sometimes not for a month, and then suddenly every week. The meetings were\nusually scheduled by the government, but sometimes I would request a session.\nDuring our early meetings, I discovered that my new colleagues, with the exception of Dr. Barnard, knew little about the ANC. They were all\nsophisticated Afrikaners, and far more open-minded than nearly all of their brethren. But they were the victims of so much propaganda that it was\nnecessary to straighten them out about certain facts. Even Dr. Barnard, who had made a study of the ANC, had received most of his information\nfrom police and intelligence files, which were in the main inaccurate and sullied by the prejudices of the men who had gathered them. He could not\nhelp but be infected by the same biases.\nI spent some time in the beginning sketching out the history of the ANC and then explaining our positions on the primary issues that divided the\norganization from the government. After these preliminaries, we focused on the critical issues: the armed struggle, the ANC\u2019s alliance with the\nCommunist Party, the goal of majority rule, and the idea of racial reconciliation.\nThe first issue to arise was in many ways the most crucial, and that was the armed struggle. We spent a number of months discussing it. They\ninsisted that the ANC must renounce violence and give up the armed struggle before the government would agree to negotiations \u2014 and before I\ncould meet President Botha. Their contention was that violence was nothing more than criminal behavior that could not be tolerated by the state.\nI responded that the state was responsible for the violence and that it is always the oppressor, not the oppressed, who dictates the form of the\nstruggle. If the oppressor uses violence, the oppressed have no alternative but to respond violently. In our case it was simply a legitimate form of\nself-defense. I ventured that if the state decided to use peaceful methods, the ANC would also use peaceful means. \u201cIt is up to you,\u201d I said, \u201cnot us,\nto renounce violence.\u201d\nI think I advanced their understanding on this point, but the issue soon moved from a philosophical question to a practical one. As Minister\nCoetsee and Dr. Barnard pointed out, the National Party had repeatedly stated that it would not negotiate with any organization that advocated\nviolence: therefore, how could it suddenly announce talks with the ANC without losing its credibility? In order for us to begin talks, they said, the\nANC must make some compromise so that the government would not lose face with its own people.\nIt was a fair point and one that I could well understand, but I would not offer them a way out. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d I said, \u201cit is not my job to resolve your\ndilemma for you.\u201d I simply told them that they must tell their people that there can be no peace and no solution to the situation in South Africa without\nsitting down with the ANC. People will understand, I said.\n\nThe ANC\u2019s alliance with the Communist Party seemed to trouble them almost as much as the armed struggle. The National Party accepted the\nmost hidebound of s cold war ideology and regarded the Soviet Union as the evil empire and communism as the work of the devil. There was\nnothing that one could do to disabuse them of this notion. They maintained that the Communist Party dominated and controlled the ANC and that in\norder for negotiations to begin we must break with the party.\nFirst of all, I said, no self-respecting freedom fighter would take orders from the government he is fighting against or jettison a longtime ally in the\ninterest of pleasing an antagonist. I then explained at great length that the party and the ANC were separate and distinct organizations that shared\nthe same short-term objectives, the overthrow of racial oppression and the birth of a nonracial South Africa, but that our long-term interests were not\nthe same.\nThis discussion went on for months. Like most Afrikaners, they thought that because many of the Communists in the ANC were white or Indian,\nthey were controlling the blacks in the ANC. I cited many occasions when the ANC and the CP had differed on policy and the ANC had prevailed,\nbut this did not seem to impress them. Finally, in exasperation, I said to them, \u201cYou gentlemen consider yourselves intelligent, do you not? You\nconsider yourselves forceful and persuasive, do you not? Well, there are four of you and only one of me, and you cannot control me or get me to\nchange my mind. What makes you think the Communists can succeed where you have failed?\u201d\n\nThey were also concerned about the idea of nationalization, insisting that the ANC and the Freedom Charter supported blanket nationalization for\nthe South African economy. I explained that we were for a more even distribution of the rewards of certain industries, industries that were already\nmonopolies, and that nationalization might occur in some of those areas. But I referred them to an article I wrote in  for Liberation in which I\nsaid that the Freedom Charter was not a blueprint for socialism but for African-style capitalism. I told them I had not changed my mind since then.\nThe other main area of discussion was the issue of majority rule. They felt that if there was majority role, the rights of minorities would be\ntrampled. How would the ANC protect the rights of the white minority? they wanted to know. I said that there was no organization in the history of\nSouth Africa to compare with the ANC in terms of trying to unite all the people and races of South Africa. I referred them to the preamble of the\nFreedom Charter: \u201cSouth Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white.\u201d I told them that whites were Africans as well, and that in any future\ndispensation the majority would need the minority. We do not want to drive you into the sea, I said. IN EARLY DECEMBER , security on my ward was tightened and the officers on duty were more alert than usual. Some change was imminent.\nOn the evening of December , Major Marais came into my room, and told me to prepare myself to leave. Where to? I asked him. He could not say.\nI packed my things and looked around for some of my loyal nurses; I was disappointed at not being able to thank them and bid them farewell.\nWe left in a rush, and after about an hour on the road we entered a prison whose name I recognized: Victor Verster. Located in the lovely old\nCape Dutch town of Paarl, Victor Verster is thirty-five miles northeast of Cape Town in the province\u2019s wine-growing region. The prison had the\nreputation of being a model facility. We drove through the entire length of the prison, and then along a winding dirt road through a rather wild,\nwooded area at the rear of the property. At the end of the road we came to an isolated, whitewashed one-story cottage set behind a concrete wall\nand shaded by tall fir trees.\nI was ushered into the house by Major Marais and found a spacious lounge, next to a large kitchen, with an even larger bedroom at the back of\nthe house. The place was sparsely but comfortably furnished. It had not been cleaned or swept before my arrival, and the bedroom and living room\nwere teeming with all kinds of exotic insects, centipedes, monkey spiders, and the like, some of which I had never seen before. That night, I swept\nthe insects off my bed and windowsill and slept extremely well in what was to be my new home.\nThe next morning I surveyed my new abode and discovered a swimming pool in the backyard, and two smaller bedrooms. I walked outside and\nadmired the trees that shaded the house and kept it cool. The entire place felt removed, isolated. The only thing spoiling the idyllic picture was that\nthe walls were topped with razor wire, and there were guards at the entrance to the house. Even so, it was a lovely place and situation; a halfway\nhouse between prison and freedom.\nThat afternoon I was visited by Kobie Coetsee, who brought a case of Cape wine as a housewarming gift. The irony of a jailer bringing his\nprisoner such a gift was not lost on either of us. He was extremely solicitous and wanted to make sure that I liked my new home. He surveyed the\nhouse himself, and the only thing he recommended was that the walls outside the house be raised \u2014 for my privacy, he said. He told me that the\ncottage at Victor Verster would be my last home before becoming a free man. The reason behind this move, he said, was that I should have a\nplace where I could hold discussions in privacy and comfort.\nThe cottage did in fact give one the illusion of freedom. I could go to sleep and wake up as I pleased, swim whenever I wanted, eat when I was\nhungry \u2014 all were delicious sensations. Simply to be able to go outside during the day and take a walk when I desired was a moment of private\nglory. There were no bars on the windows, no jangling keys, no doors to lock or unlock. It was altogether pleasant, but I never forgot that it was a\ngilded cage.\n\nThe prison service provided me with a cook, Warrant Officer Swart, a tall, quiet Afrikaner who had once been a warder on Robben Island. I did not\nremember him, but he said he sometimes drove us to the quarry and purposely steered the truck over bumps to give us a rocky ride. \u201cI did that to\nyou,\u201d he said sheepishly, and I laughed. He was a decent, sweet-tempered fellow without any prejudice and he became like a younger brother to\nme.\nHe arrived at seven in the morning and left at four, and would make my breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I had a diet outlined by my physician and he\nwould follow it in his preparations. He was a lovely cook, and when he went home at four, he would leave me supper to heat up in the microwave\noven, a device that was new to me.\nWarrant Officer Swart baked bread, made home-brewed ginger beer and assorted other delicacies. When I had visitors, which was increasingly\noften, he would prepare gourmet meals. They always praised the food and I daresay my chef was the envy of all my visitors. When the authorities\nbegan to permit some of my ANC comrades and members of the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Mass Democratic Movement (MDM) to\nvisit me, I accused them of coming only for the food.\nOne day, after a delicious meal prepared by Mr. Swart, I went into the kitchen to wash the dishes. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is my duty. You must return\nto the sitting room.\u201d I insisted that I had to do something, and that if he cooked, it was only fair for me to do the dishes. Mr. Swart protested, but\nfinally gave in. He also objected to the fact that I would make my bed in the morning, saying it was his responsibility to do so. But I had been making\nmy own bed for so long it had become a reflex.\nWe also traded off in another respect. Like many Afrikaans-speaking warders, he was keen to improve his English. I was always looking for\nways to improve my Afrikaans. We made an agreement: he would speak to me in English and I would answer in Afrikaans, and in that way we both\npracticed the language at which we were weakest.\nI would occasionally ask him to make certain dishes for me. I sometimes requested samp and beans, which I used to eat as a boy. One day, I\nsaid to him, \u201cYou know, I would like you to cook me some brown rice.\u201d To my astonishment, he said, \u201cWhat is brown rice?\u201d Swart was a young man,\nand I explained to him that brown rice was the unrefined rice kernel, and we used to eat it during the war when white rice was unavailable. I said it\nwas far healthier than white rice. He was skeptical, but managed to find me some. He cooked it and I enjoyed it very much. But Mr. Swart could not\nabide the taste and vowed that if I ever wanted it again, I would have to cook it myself.\n\nEven though I was not a drinker, I wanted to be a proper host and serve wine to my guests. I would occasionally take a sip of wine in order to make\nmy guests feel comfortable, but the only wine I can stomach is a South African semisweet wine, which is actually very sweet.\nBefore my guests came I would ask Mr. Swart to get a certain type of Nederburg wine, which I had tasted before and knew was a semisweet.\nOne day, I was expecting my friends and lawyers for lunch, Dullah Omar, George Bizos, and Ismail Ayob, and asked Mr. Swart to purchase some\nNederburg wine should George Bizos, not a Muslim, want some with his meal. I noticed that he grimaced when I said this, and asked him what was\nwrong.\n\u201cMr. Mandela,\u201d he said. \u201cI always buy that wine for you because you ask me to, but it is cheap stuff and not very nice.\u201d I reminded him that I did not\nlike dry wines and I was sure George could not tell the difference anyway. Mr. Swart smiled at this and proposed a compromise: he would go out\nand buy two bottles, a dry wine and my Nederburg, and then he would ask my guest which wine he preferred. \u201cFine,\u201d I said, \u201clet us try your\nexperiment.\u201d\nWhen all four of us were seated for lunch, Swart came out holding the two bottles and turned to the guests and said, \u201cGentlemen, which wine\nwould you like?\u201d Without even looking at me, George pointed to the bottle of dry white. Warrant Officer Swart just smiled.\n THE MEETINGS with the committee continued, and we stalled on the same issues that had always prevented us from moving forward: the armed\nstruggle, the Communist Party, and majority rule. I was still pressing Coetsee for a meeting with P. W. Botha. By this time, the authorities permitted\nme to have rudimentary communications with my comrades at Pollsmoor and Robben Island and also the ANC in Lusaka. Although I knew I was\ngoing out ahead of my colleagues, I did not want to go too far ahead and find that I was all alone.\nIn January , I was visited by my four comrades from Pollsmoor and we discussed the memorandum I was planning to send to the state\npresident. The memorandum reiterated most of the points I had made in our secret committee meetings, but I wanted to make sure the state\npresident heard them directly from me. He would see that we were not wild-eyed terrorists, but reasonable men.\n\u201cI am disturbed,\u201d I wrote to Mr. Botha in the memorandum, sent to him in March, \u201cas many other South Africans no doubt are, by the specter of a\nSouth Africa split into two hostile camps \u2014 blacks on one side . . . and whites on the other, slaughtering one another.\u201d To avert this and prepare the\ngroundwork for negotiations, I proposed to deal with the three demands made of the ANC by the government as a precondition to negotiations:\nrenouncing violence; breaking with the SACP; and abandoning the call for majority rule.\nOn the question of violence I wrote that the refusal of the ANC to renounce violence was not the problem: \u201cThe truth is that the government is not\nyet ready . . . for the sharing of political power with blacks.\u201d I explained our unwillingness to cast aside the SACP, and reiterated that we were not\nunder its control. \u201cWhich man of honour,\u201d I wrote, \u201cwill desert a lifelong friend at the insistence of a common opponent and still retain a measure of\ncredibility with his people?\u201d I said the rejection of majority rule by the government was a poorly disguised attempt to preserve power. I suggested he\nmust face reality. \u201cMajority rule and internal peace are like the two sides of a single coin, and white South Africa simply has to accept that there will\nnever be peace and stability in this country until the principle is fully applied.\u201d\nAt the end of the letter, I offered a very rough framework for negotiations.\nTwo political issues will have to be addressed; firstly, the demand for majority rule in a unitary state, secondly, the concern of white South Africa over this demand, as well as the\ninsistence of whites on structural guarantees that majority rule will not mean domination of the white minority by blacks. The most crucial tasks which will face the government and\nthe ANC will be to reconcile these two positions.\n\nI proposed that this be done in two stages, the first being a discussion to create the proper conditions for negotiations, the second being the\nactual negotiations themselves. \u201cI must point out that the move I have taken provides you with the opportunity to overcome the current deadlock, and\nto normalize the country\u2019s political situation. I hope you will seize it without delay.\u201d\n\nBut delay there was. In January, P. W. Botha suffered a stroke. While it did not incapacitate the president, it did weaken him and, according to his\ncabinet, made him even more irascible. In February, Botha unexpectedly resigned as head of the National Party, but kept his position as state\npresident. This was an unparalleled situation in the country\u2019s history: in the South African parliamentary system, the leader of the majority party\nbecomes the head of state. President Botha was now head of state but not of his own party. Some saw this as a positive development: that Botha\nwanted to be \u201cabove party politics\u201d in order to bring about true change in South Africa.\nPolitical violence and international pressure continued to intensify. Political detainees all across the country had held a successful hunger strike,\npersuading the minister of law and order to release over nine hundred of them. In , the UDF formed an alliance with the Congress of South\nAfrican Trade Unions (COSATU) to form the Mass Democratic Movement (MDM), which then began organizing a countrywide \u201cdefiance campaign\u201d\nof civil disobedience to challenge apartheid institutions. On the international front, Oliver held talks with the governments of Great Britain and the\nSoviet Union, and in January  met with the U.S. secretary of state, George Shultz, in Washington. The Americans recognized the ANC as an\nindispensable element of any solution in South Africa. Sanctions against South Africa remained in force and even increased.\nPolitical violence also had its tragic side. As the violence in Soweto intensified, my wife permitted a group of young men to act as her\nbodyguards as she moved around the township. These young men were untrained and undisciplined and became involved in activities that were\nunbecoming to a liberation struggle. Winnie subsequently became legally entangled in the trial of one of her bodyguards who was convicted of\nmurdering a young comrade. This situation was deeply disconcerting to me, for such a scandal only served to divide the movement at a time when\nunity was essential. I wholly supported my wife and maintained that while she had shown poor judgment, she was innocent of any serious charges.\nThat July, for my seventy-first birthday, I was visited at the cottage at Victor Verster by nearly my entire family. It was the first time I had ever had\nmy wife and children and grandchildren all in one place, and it was a grand and happy occasion. Warrant Officer Swart outdid himself in preparing\na feast, and he did not even get upset when I permitted some of the grandchildren to eat their sweets before their main course. After the meal, the\ngrandchildren went into my bedroom to watch a video of a horror movie while the adults stayed outside gossiping in the lounge. It was a deep, deep\npleasure to have my whole family around me, and the only pain was the knowledge that I had missed such occasions for so many years.\n \f\f\nON JULY , I was visited by General Willemse, who informed me that I was being taken to see President Botha the following day. He described the\nvisit as a \u201ccourtesy call,\u201d and I was told to be ready to leave at : A.M. I told the general that while I was looking forward to the meeting, I thought it\nappropriate that I have a suit and tie in which to see Mr. Botha. (The suit from the visit of the Eminent Persons Group had long since vanished.) The\ngeneral agreed, and a short while later, a tailor appeared to take my measurements. That afternoon I was delivered a new suit, tie, shirt, and shoes.\nBefore leaving, the general also asked me my blood type, just in case anything untoward should happen the following day.\nI prepared as best I could for the meeting. I reviewed my memo and the extensive notes I had made for it. I looked at as many newspapers and\npublications as I could to make sure I was up to date. After President Botha\u2019s resignation as head of the National Party, F. W. de Klerk had been\nelected in his place, and there was said to be considerable jockeying between the two men. Some might interpret Botha\u2019s willingness to meet me\nas his way of stealing thunder from his rival, but that did not concern me. I rehearsed the arguments that the state president might make and the\nones I would put in return. In every meeting with an adversary, one must make sure one has conveyed precisely the impression one intends to.\nI was tense about seeing Mr. Botha. He was known as die Groot Krokodil \u2014 the Great Crocodile \u2014 and I had heard many accounts of his\nferocious temper. He seemed to me to be the very model of the old-fashioned, stiff-necked, stubborn Afrikaner who did not so much discuss\nmatters with black leaders as dictate to them. His recent stroke had apparently only exacerbated this tendency. I resolved that if he acted in that\nfinger-wagging fashion with me I would have to inform him that I found such behavior unacceptable, and I would then stand up and adjourn the\nmeeting.\n* * *\nAt precisely : in the morning, Major Marais, the commander of Victor Verster, arrived at my cottage. He came into the lounge where I stood in\nfront of him in my new suit for inspection. He walked around me, and then shook his head from side to side.\n\u201cNo, Mandela, your tie,\u201d he said. One did not have much use for ties in prison, and I realized that morning when I was putting it on that I had\nforgotten how to tie it properly. I made a knot as best I could and hoped no one would notice. Major Marais unbuttoned my collar, loosened and then\nremoved my tie, and then, standing behind me, tied it in a double Windsor knot. He then stood back to admire his handiwork. \u201cMuch better,\u201d he\nsaid.\nWe drove from Victor Verster to Pollsmoor, to the residence of General Willemse, where we were served breakfast by the general\u2019s wife. After\nbreakfast, in a small convoy, we drove to Tuynhuys, the official presidential office, and parked in an underground garage where we would not be\nseen. Tuynhuys is a graceful, nineteenth-century Cape Dutch-style building, but I did not get a proper look at it that day. I was essentially smuggled\ninto the presidential suite.\nWe took an elevator to the ground floor and emerged in a grand, wood-paneled lobby in front of the president\u2019s office. There we were met by\nKobie Coetsee and Niel Barnard, and a retinue of prison officials. I had spoken extensively with both Coetsee and Dr. Barnard about this meeting,\nand they had always advised me to avoid controversial issues with the president. While we were waiting, Dr. Barnard looked down and noticed that\nmy shoelaces were not properly tied and he quickly kneeled down to tie them for me. I realized just how nervous they were, and that did not make\nme any calmer. The door then opened and I walked in expecting the worst.\nFrom the opposite side of his grand office, P. W. Botha walked toward me. He had planned his march perfectly, for we met exactly halfway. He\nhad his hand out and was smiling broadly, and in fact, from that very first moment, he completely disarmed me. He was unfailingly courteous,\ndeferential, and friendly.\nWe very quickly posed for a photograph of the two of us shaking hands, and then were joined at a long table by Kobie Coetsee, General\nWillemse, and Dr. Barnard. Tea was served and we began to talk. From the first, it was not as though we were engaged in tense political\narguments but a lively and interesting tutorial. We did not discuss substantive issues, so much as history and South African culture. I mentioned that\nI had recently read an article in an Afrikaans magazine about the  Afrikaner Rebellion, and I mentioned how they had occupied towns in the\nFree State. I said I saw our struggle as parallel to this famous rebellion, and we discussed this historical episode for quite a while. South African\nhistory, of course, looks very different to the black man than to the white man. Their view was that the rebellion had been a quarrel between\nbrothers, whereas my struggle was a revolutionary one. I said that it could also be seen as a struggle between brothers who happen to be different\ncolors.\nThe meeting was not even half an hour, and was friendly and breezy until the end. It was then that I raised a serious issue. I asked Mr. Botha to\nrelease unconditionally all political prisoners, including myself. That was the only tense moment in the meeting, and Mr. Botha said that he was\nafraid that he could not do that.\nThere was then a brief discussion as to what we should say if news of the meeting leaked out. We very quickly drafted a bland statement saying\nthat we had met for tea in an effort to promote peace in the country. When this was agreed upon, Mr. Botha rose and shook my hand, saying what a\npleasure it had been. Indeed, it had been. I thanked him, and left the way we had come.\nWhile the meeting was not a breakthrough in terms of negotiations, it was one in another sense. Mr. Botha had long talked about the need to\ncross the Rubicon, but he never did it himself until that morning at Tuynhuys. Now, I felt, there was no turning back.\n\nA little more than a month later, in August , P. W. Botha went on national television to announce his resignation as state president. In a\ncuriously rambling farewell address, he accused cabinet members of a breach of trust, of ignoring him and of playing into the hands of the African\nNational Congress. The following day, F. W. de Klerk was sworn in as acting president and affirmed his commitment to change and reform.\nTo us, Mr. de Klerk was a cipher. When he became head of the National Party, he seemed to be the quintessential party man, nothing more and\nnothing less. Nothing in his past seemed to hint at a spirit of reform. As education minister, he had attempted to keep black students out of white\nuniversities. But as soon as he took over the National Party, I began to follow him closely. I read all of his speeches, listened to what he said, and\nbegan to see that he represented a genuine departure from his predecessor. He was not an ideologue, but a pragmatist, a man who saw change\nas necessary and inevitable. On the day he was sworn in, I wrote him a letter requesting a meeting.\nIn his inaugural address, Mr. de Klerk said his government was committed to peace and that it would negotiate with any other group committed to\npeace. But his commitment to a new order was demonstrated only after his inauguration when a march was planned in Cape Town to protest police\nbrutality. It was to be led by Archbishop Tutu and the Reverend Allan Boesak. Under President Botha, the march would have been banned,\nmarchers would have defied that ban, and violence would have resulted. The new president lived up to his promise to ease restrictions on political\n\n\fgatherings and permitted the march to take place, only asking that the demonstrators remain peaceful. A new and different hand was on the tiller. EVEN AS DE KLERK became president, I continued to meet with the secret negotiating committee. We were joined by Gerrit Viljoen, the minister\nof constitutional development, a brilliant man with a doctorate in classics, whose role was to bring our discussions into a constitutional framework. I\npressed the government to display evidence of its good intentions, urging the state to show its bona fides by releasing my fellow political prisoners\nat Pollsmoor and Robben Island. While I told the committee that my colleagues had to be released unconditionally, I said the government could\nexpect disciplined behavior from them after their release. That was demonstrated by the conduct of Govan Mbeki, who had been unconditionally\nreleased at the end of .\nOn October , , President de Klerk announced that Walter Sisulu and seven of my former Robben Island comrades, Raymond Mhlaba,\nAhmed Kathrada, Andrew Mlangeni, Elias Motsoaledi, Jeff Masemola, Wilton Mkwayi, and Oscar Mpetha, were to be released. That morning, I had\nbeen visited by Walter, Kathy, Ray, and Andrew, who were still at Pollsmoor, and I was able to say good-bye. It was an emotional moment, but I\nknew I would not be too far behind. The men were released five days later from Johannesburg Prison. It was an action that rightly evoked praise\nhere and abroad, and I conveyed my appreciation to Mr. de Klerk.\nBut my gratitude paled compared to my unalloyed joy that Walter and the others were free. It was a day we had yearned for and fought for over so\nmany years. De Klerk had lived up to his promise, and the men were released under no bans; they could speak in the name of the ANC. It was clear\nthat the ban on the organization had effectively expired, a vindication of our long struggle and our resolute adherence to principle.\nDe Klerk began a systematic dismantling of many of the building blocks of apartheid. He opened South African beaches to people of all colors,\nand stated that the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act would soon be repealed. Since  this act had enforced what was known as \u201cpetty\napartheid,\u201d segregating parks, theaters, restaurants, buses, libraries, toilets, and other public facilities, according to race. In November, he\nannounced that the National Security Management System, a secret structure set up under P. W. Botha to combat anti-apartheid forces, would be\ndissolved.\nIn early December, I was informed that a meeting with de Klerk was set for the twelfth of that month. By this time I was able to consult with my\ncolleagues new and old, and I had meetings at the cottage with my old colleagues, and the leaders of the Mass Democratic Movement and the\nUDF. I received ANC people from all of the regions, as well as delegates from the UDF and COSATU. One of these young men was Cyril\nRamaphosa, the general secretary of the National Union of Mine Workers and one of the ablest of the new generation of leadership. I also had\nvisits from colleagues of mine from Robben Island, including Terror Lekota and Tokyo Sexwale, who stayed to lunch. They are both men with large\nappetites, and the only complaint I heard about them was from Warrant Officer Swart, who said, \"Those fellows will eat us out of house and home!\u201d\nWith guidance from a number of colleagues, I then drafted a letter to de Klerk not unlike the one I had sent to P. W. Botha. The subject was talks\nbetween the government and the ANC. I told the president that the current conflict was draining South Africa\u2019s lifeblood and talks were the only\nsolution. I said the ANC would accept no preconditions to talks, especially not the precondition that the government wanted: the suspension of the\narmed struggle. The government asked for an \u201chonest commitment to peace\u201d and I pointed out that our readiness to negotiate was exactly that.\nI told Mr. de Klerk how impressed I was by his emphasis on reconciliation, enunciated in his inaugural address. His words had imbued millions of\nSouth Africans and people around the world with the hope that a new South Africa was about to be born. The very first step on the road to\nreconciliation, I said, was the complete dismantling of apartheid and all the measures used to enforce it.\nBut I said that the spirit of that speech had not been much in evidence of late. The government\u2019s policies were perceived by many as a\ncontinuation of apartheid by other means. The government, I said, had spent too much time talking with black homeland leaders and others coopted\nby the system; these men, I asserted, were the agents of an oppressive past that the mass of black South Africans rejected.\nI reiterated my proposal that talks take place in two stages. I told him I fully supported the guidelines the ANC had adopted in the Harare\nDeclaration of , which put the onus on the government to eliminate the obstacles to negotiations that the state itself had created. Those\ndemands included the release of all political prisoners, the lifting of all bans on restricted organizations and persons, the end to the State of\nEmergency, and the removal of all troops from the townships. I stressed that a mutually agreed-upon cease-fire to end hostilities ought to be the first\norder of business, for without that, no business could be conducted. The day before our meeting the letter was delivered to Mr. de Klerk.\n\nOn the morning of December , I was again taken to Tuynhuys. I met de Klerk in the same room where I had had tea with his predecessor. Mr. de\nKlerk was accompanied by Kobie Coetsee, General Willemse, Dr. Barnard, and his colleague Mike Louw. I congratulated Mr. de Klerk on\nbecoming president and expressed the hope that we would be able to work together. He was extremely cordial and reciprocated these sentiments.\nFrom the first I noticed that Mr. de Klerk listened to what I had to say. This was a novel experience. National Party leaders generally heard what\nthey wanted to hear in discussions with black leaders, but Mr. de Klerk seemed to be making an attempt to truly understand.\nOne of the issues I emphasized that day was the National Party\u2019s recently introduced five-year plan, which contained the concept of \u201cgroup\nrights.\u201d The idea of \u201cgroup rights\u201d was that no racial or ethnic group could take precedence over any other. Although they defined \u201cgroup rights\u201d as a\nway of protecting the freedom of minorities in a new South Africa, in fact their proposal was a means of preserving white domination. I told Mr. de\nKlerk that this was unacceptable to the ANC.\nI added that it was not in his interest to retain this concept, for it gave the impression that he wanted to modernize apartheid without abandoning\nit; this was damaging his image and that of the National Party in the eyes of the progressive forces in this country and around the world. An\noppressive system cannot be reformed, I said, it must be entirely cast aside. I mentioned an editorial that I had recently read in Die Burger, the\nmouthpiece of the National Party in the Cape, implying that the group rights concept was conceived as an attempt to bring back apartheid through\nthe back door. I told Mr. de Klerk that if that was how his party\u2019s paper perceived group rights, how did he think we regarded it? I added that the\nANC had not struggled against apartheid for seventy-five years only to yield to a disguised form of it and that if it was his true intention to preserve\napartheid through the Trojan horse of group rights, then he did not truly believe in ending apartheid.\nMr. de Klerk, I saw that day, does not react quickly to things. It was a mark of the man that he listened to what I had to say and did not argue with\nme. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cmy aim is no different than yours. Your memo to P. W. Botha said the ANC and the government should work together to\ndeal with white fears of black domination, and the idea of \u2018group rights\u2019 is how we propose to deal with it.\u201d I was impressed with this response, but\nsaid that the idea of \u201cgroup rights\u201d did more to increase black fears than allay white ones. De Klerk then said, \u201cWe will have to change it, then.\u201d\nI then brought up the question of my freedom and said that if he expected me to go out to pasture upon my release he was greatly mistaken. I\nreaffirmed that if I was released into the same conditions under which I had been arrested I would go back to doing precisely those things for which I\nhad been imprisoned. I made the case to him that the best way to move forward was to unban the ANC and all other political organizations, to lift\nthe State of Emergency, to release political prisoners, and to allow the exiles to return. If the government did not unban the ANC, as soon as I was\n\n\fout of prison I would be working for an illegal organization. \u201cThen,\u201d I said, \u201cyou must simply rearrest me after I walk through those gates.\u201d\nAgain, he listened carefully to what I had to say. My suggestions certainly came as no surprise to him. He said he would take all that I said under\nconsideration, but that he would make no promises. The meeting was an exploratory one and I understood that nothing was going to be resolved\nthat day. But it was extremely useful, for I had taken the measure of Mr. de Klerk just as I did with new prison commanders when I was on Robben\nIsland. I was able to write to our people in Lusaka that Mr. de Klerk seemed to represent a true departure from the National Party politicians of the\npast. Mr. de Klerk, I said, echoing Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s famous description of Mr. Gorbachev, was a man we could do business with.\n I AWOKE ON THE DAY of my release after only a few hours\u2019 sleep at : A.M. February  was a cloudless, end-of-summer Cape Town day. I did\na shortened version of my usual exercise regimen, washed, and ate breakfast. I then telephoned a number of people from the ANC and the UDF in\nCape Town to come to the cottage to prepare for my release and work on my speech. The prison doctor came by to give me a brief checkup. I did\nnot dwell on the prospect of my release, but on all the many things I had to do before then. As so often happens in life, the momentousness of an\noccasion is lost in the welter of a thousand details.\nThere were numerous matters that had to be discussed and resolved with very little time to do so. A number of comrades from the reception\ncommittee, including Cyril Ramaphosa and Trevor Manuel, were at the house bright and early. I wanted initially to address the people of Paarl, who\nhad been very kind to me during my incarceration, but the reception committee was adamant that that would not be a good idea: it would look\ncurious if I gave my first speech to the prosperous white burghers of Paarl. Instead, as planned, I would speak first to the people of Cape Town at\nthe Grand Parade in Cape Town.\nOne of the first questions to be resolved was where I would spend my first night of freedom. My inclination was to spend the night in the Cape\nFlats, the bustling black and Coloured townships of Cape Town, in order to show my solidarity with the people. But my colleagues and, later, my\nwife argued that for security reasons I should stay with Archbishop Desmond Tutu in Bishop\u2019s Court, a plush residence in a white suburb. It was not\nan area where I would have been permitted to live before I went to prison, and I thought it would send the wrong signal to spend my first night of\nfreedom in a posh white area. But the members of the committee explained that Bishop\u2019s Court had become multiracial under Tutu\u2019s tenure, and\nsymbolized an open, generous nonracialism.\nThe prison service supplied me with boxes and crates for packing. During my first twenty or so years in prison, I accumulated very few\npossessions, but in the last few years I had amassed enough property \u2014 mainly books and papers \u2014 to make up for previous decades. I filled over\na dozen crates and boxes.\n\nMy actual release time was set for  P.M., but Winnie and Walter and the other passengers from the chartered flight from Johannesburg did not\narrive until after two. There were already dozens of people at the house, and the entire scene took on the aspect of a celebration. Warrant Officer\nSwart prepared a final meal for all of us, and I thanked him not only for the food he had provided for the last two years but the companionship.\nWarrant Officer James Gregory was also there at the house, and I embraced him warmly. In the years that he had looked after me from Pollsmoor\nthrough Victor Verster, we had never discussed politics, but our bond was an unspoken one and I would miss his soothing presence. Men like\nSwart, Gregory, and Warrant Officer Brand reinforced my belief in the essential humanity even of those who had kept me behind bars for the\nprevious twenty-seven and a half years.\nThere was little time for lengthy farewells. The plan was that Winnie and I would be driven in a car to the front gate of the prison. I had told the\nauthorities that I wanted to be able to say good-bye to the guards and warders who had looked after me and I asked that they and their families wait\nfor me at the front gate, where I would be able to thank them individually.\nAt a few minutes after three, I was telephoned by a well-known SABC presenter who requested that I get out of the car a few hundred feet before\nthe gate so that they could film me walking toward freedom. This seemed reasonable, and I agreed to do it. This was my first inkling that things\nmight not go as calmly as I had imagined.\nBy :, I began to get restless, as we were already behind schedule. I told the members of the reception committee that my people had been\nwaiting for me for twenty-seven years and I did not want to keep them waiting any longer. Shortly before four, we left in a small motorcade from the\ncottage. About a quarter of a mile in front of the gate, the car slowed to a stop and Winnie and I got out and began to walk toward the prison gate.\nAt first, I could not really make out what was going on in front of us, but when I was within one hundred fifty feet or so, I saw a tremendous\ncommotion and a great crowd of people: hundreds of photographers and television cameras and newspeople as well as several thousand wellwishers. I was astounded and a little bit alarmed. I had truly not expected such a scene; at most, I had imagined that there would be several dozen\npeople, mainly the warders and their families. But this proved to be only the beginning; I realized we had not thoroughly prepared for all that was\nabout to happen.\nWithin twenty feet or so of the gate, the cameras started clicking, a noise that sounded like some great herd of metallic beasts. Reporters started\nshouting questions; television crews began crowding in; ANC supporters were yelling and cheering. It was a happy, if slightly disorienting chaos.\nWhen a television crew thrust a long, dark, furry object at me, I recoiled slightly, wondering if it were some newfangled weapon developed while I\nwas in prison. Winnie informed me that it was a microphone.\nWhen I was among the crowd I raised my right fist and there was a roar. I had not been able to do that for twenty-seven years and it gave me a\nsurge of strength and joy. We stayed among the crowd for only a few minutes before jumping back into the car for the drive to Cape Town. Although\nI was pleased to have such a reception, I was greatly vexed by the fact that I did not have a chance to say good-bye to the prison staff. As I finally\nwalked through those gates to enter a car on the other side, I felt \u2014 even at the age of seventy-one \u2014 that my life was beginning anew. My ten\nthousand days of imprisonment were over.\n\nCape Town was thirty-five miles to the southwest, but because of the unexpected crowds at the gate, the driver elected to take a different path to\nthe city. We drove round to the back of the prison, and our convoy took small roads and byways into town. We drove through beautiful green\nvineyards and manicured farms, and I relished the scenery around me.\nThe countryside was lush and well cared for, but what surprised me was how many white families were standing beside the road to get a glimpse\nof our motorcade. They had heard on the radio that we were taking an alternate route. Some, perhaps a dozen, even raised their clenched right\nfists in what had become the ANC power salute. This astonished me; I was tremendously encouraged by these few brave souls from a conservative\nfarming area who expressed their solidarity. At one point, I stopped and got out of the car to greet and thank one such white family and tell them\nhow inspired I was by their support. It made me think that the South Africa I was returning to was far different from the one I had left.\nAs we entered the outskirts of the city, I could see people streaming toward the center. The reception committee had organized a rally at the\nGrand Parade in Cape Town, a great open square that stretched out in front of the old City Hall. I would speak to the crowd from the balcony of that\nbuilding, which overlooked the entire area. We heard sketchy reports that a great sea of people had been waiting there since morning. The plan\nwas for our motorcade to avoid the crowd and drive around to the back of City Hall, where I would quietly enter the building.\nThe drive to Cape Town took forty-five minutes, and as we neared the Grand Parade we could see an enormous crowd. The driver was meant to\n\n\fturn right and skirt its edges, but instead, he inexplicably plunged straight into the sea of people. Immediately the crowd surged forward and\nenveloped the car. We inched forward for a minute or two but were then forced to stop by the sheer press of bodies. People began knocking on the\nwindows, and then on the boot and the bonnet. Inside it sounded like a massive hailstorm. Then people began to jump on the car in their\nexcitement. Others began to shake it and at that moment I began to worry. I felt as though the crowd might very well kill us with their love.\nThe driver was even more anxious than Winnie and I, and he was clamoring to jump out of the car. I told him to stay calm and remain inside, that\nothers from the cars behind us would come to our rescue. Allan Boesak and others began to attempt to clear a way for our vehicle and push the\npeople off the car, but with little success. We sat inside \u2014 it would have been futile to even attempt to open the door, so many people were\npressing on it \u2014 for more than an hour, imprisoned by thousands of our own supporters. The scheduled beginning of the speech had long passed.\nSeveral dozen marshals eventually came to the rescue and managed slowly to clear an exit path. When we finally broke free, the driver set off at\ngreat speed in the opposite direction from City Hall. \u201cMan, where are you going?\u201d I asked him in some agitation. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d he said, his voice\ntense with anxiety. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything like that before,\u201d he said, and then continued driving without any destination in mind.\nWhen he began to calm down I gave him directions to the house of my friend and attorney Dullah Omar, who lived in the Indian area of the city.\nWe could go there, I said, and relax for a few minutes. This appealed to him. Fortunately, Dullah and his family were home, but they were more than\na bit surprised to see us. I was a free man for the first time in twenty-seven years, but instead of greeting me, they said with some concern, \u201cAren\u2019t\nyou meant to be at the Grand Parade?\u201d\nWe were able to sip some cold drinks at Dullah\u2019s, but we had only been there a few minutes when Archbishop Tutu telephoned. How he knew we\nwere there I do not know. He was quite distressed and said, \u201cNelson, you must come back to the Grand Parade immediately. The people are\ngrowing restless. If you do not return straightaway I cannot vouch for what will happen. I think there might be an uprising!\u201d I said I would return at\nonce.\nOur problem was the driver: he was deeply reluctant to return to the Grand Parade. But I remonstrated with him and soon we were on our way\nback to City Hall. The building was surrounded by people on all sides, but it was not as dense in the back, and the driver managed to make his way\nthrough to the rear entrance. It was almost dusk when I was led up to the top floor of this stately building whose halls had always been filled with\nshuffling white functionaries. I walked out onto the balcony and saw a boundless sea of people cheering, holding flags and banners, clapping, and\nlaughing.\nI raised my fist to the crowd and the crowd responded with an enormous cheer. Those cheers fired me anew with the spirit of the struggle.\n\u201cAmandla!\u201d I called out. \u201cNgawethu!\u201d they responded. \u201ciAfrika!\u201d I yelled; \u201cMayibuye!\u201d they answered. Finally, when the crowd had settled down a bit, I\ntook out my speech and then reached into my breast pocket for my glasses. They were not there; I had left them at Victor Verster. I knew Winnie\u2019s\nglasses were a similar prescription and I borrowed hers.\nFriends, comrades and fellow South Africans. I greet you all in the name of peace, democracy and freedom for all! I stand here before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant\nof you, the people. Your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today. I therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands.\n\nI spoke from the heart. I wanted first of all to tell the people that I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had became a leader because of\nextraordinary circumstances. I wanted immediately to thank the people all over the world who had campaigned for my release. I thanked the people\nof Cape Town, and I saluted Oliver Tambo and the African National Congress, Umkhonto we Sizwe, the South African Communist Party, the UDF,\nthe South African Youth Congress, COSATU, the Mass Democratic Movement, the National Union of South African Students, and the Black Sash,\na group formed by women that had long been a voice of conscience. I also publicly expressed my gratitude to my wife and family, saying, \u201cI am\nconvinced that [their] pain and suffering was far greater than my own.\u201d\nI told the crowd in no uncertain terms that apartheid had no future in South Africa, and that the people must not let up their campaign of mass\naction. \u201cThe sight of freedom looming on the horizon should encourage us to redouble our efforts.\u201d I felt it was important publicly to explain my talks\nwith the government. \u201cToday,\u201d I said, \u201cI wish to report to you that my talks with the government have been aimed at normalizing the political situation\nin the country. I wish to stress that I myself have at no time entered into negotiations about the future of our country except to insist on a meeting\nbetween the ANC and the government.\u201d\nI said I hoped that a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement could soon be achieved, ending the need for the armed struggle. The steps to\nachieving such a climate, I said, had been outlined in the ANC\u2019s  Harare Declaration. As a condition to real negotiations, I said, the\ngovernment must immediately end the State of Emergency and free all political prisoners.\nI told the people that de Klerk had gone further than any other Nationalist leader to normalize the situation and then, in words that came back to\nhaunt me, I called Mr. de Klerk \u201ca man of integrity.\u201d These words were flung back at me many times when Mr. de Klerk seemed not to live up to\nthem.\nIt was vital for me to show my people and the government that I was unbroken and unbowed, and that the struggle was not over for me but\nbeginning anew in a different form. I affirmed that I was \u201ca loyal and disciplined member of the African National Congress.\u201d I encouraged the people\nto return to the barricades, to intensify the struggle, and we would walk the last mile together.\n\nIt was evening by the time my speech was finished, and we were hustled back into our cars for the trip to Bishop\u2019s Court. As we entered its pristine\nenvirons, I saw hundreds of black faces waiting to greet me. When they saw us, the people burst into song. When I greeted Archbishop Tutu, I\nenveloped him in a great hug; here was a man who had inspired an entire nation with his words and his courage, who had revived the people\u2019s\nhope during the darkest of times. We were led inside the house where more family and friends met us, but for me, the most wonderful moment was\nwhen I was told that I had a telephone call from Stockholm. I knew immediately who it was. Oliver\u2019s voice was weak, but unmistakable, and to hear\nhim after all those years filled me with great joy. Oliver was in Sweden recuperating from a debilitating stroke he had suffered in August . We\nagreed that we would meet as soon as possible.\nMy dream upon leaving prison was to take a leisurely drive down to the Transkei, and visit my birthplace, the hills and streams where I had played\nas a boy, and the burial ground of my mother, which I had never seen. But my dream had to be deferred, for I learned very quickly of the extensive\nplans that the ANC had for me, and none of them involved a relaxing journey to the Transkei. I WAS SCHEDULED to hold a press conference the afternoon after my release, and in the morning I met with a number of my colleagues to talk\nabout scheduling and strategy. A small mountain of telegrams and messages of congratulations had arrived, and I tried to review as many of these\nas possible. There were telegrams from all around the world, from presidents and prime ministers, but I remember one in particular from a white\nCape Town housewife that amused me greatly. It read: \u201cI am very glad that you are free, and that you are back among your friends and family, but\nyour speech yesterday was very boring.\u201d\nBefore I went to prison I never held such a press conference as I did that day. In the old days there were no television cameras, and most ANC\npress conferences were conducted clandestinely. That afternoon, there were so many journalists, from so many different countries, I did not know\nwhom to speak with. I was pleased to see a high percentage of black journalists among the throng. At the press conference I was once again keen\nto reassert a number of themes: first, that I was a loyal and disciplined member of the ANC. I was mindful of the fact that the most senior ANC\npeople would be watching my release from abroad, and attempting to gauge my fidelity from a distance. I was aware that they had heard rumors\nthat I had strayed from the organization, that I was compromised, so at every turn I sought to reassure them. When asked what role I would play in\nthe organization, I told the press that I would play whatever role the ANC ordered.\nI told the reporters that there was no contradiction between my continuing support for the armed struggle and my advocating negotiations. It was\nthe reality and the threat of the armed struggle that had brought the government to the verge of negotiations. I added that when the state stopped\ninflicting violence on the ANC, the ANC would reciprocate with peace. Asked about sanctions, I said the ANC could not yet call for the relaxation of\nsanctions, because the situation that caused sanctions in the first place \u2014 the absence of political rights for blacks \u2014 was still the status quo. I\nmight be out of jail, I said, but I was not yet free.\nI was asked as well about the fears of whites. I knew that people expected me to harbor anger toward whites. But I had none. In prison, my anger\ntoward whites decreased, but my hatred for the system grew. I wanted South Africa to see that I loved even my enemies while I hated the system\nthat turned us against one another.\nI wanted to impress upon the reporters the critical role of whites in any new dispensation. I have tried never to lose sight of this. We did not want\nto destroy the country before we freed it, and to drive the whites away would devastate the nation. I said that there was a middle ground between\nwhite fears and black hopes, and we in the ANC would find it. \u201cWhites are fellow South Africans,\u201d I said, \u201cand we want them to feel safe and to know\nthat we appreciate the contribution that they have made toward the development of this country.\u201d Any man or woman who abandons apartheid will\nbe embraced in our struggle for a democratic, nonracial South Africa; we must do everything we can to persuade our white compatriots that a new,\nnonracial South Africa will be a better place for all.\nFrom my very first press conference I noticed that journalists were as eager to learn about my personal feelings and relationships as my political\nthoughts. This was new to me; when I went to prison, a journalist would never have thought of asking questions about one\u2019s wife and family, one\u2019s\nemotions, one\u2019s most intimate moments. While it was understandable that the press might be interested in these things, I nevertheless found their\ncuriosity difficult to satisfy. I am not and never have been a man who finds it easy to talk about his feelings in public. I was often asked by reporters\nhow it felt to be free, and I did my best to describe the indescribable, and usually failed.\nAfter the press conference, Archbishop Tutu\u2019s wife telephoned us from Johannesburg to say that we must fly there straightaway. Winnie and I had\nhoped to spend a few days in Cape Town relaxing, but the message we were getting was that the people of Johannesburg were getting restless\nand there might be chaos if I did not return directly. We flew to Johannesburg that evening, but I was informed that there were thousands of people\nsurrounding our old home,  Orlando West, which had been reconstructed, and that it would be unwise to go there. I reluctantly acceded; I\nyearned to spend my second night of freedom under my own roof. Instead, Winnie and I stayed in the northern suburbs at the home of an ANC\nsupporter.\nThe following morning we flew by helicopter to the First National Bank Stadium in Soweto. We were able to make an aerial tour of Soweto, the\nteeming metropolis of matchbox houses, tin shanties, and dirt roads, the mother city of black urban South Africa, the only home I ever knew as a\nman before I went to prison. While Soweto had grown, and in some places prospered, the overwhelming majority of the people remained dreadfully\npoor, without electricity or running water, eking out an existence that was shameful in a nation as wealthy as South Africa. In many places, the\npoverty was far worse than when I went to prison.\n* * *\nWe circled over the stadium, overflowing with , people, and landed in the center. The stadium was so crowded, with people sitting or\nstanding in every inch of space, that it looked as though it would burst. I expressed my delight to be back among them, but I then scolded the people\nfor some of the crippling problems of urban black life. Students, I said, must return to school. Crime must be brought under control. I told them that I\nhad heard of criminals masquerading as freedom fighters, harassing innocent people and setting alight vehicles; these rogues had no place in the\nstruggle. Freedom without civility, freedom without the ability to live in peace, was not true freedom at all.\nToday, my return to Soweto fills my heart with joy. At the same time I also return with a deep sense of sadness. Sadness to learn that you are still suffering under an inhuman\nsystem. The housing shortage, the schools crisis, unemployment and the crime rate still remain. . . . As proud as I am to be part of the Soweto community, I have been greatly\ndisturbed by the statistics of crime that I read in the newspapers. Although I understand the deprivations our people suffer I must make it clear that the level of crime in the township\nis unhealthy and must be eliminated as a matter of urgency.\n\nI ended by opening my arms to all South Africans of goodwill and good intentions, saying that \u201cno man or woman who has abandoned apartheid\nwill be excluded from our movement toward a nonracial, united and democratic South Africa based on one-person one-vote on a common voters\u2019\nroll.\u201d That was the ANC\u2019s mission, the goal that I had always kept before me during the many lonely years in prison, the goal that I would work\ntoward during the remaining years of my life. It was the dream I cherished when I entered prison at the age of forty-four, but I was no longer a young\nman, I was seventy-one, and I could not afford to waste any time.\n\nThat night, I returned with Winnie to number  in Orlando West. It was only then that I knew in my heart that I had left prison. For me,  was\nthe centerpoint of my world, the place marked with an X in my mental geography. The house had been soundly rebuilt after the fire. When I saw the\nfour-roomed house, I was surprised by how much smaller and humbler it was than I remembered it being. Compared to my cottage at Victor\nVerster, number  could have been the servants\u2019 quarters at the back. But any house in which a man is free is a castle when compared to even\n\n\fthe plushest prison.\nThat night, as happy as I was to be home, I had a sense that what I most wanted and longed for was going to be denied me. I yearned to resume\na normal and ordinary life, to pick up some of the old threads from my life as a young man, to be able to go to my office in the morning and return to\nmy family in the evening, to be able to pop out and buy some toothpaste at the pharmacy, to visit in the evening with old friends. These ordinary\nthings are what one misses most in prison, and dreams about doing when one is free. But I quickly realized that such things were not going to be\npossible. That night, and every night for the next weeks and months, the house was surrounded by hundreds of well-wishers. People sang and\ndanced and called out, and their joy was infectious. These were my people, and I had no right and no desire to deny myself to them. But in giving\nmyself to my people I could see that I was once again taking myself away from my family.\nWe did not sleep much that night, as the singing continued until the early hours, when members of the ANC and UDF who were guarding the\nhouse begged the crowd to remain quiet and allow us to rest. There were many in the ANC who advised me to move to the home a few blocks\ndistant, in Diepkloof extension, that Winnie had built while I was in prison. It was a grand place by Soweto standards, but it was a house that held no\nmeaning or memories for me. Moreover, it was a house that because of its size and expense seemed somehow inappropriate for a leader of the\npeople. I rejected that advice for as long as I could. I wanted not only to live among my people, but like them. ON FEBRUARY , , F. W. de Klerk stood before Parliament to make the traditional opening speech and did something no other South African\nhead of state had ever done: he truly began to dismantle the apartheid system and lay the groundwork for a democratic South Africa. In dramatic\nfashion, Mr. de Klerk announced the lifting of the bans on the ANC, the PAC, the South African Communist Party, and thirty-one other illegal\norganizations; the freeing of political prisoners incarcerated for nonviolent activities; the suspension of capital punishment; and the lifting of various\nrestrictions imposed by the State of Emergency. \u201cThe time for negotiation has arrived,\u201d he said.\nIt was a breathtaking moment, for in one sweeping action he had virtually normalized the situation in South Africa. Our world had changed\novernight. After forty years of persecution and banishment, the ANC was now a legal organization. I and all my comrades could no longer be\narrested for being a member of the ANC, for carrying its green, yellow, and black banner, for speaking its name. For the first time in almost thirty\nyears, my picture and my words, and those of all my banned comrades, could freely appear in South African newspapers. The international\ncommunity applauded de Klerk\u2019s bold actions. Amidst all the good news, however, the ANC objected to the fact that Mr. de Klerk had not\ncompletely lifted the State of Emergency or ordered the troops out of the townships.\nOn February , seven days after Mr. de Klerk\u2019s speech opening Parliament, I was informed that I was again going to Tuynhuys. I arrived at six\no\u2019clock in the evening. I met a smiling Mr. de Klerk in his office and as we shook hands, he informed me that he was going to release me from\nprison the following day. Although the press in South Africa and around the world had been speculating for weeks that my release was imminent,\nMr. de Klerk\u2019s announcement nevertheless came as a surprise to me. I had not been told that the reason Mr. de Klerk wanted to see me was to tell\nme that he was making me a free man.\nI felt a conflict between my blood and my brain. I deeply wanted to leave prison as soon as I could, but to do so on such short notice would not be\nwise. I thanked Mr. de Klerk, and then said that at the risk of appearing ungrateful I would prefer to have a week\u2019s notice in order that my family and\nmy organization could be prepared for my release. Simply to walk out tomorrow, I said, would cause chaos. I asked Mr. de Klerk to release me a\nweek from that day. After waiting twenty-seven years, I could certainly wait another seven days.\nDe Klerk was taken aback by my response. Instead of replying, he continued to relate the plan for my release. He said that the government would\nfly me to Johannesburg and officially release me there. Before he went any further, I told him that I strongly objected to that. I wanted to walk out of\nthe gates of Victor Verster and be able to thank those who looked after me and greet the people of Cape Town. Though I was from Johannesburg,\nCape Town had been my home for nearly three decades. I would make my way back to Johannesburg, but when I chose to, not when the\ngovernment wanted me to. \u201cOnce I am free,\u201d I said, \u201cI will look after myself.\u201d\nDe Klerk was again nonplused. But this time my objections caused a reaction. He excused himself and left his office to consult with others. After\nten minutes he returned with a rather long face and said, \u201cMr. Mandela, it is too late to change the plan now.\u201d I replied that the plan was\nunacceptable and that I wanted to be released a week hence and at Victor Verster, not Johannesburg. It was a tense moment and, at the time,\nneither of us saw any irony in a prisoner asking not to be released and his jailer attempting to release him.\nDe Klerk again excused himself and left the room. After ten minutes he returned with a compromise: yes, I could be released at Victor Verster,\nbut, no, the release could not be postponed. The government had already informed the foreign press that I was to be set free tomorrow and felt they\ncould not renege on that statement. I felt I could not argue with that. In the end, we agreed on the compromise, and Mr. de Klerk poured a tumbler of\nwhisky for each of us to drink in celebration. I raised the glass in a toast, but only pretended to drink; such spirits are too strong for me.\nI did not get back to my cottage until shortly before midnight, whereupon I immediately sent word to my colleagues in Cape Town that I was to be\nreleased the following day. I managed to get a message to Winnie and I telephoned Walter in Johannesburg. They would all fly in on a chartered\nplane the next day. That evening, a number of ANC people on what was known as the National Reception Committee came to the cottage to draft a\nstatement that I would make the following day. They left in the early hours of the morning, and despite my excitement, I had no trouble falling asleep. MY FIRST RESPONSIBILITY was to report to the leadership of the ANC, and on February , when I had been out of prison a little over two weeks,\nI flew to Lusaka for a meeting of the National Executive Committee. It was a wonderful reunion to be with old comrades whom I had not seen in\ndecades. A number of African heads of state were also in attendance, and I had brief talks with Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Kenneth Kaunda of\nZambia, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola, Quett Masire of Botswana, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda.\nWhile the members of the executive were pleased that I had been freed, they were also eager to evaluate the man who had been released. I\ncould see the questions in their eyes. Was Mandela the same man who went to prison twenty-seven years before, or was this a different Mandela, a\nreformed Mandela? Had he survived or had he been broken? They had heard reports of my conversations with the government and they were\nrightly concerned. I had not only been out of touch with the situation on the ground \u2014 since  I had not even been able to communicate with my\ncolleagues in prison.\nI carefully and soberly explained the nature of my talks with the government. I described the demands I had made, and the progress that had been\nachieved. They had seen the memoranda I had written to Botha and de Klerk, and knew that these documents adhered to ANC policy. I knew that\nover the previous few years some of the men who had been released had gone to Lusaka and whispered, \u201cMadiba has become soft. He has been\nbought off by the authorities. He is wearing three-piece suits, drinking wine, and eating fine food.\u201d I knew of these whispers, and I intended to refute\nthem. I knew that the best way to disprove them was simply to be direct and honest about everything that I had done.\nAt that session of the NEC I was elected deputy president of the organization while Alfred Nzo, the organization\u2019s secretary-general, was named\nacting president while Oliver was recuperating. At a press conference after our meeting, I was asked about a suggestion made by Dr. Kaunda, the\npresident of Zambia and a longtime supporter of the Congress, that the ANC should suspend armed operations inside South Africa now that I had\nbeen released. I replied that while we valued Mr. Kaunda\u2019s wisdom and support, it was too soon to suspend the armed struggle, for we had not yet\nachieved the goal for which we took up arms; it was not the ANC\u2019s job, I said, to help Mr. de Klerk placate his right-wing supporters.\nI began a tour of Africa, which included many countries. During the first six months after my release, I spent more time abroad than at home.\nNearly everywhere I went there were great enthusiastic crowds so that even if I felt weary the people buoyed me. In Dar es Salaam I was met by a\ncrowd estimated at half a million.\nI enjoyed my travels immensely. I wanted to see new \u2014 and old \u2014 sights, taste different foods, speak with all manner of people. I very quickly had\nto acclimatize myself to a world radically different from the one I had left. With changes in travel, communication, and mass media, the world had\naccelerated; things now happened so fast it was sometimes difficult to keep up with them. Winnie tried to get me to slow down, but there was\nsimply too much to do; the organization wanted to make sure we took advantage of the euphoria generated by my release.\nIn Cairo, the day after a private meeting with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, I was scheduled to address a large meeting in a local hall.\nWhen I arrived, the crowd seemed to be spilling out of the building and there was precious little security. I mentioned to a policeman that I thought\nhe needed reinforcements but he merely shrugged. Winnie and I waited in a room behind the hall, and at the appointed hour, a policeman motioned\nfor me to go in. I told him to escort the rest of my delegation in first because I feared that when I went in there would be pandemonium and they\nwould be cut off. But the policeman urged me to go first, and indeed as soon as I was in the hall, the crowd surged forward and overcame the\ncordon of policemen. In their enthusiasm, I was jostled and a bit shaken, and at one point I lost my shoe in the general confusion. When things\nbegan to calm down a few minutes later, I found that neither my shoe nor my wife could be located. Finally, after nearly half an hour, Winnie was\nbrought onto the stage with me, quite cross that she had been lost. I was not able to even address the crowd, for they were shouting \u201cMandela!\nMandela!\u201d so furiously that I could not be heard above the din, and finally I left, without my shoe and with an uncharacteristically silent wife.\nWhile in Cairo I held a press conference at which I said the ANC was \u201cprepared to consider a cessation of hostilities.\u201d This was a signal to the\ngovernment. Both the ANC and the government were engaged in creating a climate whereby negotiations would succeed. While the ANC was\ndemanding that the government normalize the situation in the country by ending the State of Emergency, releasing all political prisoners, and\nrepealing all apartheid laws, the government was intent on first persuading the ANC to suspend the armed struggle. While we were not yet ready to\nannounce such a suspension, we wanted to provide Mr. de Klerk with enough encouragement to pursue his reformist strategies. We knew that we\nwould eventually suspend the armed struggle, in part to facilitate more serious negotiations and in part to allow Mr. de Klerk to go to his own\nconstituency, the white voters of South Africa, and say, \u201cLook, here are the fruits of my policy.\u201d\nAfter my last stop in Africa, I flew to Stockholm to visit Oliver. Seeing my old friend and law partner was the reunion I most looked forward to.\nOliver was not well, but when we met we were like two young boys in the veld who took strength from our love for each other. We began by talking of\nold times, but when we were alone, the first subject he raised was the leadership of the organization. \u201cNelson,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must now take over as\npresident of the ANC. I have been merely keeping the job warm for you.\u201d I refused, telling him that he had led the organization in exile far better than\nI ever could have. It was neither fair nor democratic for a transfer to occur in such a manner. \u201cYou have been elected by the organization as the\npresident,\u201d I said. \u201cLet us wait for an election; then the organization can decide.\u201d Oliver protested, but I would not budge. It was a sign of his humility\nand selflessness that he wanted to appoint me president, but it was not in keeping with the principles of the ANC.\nIn April , I flew to London to attend a concert at Wembley, held in my honor. Many international artists, most of whom I never knew, were\nperforming and the event was to be televised worldwide. I took advantage of this to thank the world\u2019s anti-apartheid forces for the tremendous work\nthey had done in pressing for sanctions, for the release of myself and fellow political prisoners, and for the genuine support and solidarity they had\nshown the oppressed people of my country. WHEN I EMERGED from prison, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the head of the Inkatha Freedom Party and the chief minister of KwaZulu, was one of\nthe premier players on the South African political stage. But within ANC circles, he was a far from popular figure. Chief Buthelezi was descended\nfrom the great Zulu king Cetywayo, who had defeated the British at the Battle of Isandhlwana in . As a young man, he attended Fort Hare and\nthen joined the ANC Youth League. I saw him as one of the movement\u2019s upcoming young leaders. He had become chief minister of the KwaZulu\nhomeland with the tacit support of the ANC, and even his launching of Inkatha as a Zulu cultural organization was unopposed by the organization.\nBut over the years, Chief Buthelezi drifted away from the ANC. Though he resolutely opposed apartheid and refused to allow KwaZulu to become\nan \u201cindependent\u201d homeland as the government wished, he was a thorn in the side of the democratic movement. He opposed the armed struggle.\nHe criticized the  Soweto uprising. He campaigned against international sanctions. He challenged the idea of a unitary state of South Africa.\nYet, Chief Buthelezi had consistently called for my release and refused to negotiate with the government until I and other political prisoners were\nliberated.\nChief Buthelezi was one of the first people I telephoned after my release to thank him for his long-standing support. My inclination was to meet\nwith the chief as soon as possible to try to resolve our differences. During my initial visit to Lusaka, I brought up the idea of such a meeting and it\nwas voted down. While I was at Victor Verster, Walter had been invited by the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, to visit him in Ulundi, KwaZulu\u2019s capital,\nand I urged him to accept. I thought it was an excellent opportunity to influence the head of one of the most respected and powerful royal families in\nthe country. The visit was tentatively approved by the NEC provided Walter went to the king\u2019s palace in Nongoma; it was thought that going to\nUlundi would suggest recognition of the authority of the homeland.\nWhen I returned from Lusaka I telephoned both Chief Buthelezi and the king, and explained that Walter would be coming to see the king, not in\nUlundi but at Nongoma. The king said he would not accept Walter coming to see him anywhere else but in the capital. \u201cI am the king,\u201d he said. \u201cI\nhave invited him to see me in Ulundi, and he has no right to say I will see you elsewhere.\u201d \u201cYour Majesty,\u201d I said, \u201cwe are facing a wall of opposition\nfrom our membership who did not want Mr. Sisulu to go to KwaZulu at all. We managed to get this compromise approved, surely you can bend as\nwell.\u201d But he could not, and he refused to see Walter.\nRelations deteriorated after this, and in May, I persuaded the ANC of the need for me to make a visit to the king and Buthelezi. The king\napproved, but a week or so before the visit I received a letter from him saying I must come alone. This proved to be the last straw, and the NEC\nwould not give in to such a demand. I told the king that I could not come unless I was accompanied by my colleagues; the king regarded this as\nanother slight and canceled the visit.\nMy goal was to forge an independent relationship with the king, separate from my relationship with Chief Buthelezi. The king was the true\nhereditary leader of the Zulus, who loved and respected him. Fidelity to the king was far more widespread in KwaZulu than allegiance to Inkatha.\nIn the meantime, Natal became a killing ground. Heavily armed Inkatha supporters had in effect declared war on ANC strongholds across the\nNatal Midlands region and around Pietermaritzburg. Entire villages were set alight, dozens of people were killed, hundreds were wounded, and\nthousands became refugees. In March  alone,  people lost their lives in this internecine violence. In Natal, Zulu was murdering Zulu, for\nInkatha members and ANC partisans are Zulus. In February, only two weeks after my release, I went to Durban and spoke to a crowd of over\n, people at King\u2019s Park, almost all of whom were Zulus. I pleaded with them to lay down their arms, to take each other\u2019s hands in peace:\n\u201cTake your guns, your knives, and your pangas, and throw them into the sea! Close down the death factories. End this war now!\u201d But my call fell on\ndeaf ears. The fighting and dying continued.\nI was so concerned that I was willing to go to great lengths to meet Chief Buthelezi. In March, after one particularly horrifying spasm of violence, I\nannounced on my own that I would meet Chief Buthelezi at a mountain hamlet outside of Pietermaritzburg. On a personal level, my relations with\nChief Buthelezi were close and respectful, and I hoped to capitalize on that. But I found that such a meeting was anathema to ANC leaders in Natal.\nThey considered it dangerous and vetoed my meeting. I did go to Pietermaritzburg, where I saw the burned remains of ANC supporters and tried to\ncomfort their grieving families, but I did not see Chief Buthelezi. IN MARCH, after much negotiation within our respective parties, we scheduled our first face-to-face meeting with Mr. de Klerk and the government.\nThese were to be \u201ctalks about talks,\u201d and the meetings were to begin in early April. But on March , in Sebokeng Township, about thirty miles\nsouth of Johannesburg, the police opened fire without warning on a crowd of ANC demonstrators, killing twelve and wounding hundreds more, most\nof them shot in the back as they were fleeing. Police had used live ammunition in dealing with the demonstrators, which was intolerable. The police\nclaimed that their lives were endangered, but many demonstrators were shot in the back and had no weapons. You cannot be in danger from an\nunarmed man who is running away from you. The right to assemble and demonstrate in support of our just demands was not a favor to be granted\nby the government at its discretion. This sort of action angered me like no other, and I told the press that every white policeman in South Africa\nregarded every black person as a military target. After consultation with the NEC, I announced the suspension of our talks and warned Mr. de Klerk\nthat he could not \u201ctalk about negotiations on the one hand and murder our people on the other.\u201d\nBut despite the suspension of our official talks, with the approval of the leadership, I met privately with Mr. de Klerk in Cape Town in order to keep\nup the momentum for negotiations. Our discussions centered primarily on a new date, and we agreed on early May. I brought up the appalling\nbehavior at Sebokeng and the police\u2019s unequal treatment of blacks and whites; police used live ammunition with black demonstrators, while they\nnever unsheathed their guns at white right-wing protests.\nThe government was in no great rush to begin negotiations; they were counting on the euphoria that greeted my release to die down. They\nwanted to allow time for me to fall on my face and show that the former prisoner hailed as a savior was a highly fallible man who had lost touch with\nthe present situation.\nDespite his seemingly progressive actions, Mr. de Klerk was by no means the great emancipator. He was a gradualist, a careful pragmatist. He\ndid not make any of his reforms with the intention of putting himself out of power. He made them for precisely the opposite reason: to ensure power\nfor the Afrikaner in a new dispensation. He was not yet prepared to negotiate the end of white rule.\nHis goal was to create a system of power-sharing based on group rights, which would preserve a modified form of minority power in South\nAfrica. He was decidedly opposed to majority rule, or \u201csimple majoritarianism\u201d as he sometimes called it, because that would end white domination\nin a single stroke. We knew early on that the government was fiercely opposed to a winner-takes-all Westminster parliamentary system, and\nadvocated instead a system of proportional representation with built-in structural guarantees for the white minority. Although he was prepared to\nallow the black majority to vote and create legislation, he wanted to retain a minority veto. From the start I would have no truck with this plan. I\ndescribed it to Mr. de Klerk as apartheid in disguise, a \u201closer-takes-all\u201d system.\nThe Nationalists\u2019 long-term strategy to overcome our strength was to build an anti-ANC alliance with the Inkatha Freedom Party and to lure the\nColoured Afrikaans-speaking voters of the Cape to a new National Party. From the moment of my release, they began wooing both Buthelezi and\nthe Coloured voters of the Cape. The government attempted to scare the Coloured population into thinking the ANC was anti-Coloured. They\nsupported Chief Buthelezi\u2019s desire to retain Zulu power and identity in a new South Africa by preaching to him the doctrine of group rights and\nfederalism.\n\nThe first round of talks with the government was held over three days in early May. Our delegation consisted of Walter Sisulu, Joe Slovo, Alfred Nzo,\nThabo Mbeki, Ahmed Kathrada, Joe Modise, Ruth Mompati, Archie Gumede, Reverend Beyers Naude, Cheryl Carolus, and myself. The setting\nwas Groote Schuur, the Cape Dutch-style mansion that was the residence of South Africa\u2019s first colonial governors, among them Cecil Rhodes.\nSome of our delegation joked that we were being led into an ambush on the enemy\u2019s ground.\nBut the talks, contrary to expectation, were conducted with seriousness and good humor. Historic enemies who had been fighting each other for\nthree centuries met and shook hands. Many wondered out loud why such discussions had not taken place long before. The government had\ngranted temporary indemnities to Joe Slovo, the general secretary of the Communist Party, and Joe Modise, the commander of MK, and to see\nthese two men shaking hands with the National Party leaders who had demonized them for decades was extraordinary. As Thabo Mbeki later said\nto reporters, each side had discovered that the other did not have horns.\nThe very fact of the talks themselves was a significant milestone in the history of our country; as I pointed out, the meeting represented not only\nwhat the ANC had been seeking for so many years, but an end to the master/servant relationship that characterized black and white relations in\nSouth Africa. We had not come to the meeting as supplicants or petitioners, but as fellow South Africans who merited an equal place at the table.\nThe first day was more or less a history lesson. I explained to our counterparts that the ANC from its inception in  had always sought\nnegotiations with the government in power. Mr. de Klerk, for his part, suggested that the system of separate development had been conceived as a\nbenign idea, but had not worked in practice. For that, he said, he was sorry, and hoped the negotiations would make amends. It was not an apology\nfor apartheid, but it went further than any other National Party leader ever had.\nThe primary issue discussed was the definition of political prisoners and political exiles. The government argued for a narrow definition, wanting\nto restrict the number of our people who would qualify for an indemnity. We argued for the broadest possible definition and said that any person\nwho was convicted of an offense that was politically motivated should qualify for an indemnity. We could not agree on a mutually satisfactory\ndefinition of \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d crimes, and this would be an issue that would bedevil us for quite a while to come.\nAt the end of the three-day meeting, we agreed on what became known as the Groote Schuur Minute, pledging both sides to a peaceful process\nof negotiations and committing the government to lifting the State of Emergency, which they shortly did everywhere except for the violence-ridden\nprovince of Natal. We agreed to set up a joint working group to resolve the many obstacles that still stood in our way.\nWhen it came to constitutional issues, we told the government we were demanding an elected constituent assembly to draw up a new\nconstitution; we believed that the men and women creating the constitution should be the choice of the people themselves. But before the election\nof an assembly, it was necessary to have an interim government that could oversee the transition until a new government was elected. The\ngovernment could not be both player and referee, as it was now. We advocated the creation of a multiparty negotiating conference to set up the\ninterim government and set out the guiding principles for the functioning of a constituent assembly.\n WHEN I RETURNED to South Africa in July, after brief trips to Uganda, Kenya, and Mozambique, I requested a meeting with Mr. de Klerk. Violence\nin the country was worsening; the death toll of  was already over fifteen hundred, more than all the political deaths of the previous year. After\nconferring with my colleagues, I felt it necessary to speed up the process of normalization. Our country was bleeding to death, and we had to move\nahead faster.\nMr. de Klerk\u2019s lifting the State of Emergency in June seemed to set the stage for a resumption of talks, but in July, government security forces\narrested about forty members of the ANC, including Mac Maharaj, Pravin Gordhan, Siphiwe Nyanda, and Billy Nair, claiming that they were part of\na Communist Party plot called Operation Vula to overthrow the government. De Klerk called for an urgent meeting with me and read to me from\ndocuments he claimed had been confiscated in the raid. I was taken aback because I knew nothing about it.\nAfter the meeting I wanted an explanation and called Joe Slovo. Joe explained that the passages read by Mr. de Klerk had been taken out of\ncontext and that Vula was a moribund operation. But the government was intent on using this discovery to try to pry the ANC from the SACP and\nkeep Joe Slovo out of the negotiations. I went back to Mr. de Klerk and told him that he had been misled by his own police and that we had no\nintention of parting ways with the SACP or dropping Joe Slovo from our negotiating team.\nIn the middle of July, shortly before a scheduled meeting of the National Executive Committee, Joe Slovo came to me privately with a proposition.\nHe suggested we voluntarily suspend the armed struggle in order to create the right climate to move the negotiation process forward. Mr. de Klerk,\nhe said, needed to show his supporters that his policy had brought benefits to the country. My first reaction was negative; I did not think the time\nwas ripe.\nBut the more I thought about it, the more I realized that we had to take the initiative and this was the best way to do it. I also recognized that Joe,\nwhose credentials as a radical were above dispute, was precisely the right person to make the proposal. He could not be accused of being a dupe\nof the government or of having gone soft. The following day I told Joe that if he brought up the idea in the NEC, I would support him.\nWhen Joe raised the idea in the NEC the next day there were some who firmly objected, claiming that we were giving de Klerk\u2019s supporters a\nreward but not our own people. But I defended the proposal, saying the purpose of the armed struggle was always to bring the government to the\nnegotiating table, and now we had done so. I argued that the suspension could always be withdrawn, but it was necessary to show our good faith.\nAfter several hours, our view prevailed.\nThis was a controversial move within the ANC. Although MK was not active, the aura of the armed struggle had great meaning for many people.\nEven when cited merely as a rhetorical device, the armed struggle was a sign that we were actively fighting the enemy. As a result, it had a\npopularity out of proportion to what it had achieved on the ground.\nOn August , in Pretoria, the ANC and the government signed what became known as the Pretoria Minute, in which we agreed to suspend the\narmed struggle. As I was to say over and over to our followers: we suspended armed action, we did not terminate the armed struggle. The\nagreement also set forth target dates for the release of political prisoners and the granting of certain types of indemnity. The process of indemnity\nwas scheduled to be completed by May , and the government also agreed to review the Internal Security Act.\n* * *\nOf all the issues that hindered the peace process, none was more devastating and frustrating than the escalation of violence in the country. We had\nall hoped that as negotiations got under way, violence would decrease. But in fact the opposite happened. The police and security forces were\nmaking very few arrests. People in the townships were accusing them of aiding and abetting the violence. It was becoming more and more clear to\nme that there was connivance on the part of the security forces. Many of the incidents indicated to me that the police, rather than quelling violence,\nwere fomenting it.\nOver the next few months, I visited townships all across the violence-racked Vaal Triangle south of Johannesburg, comforting wounded people\nand grieving families. Over and over again, I heard the same story: the police and the defense force were destabilizing the area. I was told of the\npolice confiscating weapons one day in one area, and then Inkatha forces attacking our people with those stolen weapons the next day. We heard\nstories of the police escorting Inkatha members to meetings and on their attacks.\nIn September, I gave a speech in which I said there was a hidden hand behind the violence and suggested that there was a mysterious \u201cThird\nForce,\u201d which consisted of renegade men from the security forces who were attempting to disrupt the negotiations. I could not say who the\nmembers of the Third Force were, for I did not know them myself, but I was certain that they existed and that they were murderously effective in their\ntargeting of the ANC and the liberation struggle.\nI came to this conclusion after becoming personally involved in two specific incidents. In July of , the ANC received information that hostel\ndwellers belonging to the Inkatha Freedom Party were planning a major attack on ANC members in Sebokeng Township in the Vaal Triangle on\nJuly . Through our attorneys, we notified the minister of law and order, the commissioner of police, and the regional commissioner, warning them\nof the impending attacks and urging them to take the proper action. We asked the police to prevent armed Inkatha members from entering the\ntownship to attend an Inkatha rally.\nOn July , busloads of armed Inkatha members, escorted by police vehicles, entered Sebokeng in broad daylight. A rally was held, after which\nthe armed men went on a rampage, murdering approximately thirty people in a dreadful and grisly attack. I visited the area the next day and\nwitnessed scenes I have never before seen and never hope to see again. At the morgue were bodies of people who had been hacked to death; a\nwoman had both her breasts cut off with a machete. Whoever these killers were, they were animals.\nI requested a meeting with Mr. de Klerk the following day. When I saw him, I angrily demanded an explanation. \u201cYou were warned in advance,\u201d I\ntold him, \u201cand yet did nothing. Why is that? Why is it that there have been no arrests? Why have the police sat on their hands?\u201d I then told him that in\nany other nation where there was a tragedy of this magnitude, when more than thirty people were slain, the head of state would make some\nstatement of condolence, yet he had not uttered a word. He had no reply to what I said. I asked de Klerk to furnish me with an explanation, and he\nnever did.\n\nThe second incident occurred in November, when a group of Inkatha members entered a squatter camp known as Zonkizizwe (Zulu for \u201cthe place\nwhere all nations are welcome\u201d) outside the city of Germiston, east of Johannesburg, and drove ANC people out, killing a number of them in the\nprocess. Inkatha members then proceeded to occupy the abandoned shacks and confiscate all the property. Residents of the area said that the\nInkatha members were accompanied by the police. Once again, in the wake of this tragedy, the police and the government took no action. Black\n\n\flife in South Africa had never been so cheap.\nAgain, I met with Mr. de Klerk and his minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok. Again, I asked Mr. de Klerk why no action by the police had been\ntaken in the aftermath of these crimes. I said the attackers could easily be found because they were now occupying the shacks of the people they\nhad killed. Mr. de Klerk asked Mr. Vlok for an explanation and then Vlok, in a rather rude tone, asked me on whose property the shacks were\nlocated, the implication being that these people were squatters and therefore had no rights. In fact, I told him, the land had been made available to\nthese people by the local authorities. His attitude was like that of many Afrikaners who simply believed that black tribes had been killing each other\nsince time immemorial. Mr. de Klerk again told me he would investigate and respond, but never did.\n\nDuring this time, the government took another action that added fuel to the flames. It introduced a regulation permitting Zulus to carry so-called\ntraditional weapons to political rallies and meetings in Natal and elsewhere. These weapons, assegais, which are spears, and knobkerries,\nwooden sticks with a heavy wooden head, are actual weapons with which Inkatha members killed ANC members. This gave me grave doubts\nabout Mr. de Klerk\u2019s peaceful intentions.\nThose opposed to negotiations benefited from the violence, which always seemed to flare up when the government and the ANC were moving\ntoward an agreement. These forces sought to ignite a war between the ANC and Inkatha, and I believe many members of Inkatha connived at this\nas well. Many in the government, including Mr. de Klerk, chose to look the other way or ignore what they knew was going on under their noses. We\nhad no doubts that men at the highest levels of the police and the security forces were aiding the Third Force. These suspicions were later\nconfirmed by newspaper reports disclosing that the South African police had secretly funded Inkatha.\nAs the violence continued to spiral, I began to have second thoughts about the suspension of the armed struggle. Many of the people in the ANC\nwere restive, and in September, at a press conference, I said that the continuing violence might necessitate taking up arms once more. The\nsituation looked very grim, and any understanding that had been achieved with the government seemed lost.\n IN DECEMBER OF  Oliver returned to South Africa after being in exile from his native land for three decades. It was wonderful to have him\nnear. He returned for an ANC consultative conference in Johannesburg, which was attended by over fifteen hundred delegates from forty-five\ndifferent regions, home and abroad.\nAt the meeting, I spoke in tribute to Oliver as the man who had led the ANC during its darkest hours and never let the flame go out. Now, he had\nushered us to the brink of a future that looked bright and hopeful. During the twenty-seven years that I was in prison, it was Oliver who saved the\nANC, and then built it into an international organization with power and influence. He took up the reins when most of its leaders were either in prison\nor in exile. He was a soldier, a diplomat, a statesman.\nAlthough I criticized the government for its orchestrated campaign of counterrevolutionary activities, it was Oliver\u2019s address that created a storm.\nHe opened the meeting with a controversial speech in which he called for our sanctions policy to be reevaluated. The ANC, he maintained, faced\n\u201cinternational marginalization\u201d unless it took the initiative to deescalate sanctions. The European Community had already begun to scale back\nsanctions. The countries in the West, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States, wanted to reward Mr. de Klerk for his reforms,\nbelieving that this would encourage him to go further. We felt this was the wrong strategy, but we had to recognize international realities.\nAlthough Oliver\u2019s speech had been discussed and approved by the NEC, his proposal was met with indignation by ANC militants, who insisted\nthat sanctions must be maintained unchanged. The conference decided to retain the sanctions policy as it was.\nI myself was the target of complaints by those who charged that the negotiators were out of touch with the grass roots and that we spent more\ntime with National Party leaders than our own people. I was also criticized at the conference for engaging in \u201cpersonal diplomacy\u201d and not keeping\nthe rank-and-file of the organization informed. As a leader of a mass organization, one must listen to the people, and I agreed that we had been\nremiss in keeping the entire organization informed about the course of the negotiations. But I also knew the delicacy of our talks with the\ngovernment; any agreements that we arrived at depended in part on their confidentiality. Although I accepted the criticism, I believed we had no\nalternative but to proceed on the same course. I knew that I had to be more inclusive, brief more people as to our progress, and I proceeded with\nthat in mind.\n\nEach day, each weekend, the newspapers were filled with fresh reports of new and bloody violence in our communities and townships. It was clear\nthat violence was the number one issue in the country. In many communities in Natal and on the Reef around Johannesburg, a poisonous mixture of\ncrime, political rivalries, police brutality, and shadowy death squads made life brutish and untenable. As long as the violence was not dealt with, the\nprogress to a new dispensation would remain uneven and uncertain.\nTo try to arrest the spiral of violence, I contacted Chief Buthelezi to arrange a meeting. We met at Durban\u2019s Royal Hotel in January. Chief\nButhelezi spoke first to assembled delegates and media and in the process opened old wounds rather than healing them. He catalogued the verbal\nattacks the ANC had made on him and criticized the ANC\u2019s negotiating demands. When it was my turn to speak, I chose not to respond to his\nremarks but to thank him for his efforts over many years to secure my release from prison. I cited our long relationship and underlined the many\nmatters that united our two organizations rather than divided us.\nProgress was made during our private talks, and Chief Buthelezi and I signed an agreement that contained a code of conduct covering the\nbehavior of our two organizations. It was a fair accord, and I suspect that if it had been implemented it would indeed have helped to staunch the\nbloodletting. But as far as I could tell, Inkatha never made any effort to implement the accord, and there were violations as well on our own side.\nThe violence continued between our two organizations. Each month people were dying by the hundreds. In March, Inkatha members launched an\nattack in Alexandra Township north of Johannesburg in which forty-five people were killed over three days of fighting. Again, no one was arrested.\nI could not sit idly by as the violence continued, and I sought another meeting with Chief Buthelezi. In April I went down to Durban and we again\nmade strong statements and signed another agreement. But again, the ink was no sooner dry than it was drenched in blood. I was more convinced\nthan ever that the government was behind much of the violence and the violence was impeding the negotiations. Mr. de Klerk\u2019s failure to respond\nput our own relationship in jeopardy.\nIn April, at a two-day meeting of the National Executive Committee, I discussed my doubts about Mr. de Klerk. The NEC believed that the\ngovernment was behind the violence and that the violence was upsetting the climate for negotiations. In an open letter to the government, we called\nfor the dismissal of Magnus Malan, the minister of defense, and Adriaan Vlok, the minister of law and order; the banning of the carrying of\ntraditional weapons in public; the phasing out of the migrant-worker hostels, where so many Inkatha members lived in the townships around\nJohannesburg; the dismantling of secret government counterinsurgency units; and the appointment of an independent commission to probe\ncomplaints of misconduct on the part of the security forces.\nWe gave the government until May to meet our demands. Mr. de Klerk responded by calling for a multiparty conference on violence to be held in\nMay, but I replied that this was pointless since the government knew precisely what it had to do to end the violence. In May, we announced the\nsuspension of talks with the government.\n\nIn July , the ANC held its first annual conference inside South Africa in thirty years. The conference was attended by , voting delegates\nwho were democratically elected at ANC branches at home and abroad. At the conference I was elected president of the ANC without opposition.\nCyril Ramaphosa was elected secretary-general, evidence that the torch was being passed from an older generation of leadership to a younger\none. Cyril, whom I met only upon my release from prison, was a worthy successor to a long line of notable ANC leaders. He was probably the most\naccomplished negotiator in the ranks of the ANC, a skill he honed as secretary-general of the National Union of Mine Workers.\nIn my speech I expressed my appreciation for the great honor that had been bestowed on me, and spoke of how difficult it would be to follow in\nthe large footsteps of my predecessor, Oliver Tambo. Though we were then at loggerheads with the government, negotiations in and of themselves,\nI said, constituted a victory. The mere fact that the government was engaged in negotiations at all was a sign that they did not have the strength to\nsustain apartheid. I reiterated that the process would not be smooth, as we were dealing with politicians who do not want to negotiate themselves\nout of power. \u201cThe point which must be clearly understood is that the struggle is not over, and negotiations themselves are a theater of struggle,\nsubject to advances and reverses as any other form of struggle.\u201d\nBut negotiations could not wait. It was never in our interest to prolong the agony of apartheid for any reason. It was necessary, I said, to create a\ntransitional government as soon as possible.\n\n\fThe conference underlined one of the most important and demanding tasks before the ANC: to transform an illegal underground liberation\nmovement to a legal mass political party. For thirty years, the ANC had functioned clandestinely in South Africa; those habits and techniques were\ndeeply ingrained. We had to reconstruct an entire organization, from the smallest local branch to the national executive. And we had to do so in a\nmatter of months during a period of extraordinary change.\nA large part of the ANC and Communist Party leadership had been in exile. Most of them had returned for the conference in July. They were\nunfamiliar with present-day South Africa; it was a newfound land for them as well as me. There was, however, an extraordinary crop of young\nleaders of the United Democratic Front and COSATU who had remained in the country, who knew the political situation in a way that we did not.\nThese organizations had in some measure been surrogates for the ANC inside South Africa during the s. The ANC had to integrate these\nmen and women into the organization as well.\nWe faced not only logistical problems but philosophical ones. It is a relatively simple proposition to keep a movement together when you are\nfighting against a common enemy. But creating a policy when that enemy is across the negotiating table is another matter altogether. In the new\nANC, we had to integrate not only many different groups, but many different points of view. We needed to unite the organization around the idea of\nthe negotiations.\nIn the first seventeen months of legal activity, the ANC had recruited , members. This was an impressive number, but there was no room\nfor complacency. A proportionately low number of these members were from the rural areas, the regions where the ANC had historically been\nweakest. At the same time, the National Party was throwing open its doors to nonwhites and was busily recruiting disaffected Coloureds and\nIndians.\n\nEver since my release from prison, the state had continued its campaign to discredit my wife. After the alleged kidnapping of four youths who were\nstaying in the Diepkloof house and the death of one of them, Winnie had first been vilified by a whispering campaign and was then charged with\nfour counts of kidnapping and one of assault. The continuing aspersions cast on her character were such that both Winnie and I were eager for her\nto have her day in court and prove her innocence of the charges.\nMy wife\u2019s formal trial began in February in the Rand Supreme Court in Johannesburg. I attended the trial on the first day, as did many senior\nfigures in the ANC, and I continued to attend as often as I could. I did this both to support my wife and to show my belief in her innocence. She was\nably defended by George Bizos, who attempted to demonstrate that Winnie had no involvement with either the kidnappings or the beatings.\nAfter three and a half months, the court found her guilty of kidnapping charges and being an accessory to assault. The judge, however,\nacknowledged that she had not taken part in any assault herself. She was sentenced to six years in prison, but was released on bail pending her\nappeal. As far as I was concerned, verdict or no verdict, her innocence was not in doubt. ON DECEMBER , , after more than a year and a half of talks about talks, the real talks began: CODESA \u2014 the Convention for a\nDemocratic South Africa \u2014 represented the first formal negotiations forum between the government, the ANC, and other South African parties. All\nof our previous bilateral discussions had been laying the groundwork for these talks, which took place at the World Trade Centre, a modern\nexhibition center near Jan Smuts Airport in Johannesburg. CODESA comprised eighteen delegations covering the gamut of South African politics,\nplus observers from the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the European Community, and the Organization of African Unity. It was the widest\ncross section of political groups ever gathered in one place in South Africa.\nThe opening of such talks was an historic occasion, certainly the most important constitutional convention since that of  when the British\ncolonies of the Cape and Natal and the former Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State agreed to form a single union. Of course,\nthat convention was not a tribute to democracy but a betrayal of it, for none of the representatives there that day were black. In , the majority of\nthem were.\nOur planning delegation, led by Cyril Ramaphosa, and including Joe Slovo and Valli Moosa, had been engaged in weekly discussions with the\ngovernment on the issues of elections, the constitution, a constituent assembly, and a transitional government. Delegates from twenty different\nparties including the homeland governments had already agreed on the ground rules for the convention.\nThe optimism at the opening of the talks could not be dampened even by a few spoilers. The PAC decided to boycott the talks, accusing the\nANC and the National Party of conspiring together to set up a multiracial government. This occurred despite the formation, a month before, of the\nPatriotic Front, an alliance of the ANC, the PAC, and the Azanian People\u2019s Organization around a declaration of common goals. The PAC feared\ndemocratic elections because they knew such a vote would expose their meager popular support. Chief Buthelezi also boycotted the talks on the\ngrounds that he was not permitted three delegations: for Inkatha, the KwaZulu government, and King Zwelithini. We argued that the king should be\nabove politics, and that if he were included then every tribe in South Africa should be able to send their paramount chief.\nThere was not only a sense of history at the World Trade Centre, but of self-reliance. Unlike the negotiations preceding new dispensations in\nAfrican states like Zimbabwe and Angola, which required outside mediators, we in South Africa were settling our differences among ourselves. Mr.\nde Klerk talked about the need for a transitional, \u201cpower-sharing\u201d government on a democratic basis. The National Party\u2019s chief delegate to the\ntalks, Dawie de Villiers, even offered an apology for apartheid.\nIn my own opening remarks, I said that with the dawn of CODESA, progress in South Africa had at last become irreversible. Governments, I said,\nderive their authority and legitimacy from the consent of the governed, and we had assembled to create such a legitimate authority. I said that\nCODESA marked the beginning of the road to an elected assembly that would write a new constitution, and I did not see any reason why an\nelection for such a constituent assembly could not occur in . I called on the government to usher in an interim government of national unity to\nsupervise such an election, control the state media and the military, and generally oversee the transition to a new, nonracial, democratic South\nAfrica.\nOn the convention\u2019s first day, the lion\u2019s share of the participating parties, including the National Party and the ANC, endorsed a Declaration of\nIntent, which committed all parties to support an undivided South Africa whose supreme law would be a constitution safeguarded by an\nindependent judiciary. The country\u2019s legal system would guarantee equality before the law, and a bill of rights would be drawn up to protect civil\nliberties. In short, there would be a multiparty democracy based on universal adult suffrage on a common voters\u2019 roll. As far as we were concerned,\nthis was the minimum acceptable constitutional threshold for a new South Africa. Inkatha refused to sign on the grounds that the phrase an\n\u201cundivided\u201d South Africa implied that a federal system was off-limits.\nThe convention created five working groups that would meet in early  to prepare the way for the second round of CODESA scheduled for\nMay . The groups would explore the question of creating a free political climate, the future of the homelands, the restructuring of the South\nAfrican Broadcasting Corporation, the examination of various constitutional principles such as federalism, and the creation and installation of an\ninterim government. The parties agreed that decisions would be taken by \u201csufficient consensus,\u201d which was never defined, but in practice meant an\nagreement between the government and the ANC and a majority of the other parties.\nThe first day of CODESA  was uneventful, until it came to a close. The night before the convention I had been negotiating with Mr. de Klerk on\nthe telephone until after eight in the evening. Mr. de Klerk asked me whether I would agree to permit him to be the final speaker the next day.\nThough I was scheduled to give the concluding remarks, I told him that I would take up the matter with our National Executive Committee. I did so\nthat evening, and despite their misgivings, I persuaded them to permit Mr. de Klerk to have the last word. I did not see the issue as a vital one, and I\nwas prepared to do Mr. de Klerk the favor.\nAt the end of the session, all seemed well; I spoke about the importance of the talks and I was followed by Mr. de Klerk. He proceeded to\nunderline the historic significance of the occasion and discuss the need for overcoming mutual distrust. But then Mr. de Klerk did a curious thing.\nHe began to attack the ANC for not adhering to the agreements that we had made with the government. He began to speak to us like a\nschoolmaster admonishing a naughty child. He berated the ANC for failing to disclose the location of arms caches and then rebuked us for\nmaintaining a \u201cprivate army,\u201d Umkhonto we Sizwe, in violation of the National Peace Accord of September . In intemperate language, he\nquestioned whether the ANC was honorable enough to abide by any agreements it signed.\nThis was more than I could tolerate and I would now be damned if I would permit Mr. de Klerk to have the last word. When he finished, the\nmeeting was meant to be over. But the room had grown very quiet; instead of allowing the session to end, I walked to the podium. I could not let his\nremarks go unchallenged. My voice betrayed my anger.\nI am gravely concerned about the behavior of Mr. de Klerk today. He has launched an attack on the ANC and in doing so he has been less than frank. Even the head of an\nillegitimate, discredited minority regime, as his is, has certain moral standards to uphold. He has no excuse just because he is the head of such a discredited regime not to uphold\nmoral standards. . . . If a man can come to a conference of this nature and play the type of politics he has played \u2014 very few people would like to deal with such a man.\nThe members of the government persuaded us to allow them to speak last. They were very keen to say the last word here. It is now clear why they did so. He has abused his\nposition, because he hoped that I would not respond. He was completely mistaken. I respond now.\n\nI said it was unacceptable for Mr. de Klerk to speak to us in such language. I reiterated that it was the ANC, not the government, that started the\ninitiative of peace discussions, and it was the government, not the ANC, that time and again failed to live up to its agreements. I had told Mr. de\nKlerk before that it served no useful purpose to attack the ANC publicly, yet he continued to do so. I noted that we had suspended our armed\nstruggle to show our commitment to peace, yet the government was still colluding with those waging war. We told him that we would turn in our\nweapons only when we were a part of the government collecting those weapons.\nI added that it was apparent the government had a double agenda. They were using the negotiations not to achieve peace, but to score their own\npetty political gains. Even while negotiating, they were secretly funding covert organizations that committed violence against us. I mentioned the\n\n\frecent revelations about million-rand payoffs to Inkatha that Mr. de Klerk claimed not to have known about. I stated that if a man in his position\n\u201cdoesn\u2019t know about such things, then he is not fit to be the head of government.\u201d\nI knew I had been harsh, but I did not want to capsize the whole ship of negotiations, and I ended on a more conciliatory note.\nI ask him to place his cards on the table face upwards. Let us work together openly. Let there be no secret agendas. Let him not persuade us that he would be the last speaker\nbecause he wants to abuse that privilege and attack us in the hope that we won\u2019t respond. I am prepared to work with him in spite of all his mistakes.\n\nCODESA convened the following day for its final session, and both Mr. de Klerk and I took pains to show that no irreparable harm had been\ndone. At the beginning of the session, he and I publicly shook hands and said we would work together. But much trust had been lost, and the\nnegotiations were now in a state of disarray.\n\nSix weeks after the opening of CODESA , the National Party contested an important by-election in Potchefstroom, a conservative university town\nin the Transvaal, traditionally the party\u2019s stronghold. In a stunning upset, the Nationalists were defeated by the candidate of the right-wing\nConservative Party. The Conservatives resolutely opposed the government\u2019s policy of negotiations with the ANC, and were composed mainly of\nAfrikaners who felt that Mr. de Klerk was giving away the store. The election result seemed to cast doubt on Mr. de Klerk\u2019s policy of reform and\nnegotiations. The National Party was alarmed; these were their own voters in their own heartland rejecting their policies.\nMr. de Klerk decided to gamble. He announced that as a result of the by-election in Potchefstroom he would call a nationwide referendum for\nMarch  so that the white people of South Africa could vote on his reform policy and on negotiations with the ANC. He stated that if the referendum\nwas defeated, he would resign from office. The referendum asked a plain and direct question of all white voters over the age of eighteen: \u201cDo you\nsupport the continuation of the reform process which the state president began on  February  which is aimed at a new constitution through\nnegotiation?\u201d\nThe ANC opposed the referendum on the principle that it was a vote that excluded all nonwhites. At the same time, we were realistic: we certainly\ndid not want white voters to rebuff Mr. de Klerk\u2019s efforts to pursue negotiations. Though we disdained the election on principle, we urged whites to\nvote yes. We saw such a vote as a signal of support for negotiations, not necessarily for de Klerk.\nWe watched Mr. de Klerk\u2019s campaign with interest and some consternation. He and the National Party conducted a sophisticated, expensive,\nAmerican-style political campaign accompanied by extensive newspaper and television advertisements, bumper stickers, and colorful rallies. We\nsaw this as a dress rehearsal for the campaign Mr. de Klerk would wage against us.\nIn the end,  percent of the white voters supported negotiations, giving de Klerk a great victory. He felt vindicated; I think the margin even\nswelled his head a bit. His hand was strengthened, and as a result, the Nationalists toughened their negotiating positions. This was a dangerous\nstrategy. ON APRIL , , at a press conference in Johannesburg, flanked by my two oldest friends and comrades, Walter and Oliver, I announced my\nseparation from my wife. The situation had grown so difficult that I felt that it was in the best interests of all concerned \u2014 the ANC, the family, and\nWinnie \u2014 that we part. Although I discussed the matter with the ANC, the separation itself was made for personal reasons.\nI read the following statement.\nThe relationship between myself and my wife, Comrade Nomzamo Winnie Mandela, has become the subject of much media speculation. I am issuing this statement to clarify the\nposition and in the hope that it will bring an end to further conjecture.\nComrade Nomzamo and myself contracted our marriage at a critical time in the struggle for liberation in our country. Owing to the pressures of our shared commitment to the\nANC and the struggle to end apartheid, we were unable to enjoy a normal family life. Despite these pressures our love for each other and our devotion to our marriage grew and\nintensified. . . .\nDuring the two decades I spent on Robben Island she was an indispensable pillar of support and comfort to myself personally. . . . Comrade Nomzamo accepted the onerous\nburden of raising our children on her own. . . . She endured the persecutions heaped upon her by the Government with exemplary fortitude and never wavered from her commitment\nto the freedom struggle. Her tenacity reinforced my personal respect, love and growing affection. It also attracted the admiration of the world at large. My love for her remains\nundiminished.\nHowever, in view of the tensions that have arisen owing to differences between ourselves on a number of issues in recent months, we have mutually agreed that a separation\nwould be best for each of us. My action was not prompted by the current allegations being made against her in the media. . . . Comrade Nomzamo has and can continue to rely on\nmy unstinting support during these trying moments in her life.\nI shall personally never regret the life Comrade Nomzamo and I tried to share together. Circumstances beyond our control however dictated it should be otherwise. I part from\nmy wife with no recriminations. I embrace her with all the love and affection I have nursed for her inside and outside prison from the moment I first met her. Ladies and gentlemen, I\nhope you will appreciate the pain I have gone through.\n\nPerhaps I was blinded to certain things because of the pain I felt for not being able to fulfill my role as a husband to my wife and a father to my\nchildren. But just as I am convinced that my wife\u2019s life while I was in prison was more difficult than mine, my own return was also more difficult for her\nthan it was for me. She married a man who soon left her; that man became a myth; and then that myth returned home and proved to be just a man\nafter all.\nAs I later said at my daughter Zindzi\u2019s wedding, it seems to be the destiny of freedom fighters to have unstable personal lives. When your life is\nthe struggle, as mine was, there is little room left for family. That has always been my greatest regret, and the most painful aspect of the choice I\nmade.\n\u201cWe watched our children growing without our guidance,\u201d I said at the wedding, \u201cand when we did come out [of prison], my children said, \u2018We\nthought we had a father and one day he\u2019d come back. But to our dismay, our father came back and he left us alone because he has now become\nthe father of the nation.\u2019 \u201d To be the father of a nation is a great honor, but to be the father of a family is a greater joy. But it was a joy I had far too\nlittle of. IN MAY OF , after a four-month interruption, the multiparty conference held its second plenary session at the World Trade Centre. Known as\nCODESA , the talks had been prepared by secret meetings between negotiators from both the ANC and the government as well as talks between\nthe ANC and other parties. These meetings culminated in a final session between me and Mr. de Klerk the day before the opening of CODESA ,\nthe first time the two of us had met since before CODESA .\nOnly days before CODESA  was to begin, the government was hit by two scandals. The first involved the revelation of massive corruption and\nbribery at the Department of Development Aid, which was responsible for improving black life in the homelands, and the second was the\nimplication of high government security officials in the  murder of four UDF activists, the best known of whom was Matthew Goniwe. These\nrevelations were added to the recent evidence implicating the police in murders in Natal and suspicions that the Department of Military Intelligence\nwas conducting covert operations against the ANC. These two scandals coming together undermined the credibility of the government and\nstrengthened our hand.\nOver the previous months, the government had made numerous proposals that fell by the wayside. Most of them, like the idea of a rotating\npresidency, sought to preserve their power. But through negotiations over the past months, the ANC and government teams had put together a\ntentative agreement involving a two-stage transitional period to a fully democratic South Africa. In the first stage, a multiparty \u201ctransitional executive\ncouncil\u201d would be appointed from the CODESA delegations to function as a temporary government in order to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for all parties\nand create an interim constitution. In the second stage, general elections would be held for a constituent assembly and legislature in which all\npolitical parties winning  percent or more of the vote would participate in the cabinet. Half the members of the assembly would be elected on a\nnational basis and half on a regional one, and the assembly would be empowered both to write a new constitution and to pass legislation. An\nindependent commission would preside over the election and make sure it was free and fair.\nYet there were many matters on which the ANC and the government could not reach agreement, such as the percentage of voting necessary in\nthe assembly to decide constitutional issues and to agree on a bill of rights. Only days before CODESA , the government proposed a second\nbody, a senate, composed of regional representatives, as a way of ensuring a minority veto. They also proposed that before all this, CODESA \nfirst agree on an interim constitution, which would take months to draw up.\nAll of this bargaining was going on behind the scenes and by the time CODESA  opened on May , , prospects for agreement looked\nbleak. What we disagreed about was threatening all that we had agreed upon. Mr. de Klerk and I had not managed to find a consensus on most of\nthe outstanding issues. The government seemed prepared to wait indefinitely; their thinking was that the longer we waited, the more support we\nwould lose.\nThe convention was deadlocked at the end of the first day. At that time, the two judges presiding over the talks told Mr. de Klerk and me to meet\nthat evening to attempt to find a compromise. We did meet that night over coffee, and though we did not find a way out of the impasse, we agreed\nthat the negotiations must not founder. \u201cThe whole of South Africa and the world is looking at you and me,\u201d I told Mr. de Klerk. \u201cLet us save the\npeace process. Let us reach some kind of agreement. Let us at least fix a date for the next round of talks.\u201d We decided that we would each speak\nthe following day in a spirit of constructive compromise.\nThe next afternoon we spoke in the reverse order that we had agreed to at CODESA : Mr. de Klerk first and I last. In his remarks, Mr. de Klerk\ninsisted that the National Party did not seek a \u201cminority veto,\u201d but that he did want a system of \u201cchecks and balances\u201d so that the majority would not\nbe able \u201cto misuse its power.\u201d Although this certainly sounded to me like outright opposition to the idea of majority rule, when I spoke after Mr. de\nKlerk, I merely said we needed to work in a constructive manner and dispel the tensions around the negotiations.\nDespite our attempts to put a positive face on the matter, the convention ended the second day in a stalemate. The impasse, as I saw it, was\ncaused by the National Party\u2019s continuing reluctance to submit their fate to the will of the majority. They simply could not cross that hurdle.\nUltimately, CODESA  broke down on four fundamental issues: the government\u2019s insistence on an unacceptably high percentage of votes in the\nassembly to approve the constitution (essentially a backdoor veto); entrenched regional powers that would be binding on a future constitution; an\nundemocratic and unelected senate that had veto power over legislation from the main chamber; and a determination to make an interim\nconstitution negotiated by the convention into a permanent constitution.\nThese were all difficult issues, but not insoluble ones, and I was determined not to let the deadlock at CODESA  subvert the negotiation\nprocess. The government and the ANC agreed to continue bilateral talks to work toward a solution. But, then, other matters intruded to render this\nimpossible.\n\nWith negotiations stalled, the ANC and its allies agreed on a policy of \u201crolling mass action,\u201d which would display to the government the extent of our\nsupport around the country and show that the people of South Africa were not prepared to wait forever for their freedom. The mass action consisted\nof strikes, demonstrations, and boycotts. The date chosen for the start of mass action was June , , the anniversary of the  Soweto\nrevolt, and the campaign was meant to culminate in a two-day national strike set for August  and .\nBut before that happened, another event occurred that drove the ANC and the government even further apart. On the night of June , , a\nheavily armed force of Inkatha members secretly raided the Vaal township of Boipatong and killed forty-six people. Most of the dead were women\nand children. It was the fourth mass killing of ANC people that week. People across the country were horrified by the violence and charged the\ngovernment with complicity. The police did nothing to stop the criminals and nothing to find them; no arrests were made, no investigation begun. Mr.\nde Klerk said nothing. I found this to be the last straw, and my patience snapped. The government was blocking the negotiations and at the same\ntime waging a covert war against our people. Why then were we continuing to talk with them?\nFour days after the murders, I addressed a crowd of twenty thousand angry ANC supporters and told them I had instructed ANC secretarygeneral Cyril Ramaphosa to suspend direct dealings with the government. I also announced an urgent meeting of the National Executive\nCommittee to examine our options. It was as if we had returned to the dark days of Sharpeville. I likened the behavior of the National Party to the\nNazis in Germany, and publicly warned de Klerk that if he sought to impose new measures to restrict demonstrations or free expression, the ANC\nwould launch a nationwide defiance campaign with myself as the first volunteer.\nAt the rally, I saw signs that read, \u201cMANDELA, GIVE US GUNS\u201d and \u201cVICTORY THROUGH BATTLE NOT TALK.\u201d I understood such sentiments;\nthe people were frustrated. They saw no positive results of the negotiations. They were beginning to think that the only way to overthrow apartheid\nwas through the barrel of a gun. After Boipatong, there were those in the NEC who said, \u201cWhy did we abandon the armed struggle? We should\nabandon negotiations instead; they will never advance us to our goal.\u201d I was initially sympathetic to this group of hardliners, but gradually realized\nthat there was no alternative to the process. It was what I had been urging for so many years, and I would not turn my back on negotiations. But it\n\n\fwas time to cool things down. Mass action in this case was a middle course between armed struggle and negotiations. The people must have an\noutlet for their anger and frustration, and a mass action campaign was the best way to channel those emotions.\nWhen we informed the government that we were suspending talks, we sent Mr. de Klerk a memo outlining the reasons for our withdrawal. In\naddition to resolving the constitutional deadlocks at CODESA , we demanded that the people responsible for the violence be tracked down and\nbrought to justice and that some mechanism be found for fencing in and policing the hostels, the seedbeds of so much violence. Mr. de Klerk sent\nus back a memo asking for a face-to-face meeting with me, which we rebuffed. I felt such a meeting would suggest that we had something to talk\nabout, and at the time we did not.\n* * *\nThe mass action campaign culminated in a general strike on August  and  in support of the ANC\u2019s negotiation demands and in protest against\nstate-supported violence. More than four million workers stayed home in what was the largest political strike in South African history. The\ncenterpiece of the strike was a march of one hundred thousand people to the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the imposing seat of the South African\ngovernment, where we held an enormous outdoor rally on the great lawn in front of the buildings. I told the crowd that we one day would occupy\nthese buildings as the first democratically elected government of South Africa.\nIn the face of this mass action, Mr. de Klerk said that if the ANC made the country ungovernable, the government might be forced to consider\nsome unpleasant options. I warned Mr. de Klerk that any antidemocratic actions would have serious repercussions. It was because of such threats,\nI said, that it was absolutely critical to set up a transitional government.\nInspired by the success of the mass action campaign, a group within the ANC decided to march on Bisho, the capital of the Ciskei homeland in\nthe eastern Cape, a bantustan led by Brigadier Oupa Gqozo. The Ciskei had a history of repression against the ANC and in  Brigadier Gqozo\nhad declared a State of Emergency in the Ciskei to curtail what he called ANC-sponsored terrorism. On the morning of September , ,\nseventy thousand protesters set out on a march to Bisho\u2019s main stadium. When a group of marchers attempted to run through an opening in a fence\nand take a different path to town, the poorly trained homeland troops opened fire on the marchers and killed twenty-nine people, wounding over two\nhundred. Now Bisho joined Boipatong as a byword for brutality.\n\nLike the old proverb that says that the darkest hour is before the dawn, the tragedy of Bisho led to a new opening in the negotiations. I met with Mr.\nde Klerk in order to find common ground and avoid a repetition of another tragedy like Bisho. Our respective negotiators began meeting regularly.\nBoth sides were making a good-faith effort to get the negotiations back on track, and on September , Mr. de Klerk and I met for an official\nsummit.\nOn that day, Mr. de Klerk and I signed the Record of Understanding, an agreement which set the mold for all the negotiations that followed. The\nagreement established an independent body to review police actions, created a mechanism to fence in the hostels, and banned the display of\n\u201ctraditional weapons\u201d at rallies. But the real importance of the Record of Understanding was that it broke the constitutional deadlock of CODESA .\nThe government finally agreed to accept a single, elected constitutional assembly, which would adopt a new constitution and serve as a transitional\nlegislature for the new government. All that was left to negotiate was a date for the election of the assembly and the percentage of majorities\nnecessary for it to reach its decisions. We were now aligned on the basic framework that would take the country into a democratic future.\nThe Record of Understanding prompted Inkatha to announce its withdrawal from all negotiations involving the government and the ANC. The\nagreement infuriated Chief Buthelezi, who severed relations with the NP and formed an alliance with a group of discredited homeland leaders and\nwhite right-wing parties solely concerned with obtaining an Afrikaner homeland. Chief Buthelezi called for the abolition of the Record of\nUnderstanding, the ending of CODESA, and the disbanding of Umkhonto we Sizwe.\nJust as Joe Slovo had taken the initiative concerning the suspension of the armed struggle, he again took the lead in making another\ncontroversial proposal: a government of national unity. In October, Joe published a paper in which he wrote that negotiations with the government\nwere not armistice talks in which we could dictate terms to a defeated enemy. It would probably take years for the ANC to control the levers of\ngovernment, even after an election. An ANC government would still require much of the present civil service to run the country. Joe proposed a\n\u201csunset clause\u201d providing for a government of national unity that would include power-sharing with the National Party for a fixed period of time, an\namnesty for security officers, and the honoring of contracts of civil servants. \u201cPower-sharing\u201d was a debased term within the ANC, considered a\ncode-phrase for the government\u2019s quest for a minority veto. But in this context it merely meant that the National Party would be part of any popularly\nelected government provided it polled enough votes.\nAfter much discussion, I supported Joe\u2019s proposal and it was endorsed by the National Executive Committee on November . The NEC agreed\nto support power-sharing, provided the minority parties did not have a veto. In December, we began a new round of secret bilateral talks with the\ngovernment. These were held over a five-day period at a game lodge in the bush. The talks proved to be critical, for they built on the foundation\nestablished in the Record of Understanding. At this bush meeting we agreed in principle on a five-year government of national unity in which all\nparties polling over  percent in a general election would be proportionally represented in the cabinet. After five years, the government of national\nunity would become a simple majority-rule government. In February, the ANC and the government announced an agreement in principle on the fiveyear government of national unity, a multiparty cabinet, and the creation of a transitional executive council. Elections would be held as early as the\nend of . I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED that a man should have a home within sight of the house where he was born. After being released from prison, I set\nabout plans to build a country house for myself in Qunu. By the fall of , the house was complete. It was based on the floor plan of the house I\nlived in at Victor Verster. People often commented on this, but the answer was simple: the Victor Verster house was the first spacious and\ncomfortable home I ever stayed in, and I liked it very much. I was familiar with its dimensions, so at Qunu I would not have to wander in the night\nlooking for the kitchen.\nIn April, I was at my house in the Transkei on a brief holiday. On the morning of April , I had just gone outside to greet some members of the\nTranskei police rugby team when my housekeeper ran out and informed me of an urgent telephone call. She was weeping. I excused myself from\nthe young men and learned from a colleague that Chris Hani, the secretary-general of the SACP, the former chief of staff of MK, and one of the\nmost popular figures in the ANC, had been shot at point-blank range in front of his home in Boksburg, Johannesburg, a mostly white working-class\nsuburb that Chris was seeking to integrate.\nChris\u2019s death was a blow to me personally and to the movement. He was a soldier and patriot, for whom no task was too small. He was a great\nhero among the youth of South Africa; a man who spoke their language and to whom they listened. If anyone could mobilize the unruly youth behind\na negotiated solution, it was Chris. South Africa was now deprived of one of its greatest sons, a man who would have been invaluable in\ntransforming the country into a new nation.\nThe country was fragile. There were concerns that Hani\u2019s death might trigger a racial war, with the youth deciding that their hero should become a\nmartyr for whom they would lay down their own lives. I first flew via helicopter to pay my respects to Chris\u2019s eighty-two-year-old father in Sabalele, a\ntiny, dusty town in the Cofimvaba district in the Transkei, a place well known to me because it was the home region of the Matanzima family. As I\narrived in this village with no running water or electricity, I marveled at how this poor and tiny village could produce a man like Chris Hani, a man\nwho stirred the entire nation with his passion and ability. His concern for the rural poor came from his childhood in Sabalele, for his roots were deep\nand true, and he never lost them. Chris\u2019s father spoke eloquently of the pain of losing a son, but with satisfaction that he had died in the struggle.\nUpon my return to Johannesburg I learned that the police had arrested a member of the militant right-wing Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging\n(AWB), a Polish immigrant to South Africa who had been captured after a courageous Afrikaner woman had phoned the police with the killer\u2019s\nlicense plate number. The murder was an act of mad desperation, an attempt to derail the negotiations process. I was asked to speak on the\nSABC that night to address the nation. In this instance, it was the ANC, not the government, that sought to calm the nation.\nI said that the process of peace and negotiations could not be halted. With all the authority at my command, I said, \u201cI appeal to all our people to\nremain calm and to honor the memory of Chris Hani by remaining a disciplined force for peace.\u201d\nTonight I am reaching out to every single South African, black and white, from the very depths of my being. A white man, full of prejudice and hate, came to our country and\ncommitted a deed so foul that our whole nation now teeters on the brink of disaster. Awhite woman, of Afrikaner origin, risked her life so that we may know, and bring to justice this\nassassin. . . . Now is the time for all South Africans to stand together against those who, from any quarter, wish to destroy what Chris Hani gave his life for \u2014 the freedom of all of\nus.\n\nThe assassination of Chris was an attempt by white supremacists to arrest the inevitable. They preferred that the country descend into civil war\nrather than have majority rule by peaceful means.\nWe adopted a strategy to deal with our own constituency in the ANC. In order to forestall outbreaks of retaliatory violence, we arranged a weeklong series of mass rallies and demonstrations throughout the country. This would give people a means of expressing their frustration without\nresorting to violence. Mr. de Klerk and I spoke privately and agreed that we would not let Hani\u2019s murder derail the negotiations.\nWe learned within days that a member of the Conservative Party, Clive Derby-Lewis, had been arrested in connection with the murder. More\nconfirmation of a Third Force. It was Chris himself who had criticized a recent theft of weapons from an air force base; preliminary police reports\nsuggested that the gun that killed him had come from that stockpile.\n\nExactly two weeks later, there was another significant passing. This one did not shake the nation as Chris\u2019s had, but it shook me. Oliver had not\nbeen well for a long time, but the stroke that killed him occurred suddenly and without warning. His wife, Adelaide, phoned me early in the morning\nand I rushed to Oliver\u2019s bedside. I did not have a chance to say a proper good-bye, for he was already gone.\nIn Plato\u2019s allegory of the metals, the philosopher classifies men into groups of gold, silver, and lead. Oliver was pure gold; there was gold in his\nintellectual brilliance, gold in his warmth and humanity, gold in his tolerance and generosity, gold in his unfailing loyalty and self-sacrifice. As much\nas I respected him as a leader, that is how much I loved him as a man.\nThough we had been apart for all the years that I was in prison, Oliver was never far from my thoughts. In many ways, even though we were\nseparated, I kept up a lifelong conversation with him in my head. Perhaps that is why I felt so bereft when he died. I felt, as I told one colleague, like\nthe loneliest man in the world. It was as though he had been snatched away from me just as we had finally been reunited. When I looked at him in\nhis casket, it was as if a part of myself had died.\nThough we were not yet in power, I wanted Oliver to have a state funeral, and that is what the ANC gave him. At a mass rally at a stadium in\nSoweto, hundreds of dignitaries from foreign governments gathered to pay their respects to the man who kept the ANC alive during its years of\nexile. MK troops marched in his honor and a twenty-one-gun salute was given at his graveside. Oliver had lived to see the prisoners released and\nthe exiles return, but he had not lived to cast his vote in a free and democratic South Africa. That was what remained to be accomplished.\n THE ROAD TO FREEDOM was far from smooth. Although the Transitional Executive Council began functioning in the new year, some parties\nopted out. Inkatha rejected participation in the election and gave itself over to the politics of resistance. King Zwelithini, supported by Chief\nButhelezi, called for an autonomous and sovereign KwaZulu, and discouraged everyone in his province from voting. The white right called the\nelections a betrayal and clamored for a volkstaat, yet they still had not proposed where it would be located or how it would work. There was no\nmagisterial district in all of South Africa where whites constituted a majority of residents.\nFebruary , , was the deadline for registration of all parties, and on that day, Inkatha, the Conservative Party, and the Afrikaner Volksfront\nfailed to sign. The government of the Bophuthatswana homeland also refused to participate and resisted reincorporation into a united South Africa.\nI was disturbed that these important groups were choosing not to participate. To bring them on board, we proposed certain significant\ncompromises: we agreed to the use of double ballots for provincial and national legislatures; guarantees of greater provincial powers; the renaming\nof Natal province as KwaZulu/Natal; and the affirmation that a principle of \u201cinternal\u201d self-determination would be included in the constitution for\ngroups sharing a common cultural and language heritage.\nI arranged to meet Chief Buthelezi in Durban on March . \u201cI will go down on my knees to beg those who want to drag our country into bloodshed,\u201d\nI told a rally before this meeting. Chief Buthelezi agreed to provisionally register for the elections in exchange for a promise to subject our\ndifferences over constitutional issues to international mediation. To this I gladly assented. Before the final registration deadline, General Viljoen\nalso registered under a new party known as the Freedom Front.\nThough Lucas Mangope, the president of Bophuthatswana, had chosen to keep his homeland out of the election, the tide of events soon altered\nthe situation. I spoke to him on a number of occasions urging him to let his people decide, but he would not listen. Those who wanted to participate\nlaunched mass demonstrations and strikes, which soon spread to the Bophuthatswana civil service. The radio and television networks went off the\nair. On the streets of Mafikeng, battles broke out between the homeland police and striking workers and students. Mangope called in military help\nfrom his white right-wing allies. Soon, his own forces deserted him and he was ousted in a coup in early March. A few weeks later, Brigadier Gqozo\nin the Ciskei capitulated and asked South Africa to take over the homeland.\nViolence in Natal worsened. Inkatha supporters were blocking our efforts to campaign in Natal. Fifteen ANC election workers were shot and\nhacked to death after putting up ANC posters. In March, Judge Johann Kriegler reported to me and Mr. de Klerk that because of the lack of\ncooperation from the KwaZulu government, free elections could not be held there without direct political intervention. To demonstrate our strength in\nNatal, the ANC held a mass march through the center of Durban. Then Inkatha attempted to do the same in Johannesburg, with dire results.\nOn March , thousands of Inkatha members, brandishing spears and knobkerries, marched through Johannesburg to a rally in the center of\ntown. At the same time, an armed Inkatha group attempted to enter Shell House, the ANC headquarters, but were repulsed by armed guards. Shots\nby unidentified gunmen were also fired in the city center, and altogether fifty-three people died. It was a grisly spectacle that made South Africa\nappear as if it was on the brink of internal war. Inkatha was attempting to postpone the election, but neither Mr. de Klerk nor I would budge. That day\nwas sacrosanct.\nI had agreed to international mediation, and on April  a delegation arrived led by Lord Carrington, the former British foreign secretary, and\nHenry Kissinger, the former American secretary of state. But when Inkatha was informed that the election date was not subject to mediation, they\nrefused to see the mediators, who left without talking to anyone. Now Chief Buthelezi knew the election would take place no matter what. On April\n, barely a week before the election, Chief Buthelezi accepted the offer of a constitutional role for the Zulu monarchy and agreed to participate.\n\nTen days before the vote, Mr. de Klerk and I held our single television debate. I had been a fair debater at Fort Hare, and in my early years in the\norganization I had engaged in many impassioned debates on the platform. On Robben Island, we had honed our debating skills while we chipped\naway at limestone. I was confident, but the day before, we held a mock debate in which the journalist Allister Sparks ably performed as Mr. de\nKlerk. Too ably, according to my campaign advisers, for they chided me for speaking too slowly and not aggressively enough.\nWhen the time came for the actual debate, however, I attacked the National Party quite firmly. I accused the National Party of fanning race hatred\nbetween Coloureds and Africans in the Cape by distributing an inflammatory comic book that said the ANC\u2019s slogan was \u201cKill a Coloured, kill a\nfarmer.\u201d \u201cThere is no organization in this country as divisive as the new National Party,\u201d I declared. When Mr. de Klerk criticized the ANC\u2019s plan to\nspend billions of dollars on housing and social programs, I scolded him, saying he was alarmed that we would have to devote so many of our\nresources to blacks.\nBut as the debate was nearing an end, I felt I had been too harsh with the man who would be my partner in a government of national unity. In\nsummation, I said, \u201cThe exchanges between Mr. de Klerk and me should not obscure one important fact. I think we are a shining example to the\nentire world of people drawn from different racial groups who have a common loyalty, a common love, to their common country. . . . In spite of\ncriticism of Mr. de Klerk,\u201d I said, and then looked over at him, \u201csir, you are one of those I rely upon. We are going to face the problem of this country\ntogether.\u201d At which point I reached over to take his hand and said, \u201cI am proud to hold your hand for us to go forward.\u201d Mr. de Klerk seemed\nsurprised, but pleased.\n I VOTED ON APRIL , the second of the four days of voting, and I chose to vote in Natal to show the people in that divided province that there was\nno danger in going to the polling stations. I voted at Ohlange High School in Inanda, a green and hilly township just north of Durban, for it was there\nthat John Dube, the first president of the ANC, was buried. This African patriot had helped found the organization in , and casting my vote near\nhis grave site brought history full circle, for the mission he began eighty-two years before was about to be achieved.\nAs I stood over his grave, on a rise above the small school below, I thought not of the present but of the past. When I walked to the voting station,\nmy mind dwelt on the heroes who had fallen so that I might be where I was that day, the men and women who had made the ultimate sacrifice for a\ncause that was now finally succeeding. I thought of Oliver Tambo, and Chris Hani, and Chief Luthuli, and Bram Fischer. I thought of our great African\nheroes, who had sacrificed so that millions of South Africans could be voting on that very day; I thought of Josiah Gumede, G. M. Naicker, Dr.\nAbdullah Abdurahman, Lilian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, Yusuf Dadoo, Moses Kotane. I did not go into that voting station alone on April ; I was casting\nmy vote with all of them.\nBefore I entered the polling station, an irreverent member of the press called out, \u201cMr. Mandela, who are you voting for?\u201d I laughed. \u201cYou know,\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cI have been agonizing over that choice all morning.\u201d I marked an X in the box next to the letters ANC and then slipped my folded ballot paper\ninto a simple wooden box; I had cast the first vote of my life.\n\nThe images of South Africans going to the polls that day are burned in my memory. Great lines of patient people snaking through the dirt roads and\nstreets of towns and cities; old women who had waited half a century to cast their first vote saying that they felt like human beings for the first time in\ntheir lives; white men and women saying they were proud to live in a free country at last. The mood of the nation during those days of voting was\nbuoyant. The violence and bombings ceased, and it was as if we were a nation reborn. Even the logistical difficulties of the voting, misplaced\nballots, pirate voting stations, and rumors of fraud in certain places could not dim the overwhelming victory for democracy and justice.\nIt took several days for the results to be counted. We polled . percent of the national vote, slightly short of the two-thirds needed had we\nwished to push through a final constitution without support from other parties. That percentage qualified us for  of  seats in the national\nassembly. The ANC thoroughly dominated the northern and eastern Transvaal, the northwest, the eastern Cape and the Free State. We won \npercent of the vote in the western Cape, which was won by the National Party, which did extremely well among Coloured voters. We captured \npercent in KwaZulu/Natal, which was won by Inkatha. In Natal, fear of violence and intimidation kept many of our voters at home. There were\ncharges, as well, of vote fraud and vote rigging. But in the end, that did not matter. We had underestimated Inkatha\u2019s strength in KwaZulu, and they\nhad demonstrated it on election day.\nSome in the ANC were disappointed that we did not cross the two-thirds threshold, but I was not one of them. In fact I was relieved; had we won\ntwo-thirds of the vote and been able to write a constitution unfettered by input from others, people would argue that we had created an ANC\nconstitution, not a South African constitution. I wanted a true government of national unity.\n\nOn the evening of May , Mr. de Klerk made a gracious concession speech. After more than three centuries of rule, the white minority was\nconceding defeat and turning over power to the black majority. That evening, the ANC was planning a victory celebration at the ballroom of the\nCarlton Hotel in downtown Johannesburg. I was suffering from a bad case of the flu and my doctors ordered me to remain at home. But there was\nnothing that could keep me away from that party. I went onstage at about nine o\u2019clock and faced a crowd of happy, smiling, cheering faces.\nI explained to the crowd that my voice was hoarse from a cold and that my physician had advised me not to attend. \u201cI hope that you will not\ndisclose to him that I have violated his instructions,\u201d I told them. I congratulated Mr. de Klerk for his strong showing. I thanked all those in the ANC\nand the democratic movement who had worked so hard for so long. Mrs. Coretta Scott King, the wife of the great freedom fighter Martin Luther\nKing Jr., was on the podium that night, and I looked over to her as I made reference to her husband\u2019s immortal words.\nThis is one of the most important moments in the life of our country. I stand here before you filled with deep pride and joy \u2014 pride in the ordinary, humble people of this country. You\nhave shown such a calm, patient determination to reclaim this country as your own, and now the joy that we can loudly proclaim from the rooftops \u2014 Free at last! Free at last! I stand\nbefore you humbled by your courage, with a heart full of love for all of you. I regard it as the highest honor to lead the ANC at this moment in our history. I am your servant. . . . It is not\nthe individuals that matter, but the collective. . . . This is a time to heal the old wounds and build a new South Africa.\n\nFrom the moment the results were in and it was apparent that the ANC was to form the government, I saw my mission as one of preaching\nreconciliation, of binding the wounds of the country, of engendering trust and confidence. I knew that many people, particularly the minorities, whites,\nColoureds, and Indians, would be feeling anxious about the future, and I wanted them to feel secure. I reminded people again and again that the\nliberation struggle was not a battle against any one group or color, but a fight against a system of repression. At every opportunity, I said all South\nAfricans must now unite and join hands and say we are one country, one nation, one people, marching together into the future. MAY  DAWNED bright and clear. For the past few days, I had been pleasantly besieged by arriving dignitaries and world leaders who were\ncoming to pay their respects before the inauguration. The inauguration would be the largest gathering ever of international leaders on South African\nsoil.\nThe ceremonies took place in the lovely sandstone amphitheater formed by the Union Buildings in Pretoria. For decades, this had been the seat\nof white supremacy, and now it was the site of a rainbow gathering of different colors and nations for the installation of South Africa\u2019s first\ndemocratic, nonracial government.\nOn that lovely autumn day I was accompanied by my daughter Zenani. On the podium, Mr. de Klerk was first sworn in as second deputy\npresident. Then Thabo Mbeki was sworn in as first deputy president. When it was my turn, I pledged to obey and uphold the constitution and to\ndevote myself to the well-being of the republic and its people. To the assembled guests and the watching world, I said:\nToday, all of us do, by our presence here . . . confer glory and hope to newborn liberty. Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a\nsociety of which all humanity will be proud.\n. . . We, who were outlaws not so long ago, have today been given the rare privilege to be host to the nations of the world on our own soil. We thank all of our distinguished\ninternational guests for having come to take possession with the people of our country of what is, after all, a common victory for justice, for peace, for human dignity.\nWe have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender, and\nother discrimination.\nNever, never, and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another. . . . The sun shall never set on so glorious a human\nachievement.\nLet freedom reign. God bless Africa!\n\nA few moments later we all lifted our eyes in awe as a spectacular array of South African jets, helicopters, and troop carriers roared in perfect\nformation over the Union Buildings. It was not only a display of pinpoint precision and military force, but a demonstration of the military\u2019s loyalty to\ndemocracy, to a new government that had been freely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the highest generals of the South African Defense\nForce and police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and medals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged their loyalty. I was not unmindful of\nthe fact that not so many years before they would not have saluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala jets left a smoke trail of the black,\nred, green, blue, white, and gold of the new South African flag.\nThe day was symbolized for me by the playing of our two national anthems, and the vision of whites singing \u201cNkosi Sikelel\u2019 iAfrika\u201d and blacks\nsinging \u201cDie Stem,\u201d the old anthem of the republic. Although that day, neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem they once despised, they would\nsoon know the words by heart.\n\nOn the day of the inauguration, I was overwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first decade of the twentieth century, a few years after the bitter\nAnglo-Boer War and before my own birth, the white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched up their differences and erected a system of racial\ndomination against the dark-skinned peoples of their own land. The structure they created formed the basis of one of the harshest, most inhumane\nsocieties the world has ever known. Now, in the last decade of the twentieth century, and my own eighth decade as a man, that system had been\noverturned forever and replaced by one that recognized the rights and freedoms of all peoples regardless of the color of their skin.\nThat day had come about through the unimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people, people whose suffering and courage can never be\ncounted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so many other days, that I was simply the sum of all those African patriots who had gone before me.\nThat long and noble line ended and now began again with me. I was pained that I was not able to thank them and that they were not able to see\nwhat their sacrifices had wrought.\nThe policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting wound in my country and my people. All of us will spend many years, if not generations,\nrecovering from that profound hurt. But the decades of oppression and brutality had another, unintended effect, and that was that it produced the\nOliver Tambos, the Walter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the Yusuf Dadoos, the Bram Fischers, the Robert Sobukwes of our time \u2014 men of such\nextraordinary courage, wisdom, and generosity that their like may never be known again. Perhaps it requires such depth of oppression to create\nsuch heights of character. My country is rich in the minerals and gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always known that its greatest wealth is its\npeople, finer and truer than the purest diamonds.\nIt is from these comrades in the struggle that I learned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I have seen men and women risk and give their\nlives for an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks and torture without breaking, showing a strength and resiliency that defies the imagination. I\nlearned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. I felt fear myself more times than I can remember, but I hid it behind a\nmask of boldness. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.\nI never lost hope that this great transformation would occur. Not only because of the great heroes I have already cited, but because of the courage\nof the ordinary men and women of my country. I always knew that deep down in every human heart, there is mercy and generosity. No one is born\nhating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate,\nthey can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when my\ncomrades and I were pushed to our limits, I would see a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards, perhaps just for a second, but it was enough to\nreassure me and keep me going. Man\u2019s goodness is a flame that can be hidden but never extinguished.\nWe took up the struggle with our eyes wide open, under no illusion that the path would be an easy one. As a young man, when I joined the African\nNational Congress, I saw the price my comrades paid for their beliefs, and it was high. For myself, I have never regretted my commitment to the\nstruggle, and I was always prepared to face the hardships that affected me personally. But my family paid a terrible price, perhaps too dear a price\nfor my commitment.\nIn life, every man has twin obligations \u2014 obligations to his family to his parents, to his wife and children; and he has an obligation to his people,\nhis community, his country. In a civil and humane society, each man is able to fulfill those obligations according to his own inclinations and abilities.\nBut in a country like South Africa, it was almost impossible for a man of my birth and color to fulfill both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man\nof color who attempted to live as a human being was punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who tried to fulfill his duty to his people was\ninevitably ripped from his family and his home and was forced to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy and rebellion. I did not in the\nbeginning choose to place my people above my family, but in attempting to serve my people, I found that I was prevented from fulfilling my\nobligations as a son, a brother, a father, and a husband.\nIn that way, my commitment to my people, to the millions of South Africans I would never know or meet, was at the expense of the people I knew\n\n\fbest and loved most. It was as simple and yet as incomprehensible as the moment a small child asks her father, \u201cWhy can you not be with us?\u201d And\nthe father must utter the terrible words: \u201cThere are other children like you, a great many of them . . .\u201d and then one\u2019s voice trails off.\n\nI was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born free \u2014 free in every way that I could know. Free to run in the fields near my mother\u2019s hut, free to\nswim in the clear stream that ran through my village, free to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as\nI obeyed my father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was not troubled by the laws of man or God.\nIt was only when I began to learn that my boyhood freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a young man that my freedom had already been\ntaken from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the transitory freedoms of being able to stay out\nat night, read what I pleased, and go where I chose. Later, as a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the basic and honorable freedoms of\nachieving my potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and having a family \u2014 the freedom not to be obstructed in a lawful life.\nBut then I slowly saw that not only was I not free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I saw that it was not just my freedom that was curtailed,\nbut the freedom of everyone who looked like I did. That is when I joined the African National Congress, and that is when the hunger for my own\nfreedom became the greater hunger for the freedom of my people. It was this desire for the freedom of my people to live their lives with dignity and\nself-respect that animated my life, that transformed a frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a law-abiding attorney to become a criminal,\nthat turned a family-loving husband into a man without a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a monk. I am no more virtuous or selfsacrificing than the next man, but I found that I could not even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was allowed when I knew my people were not\nfree. Freedom is indivisible; the chains on any one of my people were the chains on all of them, the chains on all of my people were the chains on\nme.\nIt was during those long and lonely years that my hunger for the freedom of my own people became a hunger for the freedom of all people, white\nand black. I knew as well as I knew anything that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away another\nman\u2019s freedom is a prisoner of hatred, he is locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrow-mindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away\nsomeone else\u2019s freedom, just as surely as I am not free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed and the oppressor alike are robbed of\ntheir humanity.\nWhen I walked out of prison, that was my mission, to liberate the oppressed and the oppressor both. Some say that has now been achieved. But\nI know that that is not the case. The truth is that we are not yet free; we have merely achieved the freedom to be free, the right not to be oppressed.\nWe have not taken the final step of our journey, but the first step on a longer and even more difficult road. For to be free is not merely to cast off\none\u2019s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. The true test of our devotion to freedom is just beginning.\nI have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after\nclimbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista\nthat surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not\nlinger, for my long walk is not yet ended."
