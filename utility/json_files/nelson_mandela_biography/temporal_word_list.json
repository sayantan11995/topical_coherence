    "1939-1945": " THE MISSION SCHOOL LADDER\nMANDELA WAS BORN IN THE SIMPLE SURROUNDINGS OF A\nPEASANT village on the banks of the Mbashe river in Thembuland. But for his\nroyal connections, his childhood would have been no different from those of\nmany others there. His great-grandfather Ngubengcuka, however, was a Thembu\nking, renowned for his skill in bringing stability to diverse Thembu clans in the\nearly nineteenth century. And although Mandela was descended from only a\nminor branch of the dynasty\u2014the Left-hand House\u2014his link with the Thembu\nroyal family was to have a marked influence on both his character and his\nfortunes.\nHis father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was the village headman at Mvezo.\nA tall, respected figure, he presided over local ceremonies and officiated at\ntraditional rites for such occasions as births, marriages, funerals, harvests and\ninitiation ceremonies. Like most of his generation, he had had no formal\neducation; he could not read or write. But he had a keen sense of history and was\nvalued as a counsellor to the royal family. He was also wealthy enough at one\ntime to afford four wives and sired in all thirteen children.\nMandela\u2019s mother, Nosekeni Nkedama, was the third of Gadla\u2019s wives. She\nbore four children, the eldest of whom, Mandela, was her only son but the\nyoungest of Gadla\u2019s four sons. Like Gadla, she could neither read nor write.\nWhile Gadla adhered to the traditional Qaba faith, involving the worship of\nancestral spirits, Nosekeni became a devout Christian, taking the name of Fanny.\nThe Xhosa name given to Mandela at his birth on  July  was\nRolihlahla, which meant literally \u2018pulling the branch of a tree\u2019, but more\ncolloquially \u2018troublemaker\u2019, and there were friends and relatives who later\nascribed to his Xhosa name the troubles he would encounter. But the name by\nwhich he became popularly known was an English one, Nelson, given to him by\nan African teacher on the first day he attended school. For that, there was no\nready explanation, only surmise that it was taken from the famous English\n\n\fadmiral.\nIt was shortly after he was born that the Mandela household itself encountered\nserious trouble. Gadla\u2019s position as headman was dependent not only upon tribal\nlineage but upon the approval of white officials in the Cape colonial\nadministration. After its annexation by Britain in , Thembuland had come\nunder the control of colonial magistrates who maintained a system of indirect\nrule through village headmen appointed to keep order among the local\npopulation as well as to represent their interests. The same system remained in\nplace when Thembuland became part of the Union of South Africa, established\nin , eight years before Mandela was born.\nWell known for his stubbornness, Gadla fell into a minor dispute over cattle\nwith the local magistrate and refused to answer a summons to appear before him.\nGadla took the view that the matter was of tribal concern and not part of the\nmagistrate\u2019s jurisdiction. He was dismissed for insubordination, losing not only\nhis government stipend but most of his cattle and his land and the revenue that\nwent with them. Facing penury, he sent Nosekeni and her young son to Qunu, a\nvillage to the north of Mvezo, about twenty miles from the town of Umtata,\nwhere her family could help support her. It was there that Mandela spent his\nboyhood.\nThe landscape around Qunu\u2014undulating hills, clear streams and lush pastures\ngrazed by cattle, sheep and goats\u2014made an indelible impression on Mandela.\nQunu was the place where he felt his real roots lay. It was a settlement of\nbeehive-shaped huts in a narrow valley where life continued much as it had done\nfor generations past. The population there, numbering no more than a few\nhundred, consisted predominantly of \u2018red\u2019 people, who dyed their blankets and\nclothes with red ochre, a colour said to be beloved by ancestral spirits and the\ncolour of their faith. There were few Christians in Qunu and those that were\nthere stood out because of the Western-style clothes they wore.\nThe Mandela homestead, like most others in Qunu, was simple. Their beehive\nhuts\u2014a cluster of three\u2014were built without windows or chimneys. The floors\nwere made of crusted earth taken from ant - hills and kept smooth with layers of\nfresh cow dung. There was no furniture, in the Western sense. Everyone slept on\nmats, without pillows, resting their heads on their arms. Smoke from the fire\nfiltered through the grass roof. There was no opening other than a low doorway.\nTheir diet was also simple, mainly maize, sorghum, beans and pumpkins grown\n\n\fin fields outside the village and amasi, fermented milk stored in calabashes.\nOnly a few wealthy families could afford luxuries like tea, coffee and sugar,\nbought from the local store.\nHaving four wives, each living in her own kraal several miles apart, Gadla\nvisited them in turn, spending perhaps one week a month with each one. With\nhis children, he was a strict disciplinarian. Complete obedience was expected, in\naccordance with Thembu tradition; questions were rarely tolerated. The life that\nMandela led as a child was governed by strict codes of custom and taboo,\nguiding him through each state of adolescence. The number of taboos restricting\nthe course of daily life, for men, boys, girls and especially married women, ran\ninto hundreds. Most were associated with sex, with key passages of life and with\nfood. All were held in superstitious awe. Any transgression could incur the wrath\nof ancestral spirits, which was to be avoided at all costs.\nAlong with tribal discipline came the support of an extended family. The\nMandela household in Qunu was often full of relatives, taking as much interest\nin the Mandela children as in their own. In Thembu tradition, as with many other\nAfrican tribes, uncles and aunts were as responsible for the welfare of children\nas the children\u2019s own parents and were referred to as \u2018little fathers\u2019 and \u2018little\nmothers\u2019. The family circle in which Mandela grew up was thus an affectionate\none. Even though he remembered his father mainly for his stern countenance,\nMandela tried to emulate him by rubbing white ash into his hair in imitation of\nthe tuft of white hair above Gadla\u2019s forehead. Like Gadla, he had the distinctive\nfacial features of the Madiba clan, high cheek-bones and slanting eyes.\nFrom the age of five, Mandela was set to work as a herdboy, looking after\nsheep and calves and learning the central role that cattle played in Thembu\nsociety. Cattle were not only a source of meat and milk but the main medium of\nexchange and the measure of a tribes-man\u2019s wealth. As the price of a bride was\npaid in cattle, without cattle there could be no marriage. Moreover, the principal\nmeans of propitiating ancestral spirits were through the sacrifice of cattle.\nSignificant events like funerals were marked by their slaughter.\nMuch of Mandela\u2019s time was also spent in the open veld in the company of\nmembers of his own age group, stick-throwing and fighting, gathering wild\nhoney and fruits, trapping birds and small animals that could be roasted, and\nswimming in the cold streams\u2014the normal pursuits of young Thembu boys.\nWhat first set him on a different course was the influence of two villagers\n\n\fknown as Mfengu. The Mfengu had arrived in Thembuland and neighbouring\nXhosaland as refugees fleeing southwards from a series of wars and upheavals\ncalled the mfecane which accompanied the rise of the Zulu kingdom in the\ns. Drawn from a number of different clans among the northern Nguni, the\nrefugees, some moving in scattered bands, others in larger groups, were given\nthe name of Mfengu to describe their position as suppliants and were often\ntreated with contempt and animosity. Lacking land and cattle, many formed a\nservant class for the Thembu and their Xhosa neighbours. But they were also\nmore readily adaptable to serving the interests of white colonists. Mfengu levies\nfought as combatants on the colonial side in four frontier wars in the Cape\nColony, helping to inflict defeats on the Xhosa. They were rewarded with land\nand cattle. A large area of what had been Xhosa territory was designated as\nFingoland. They were also among the first to take advantage of Christian\nmissionary education, acquiring new skills and finding employment as teachers,\nclerks, policemen and court officials.\nMandela\u2019s father did not share the common prejudice against Mfengu. Among\nhis friends were two Mfengu brothers, George and Ben Mbekela, both Christian,\none a retired teacher, the other a police sergeant. It was their suggestion that\nMandela should be baptised and sent to the local mission-run school. Gadla,\nrecognising that an education was the only advancement available for his\nyoungest son, accepted the idea.\nAt the age of seven, Mandela went to the one-room school in Qunu, crossing\nthe boundary between \u2018red\u2019 people and \u2018school\u2019 people. To mark the occasion,\nGadla presented him with a pair of his old trousers, cut off at the knee and\nfastened around his waist with a piece of string. Hitherto, the only clothing that\nMandela had worn had been a blanket, wrapped around one shoulder and pinned\nat the waist. \u2018I must have been a comical sight,\u2019 he wrote in his autobiography,\n\u2018but I have never owned a suit I was prouder to wear than my father\u2019s cut-off\ntrousers.\u2019\nTwo years later, in the Mandela household in Qunu, Gadla died, leaving\nNosekeni without the means to continue her son\u2019s education. The event changed\nMandela\u2019s life dramatically. Because of his family ties to the Thembu royal\nhouse and to the Madiba clan dating back to an eighteenth-century Thembu\nchief, the young Mandela was taken up as a ward by Chief Jongintaba\nDalindyebo, the acting regent of the Thembu people. Accompanied by his\nmother, he left the simple idyll of Qunu, walking across the hills westwards to\n\n\fMqheke - zweni, the provisional capital of Thembuland, where Jongintaba\nmaintained his Great Place, and entered a new world.\nThe royal residence, consisting of two large rectangular houses with\ncorrugated-iron roofs surrounded by seven thatched rondavels all washed in\nwhite lime, was more impressive than anything the young Mandela had ever\nseen. As he approached, Jongintaba himself arrived in a Ford V, to be greeted\nby a group of tribal elders who had been waiting in the shade of eucalyptus trees\nwith the traditional salute, \u2018Bayete, Jongintaba!\u2019\u2014\u2018Hail, Jongintaba!\u2019\nIn accordance with tribal custom, Mandela was accepted by Jongintaba into\nthe Great Place as if he were his own child. He shared a rondavel with his only\nson, Justice, wore the same kind of clothes and was subject to the same parental\ndiscipline. The regent\u2019s wife, NoEngland, treated him with equal affection and,\nonce his own mother had returned to Qunu, soon filled her place. Life at\nMqhekezweni was too full of excitement for Mandela to miss for long the world\nhe had loved at Qunu. Even the chores seemed more enjoyable. He took\nparticular pride in ironing the creases in the trousers of Jongintaba\u2019s suits.\nWhat impressed him above all was the influence of the chieftaincy. Under\ncolonial rule, hereditary chiefs had retained a wide range of powers and\nfunctions. They continued to conduct traditional court cases, to collect tributary\nfees and dues, and to exercise considerable authority over the distribution of\nland. They constituted a central part of the colonial administrative system, held\nin high esteem by white officials, while enjoying at the same time the traditional\nsupport of the local population.\nWatching at close quarters the way in which Jongintaba exercised his power\nas regent, Mandela became absorbed by the workings of the chieftaincy. At\ntribal meetings at the Great Place, when high-ranking councillors gathered to\ndiscuss both local and national issues, he observed how Jongintaba would take\ncare to hear all opinions, listening in silence to whatever criticism was made,\neven of himself, before making a summary of what had been said and\nendeavouring to find a consensus of views. It was a style of leadership which\nmade a profound impression upon him. He learned too of the proceedings of the\ntraditional courts at Mqhekezweni, where chiefs and headmen from surrounding\ndistricts met to settle disputes and judge cases.\nIt was from these tribal elders, sitting around the fireside at night, that\nMandela first heard stories of Robben Island. It was mentioned often by them\n\n\fwhen recounting the long history of conflict between white colonists and Xhosaspeaking tribes in the turbulent eastern frontier region of the Cape Colony during\nthe nineteenth century. The name given to it in the Xhosa language was\nEsiqithini, a word which quite simply meant \u2018on the island\u2019. Everybody knew\nwhich island was referred to and what it meant. For the Xhosa, it was a place of\nbanishment and death.\n\nThe first Xhosa leader whom the whites sent to Robben Island was a warriorprophet called Makana; he was also known by the name of Nxele, meaning the\nLeft-handed. In , in retaliation for a raid by colonial troops into Xhosa\nterritory, Makana had led an army of , men against the British military\noutpost at Grahamstown, intending \u2018to chase the white men from the earth and\ndrive them into the sea\u2019. The attack, in broad daylight, failed. Four months later,\nafter British forces had laid waste to a vast stretch of Xhosa territory, Makana\ngave himself up at a military camp, hoping to stop the slaughter. \u2018People say that\nI have occasioned this war,\u2019 he said. \u2018Let me see whether delivering myself up to\nthe conquerors will restore peace to my country.\u2019\nMakana was sentenced to life imprisonment, taken in shackles to Port\nElizabeth, put on board the brig Salisbury and delivered to Robben Island, \nmiles away, off the coast at Cape Town. It had been used since the seventeenth\ncentury as a prison colony for both criminal convicts and political dissidents.\nWithin a year of his imprisonment, Makana, along with other inmates, helped\norganise an escape, seized a fishing boat and headed for the mainland three miles\naway. As the boat came into the breakers off Blauberg beach, it capsized.\nAccording to the survivors, Makana clung for some time to a rock, shouting\nencouragement to others to reach the shore, until he was swept off and engulfed\nby the raging surf.\nMakana was never forgotten by his Xhosa followers. Many refused to believe\nthat he was dead and waited for years for his return, giving rise to a new Xhosa\nexpression, \u2018Kukuzakuka Nxele\u2019, the coming of Nxele, meaning forlorn hope.\nThe fate of Maqoma, the greatest military commander the Xhosa ever\nproduced, was also well remembered. Expelled from his native valley in ,\nMaqoma engaged in a series of wars against the British in an attempt to regain\nlost Xhosa lands. During the s, his guerrilla force based in the Amatola\nmountains held at bay a British army for months on end, inflicting one defeat\n\n\fafter another.\nTwice Maqoma was shipped off to Robben Island. During his first term of\nimprisonment, lasting eleven years, he was allowed the company of his youngest\nwife and a son. But on the second occasion, at the age of seventy-three, he was\nsent back there alone. No one else on the island spoke any Xhosa. He received\nno visitors. According to an Anglican chaplain who witnessed his last moments\nin , he cried bitterly, before dying of old age and dejection, \u2018at being here\nalone\u2014no wife, or child, or attendant\u2019.\nAfter nine frontier wars, Xhosa resistance against British colonial rule finally\nended. Once an expanding and aggressive nation, the Xhosa had lost great\nswathes of land to white settlers. In the process, Xhosa leaders squabbled and\nfought with each other as much as they did with the white colonists. Some chiefs\ndefected to the colonial side. Others were willing enough to collaborate. In the\nmost desperate act of resistance, the Xhosa slaughtered vast herds of their own\ncattle, believing the prophecy of a teenage girl, Nongqawuse, that it would help\n\u2018in driving the English from the land\u2019. It resulted only in mass starvation, in\nwhich tens of thousands of Xhosa died and enabled the authorities to take yet\nmore Xhosa territory for white settlement.\nUnlike their Xhosa neighbours to the south-west, the Thembu, a Xhosaspeaking people, managed to avoid most of the frontier conflict and lost little\nland to white settlement. Yet Thembuland, like all the other independent\nchiefdoms in the area, eventually succumbed to Cape control and became\nincorporated into a new region known as the Transkeian Territories. It was the\nlargest area of South Africa not to fall into white hands. But just as much as the\nXhosa, the Thembu had lost political control. The authority of their chiefs had\nbecome secondary to that of colonial officials, like the magistrates, as Mandela\u2019s\nfather had found to his cost.\nWhat stirred the young Mandela\u2019s imagination, as he listened to these tales of\nXhosa history around the fireside, were the bravery and defiance shown by\nXhosa leaders who stood against the whites\u2019 advance. The age of the chiefs was\nseen as a heroic time. The memory of men like Makana and Maqoma was\ncarried down from one generation to the next to ensure that a tradition of\nresistance survived. They became the heroes of Mandela\u2019s youth.\n\n\fAnother profound influence on Mandela at Mqhekezweni, pulling in a different\ndirection, was the Church. The mission station there, centred around a white\nstucco church, was revered in Mqhekezweni as much as the Great Place itself. It\nwas part of a century of endeavour by Wesleyan Methodist missionaries to carry\nChristianity to the African peoples of the Eastern Cape which had started when\nthe Reverend William Shaw, a pioneer missionary accompanying a party of\nBritish settlers to the Cape frontier region in , decided that a far greater\npotential for mission work lay in Xhosa territory to the east, \u2018a country\nabounding with heathen inhabitants\u2019. Within a few years his chain of mission\nstations had reached  miles into African territory. One of the mission\nstations, Clarkebury, on the banks of the Mgwali river in the heart of\nThembuland, was built on land donated by Mandela\u2019s great-grandfather, King\nNgubengcuka. Anglican, Presbyterian and Moravian missionaries were also\nactive in the Transkei region.\nBefore arriving in Mqhekezweni, Mandela had been to church only on one\noccasion, to be baptised in the Wesleyan chapel in Qunu as a prelude to\nattending school there. At Mqhekezweni, church was taken much more\nseriously. Jongintaba himself was a devout Wesleyan who regularly attended\nchurch each Sunday, together with his wife, NoEngland, and Mandela was\nexpected to do the same. Once when Mandela missed Sunday service, preferring\nto take part in a fight against boys from another village, he was given a hiding by\nthe regent.\nThe church was always full on Sundays, men dressed in suits, women in long\nskirts and high-necked blouses\u2014a style favoured by missionaries at the time.\nThe local minister, Reverend Matyolo, was a popular figure whose fire-andbrimstone sermons, seasoned with a dose of African animism, found a ready\naudience. But what impressed Mandela, even more than the rituals and\nceremony, was the impact of missionary education. The African elite of the time\n\u2014clerks, teachers, interpreters and policemen\u2014were all products of missionary\nschools.\nAt the primary school at Mqhekezweni, a one-room building next to the royal\nresidence, Mandela showed no particular flair, but he was a diligent learner and\nreceived special attention from his teachers, taking homework back every day to\nthe Great Place, where an aunt would check it. The subjects he studied were\nstandard: English, Xhosa, history and geography. They were taught, in the\ntradition that missionaries had long established, with a notable British bias, for\n\n\fthe missionaries believed in the virtues of the British Empire, British culture and\nBritish institutions just as much as they did in the virtues of Christianity.\nThus Mandela grew up a serious boy, respectful of the chieftaincy, the Church\nand British tradition. At the Great Place, his solemn demeanour earned him the\nnickname Tatamkhulu, meaning Grandpa. He spent much time in the company\nof Justice, Jongintaba\u2019s son and heir, a student at Clarkebury mission who was\nfour years older, admiring him for his outgoing nature, his achievements in sport\nand ballroom dancing, and his success with young women, wishing he could be\nas accomplished.\nAt the age of sixteen, Mandela underwent the ritual of circumcision. It was an\nevent not just of passing interest among the Thembu and other Xhosa-speaking\npeoples, but of fundamental significance. The elaborate ceremonies for initiates,\nlasting several weeks, marked their passage to full manhood. Without\ncircumcision, no Thembu male could marry, set up his own home, inherit his\nfather\u2019s wealth or participate in tribal councils. In Thembu tradition, he would\nremain a boy.\nPreparations for the sacred rites of the abakhwetha, the groups of youths\nundergoing circumcision, were made well in advance, involving whole families.\nTo prove that they were ready to accept adult responsibilities, initiates were\nrequired to undergo a number of ordeals which had been prescribed for\ngenerations. The most important was the act of circumcision itself. It was\nperformed by an ingcibi, a surgeon skilled in the use of an assegai blade, who\nsliced off the foreskin with a single, quick motion. No word was spoken; no\nsound came from the circle of parents and relatives looking on. No matter how\nsevere the pain, the initiates were instructed not to betray the slightest emotion,\nnot to moan, clench a fist, or even frown or blink. To do so would be to incur\nshame and ridicule. Without a moment of hesitation, once the cut had been\nmade, their only action was to shout, \u2018Ndiyindoda!\u2019\u2014 \u2018I am a man!\u2019\nAfter the ceremony, the initiates were secluded in a specially constructed\nlodge for weeks on end under the guidance and discipline of an overseer who\ninstructed them on the rules of manhood and ensured that they adhered to strict\nlodge rules and activities. Their bodies and heads were shaved and covered in\nwhite clay until the end of their seclusion. Humbled by the experience of\ninitiation, the abakhwetha were welcomed back into everyday tribal life with\ngifts and songs and feasting.\n\n\fThe occasion of Mandela\u2019s circumcision was more important than usual, for\nthe group of initiates\u2014twenty-six in all\u2014included Justice, a royal son, and the\nceremony was held at a traditional place for circumcision for Thembu kings at\nTyhalarha, on the banks of the Mbashe river. In accordance with Thembu\ntradition, Justice was both preceded and followed by commoners. Waiting in\nline, Mandela heard the first boy call out \u2018Ndiyindoda!\u2019 followed a few seconds\nlater by Justice. Suddenly, the ingcibi was before him. \u2018The pain was so intense\nthat I buried my chin in my chest,\u2019 he wrote in his autobiography.\nMany seconds seemed to pass before I remembered the cry, and then I\nrecovered and called out \u2018Ndiyindoda!\u2019 I looked down and saw a perfect\ncut, clean and round like a ring. But I felt ashamed because the other\nboys seemed much stronger and firmer than I had been; they had called\nout more promptly than I had. I was distressed that I had been disabled,\nhowever briefly, by the pain, and I did my best to hide my agony. A boy\nmay cry; a man conceals his pain.\nOnce the period of seclusion was over and the initiates, now daubed in red\nochre, had been welcomed back to society as men, Mandela\u2019s spirits revived.\nHis gifts included two heifers and four sheep\u2014the first property he had\npossessed. \u2018I remember walking differently on that day, straighter, taller, firmer.\nI was hopeful, and thinking that I might some day have wealth, property and\nstatus.\u2019\nA succession of speeches followed, delivered by fathers and tribal elders,\nlengthy discourses on Xhosa customs, beliefs and etiquette, on the host of\nresponsibilities that initiates now faced and on the standard of behaviour\nexpected of them. The speech that stuck in Mandela\u2019s mind was one by Chief\nMeligqili, a brother of Jongintaba. He began with conventional remarks about\nthe importance of tribal tradition, but then became increasingly outspoken about\nthe plight of the Xhosa under white rule. They were, he said, slaves in their own\ncountry, with no power or control over their own destiny, performing work for\nthe whites to make them prosperous. The talents and abilities of young Xhosa\nmen, like the initiates present, were meanwhile squandered. Without freedom\nand independence, the Xhosa nation would die.\nMandela was irritated by the speech and put it down to the ramblings of an old\nman who did not understand the value of education and the other benefits that\nwhite rule had brought.\n\n\fThe career laid out for Mandela at the age of sixteen seemed assured. His\nguardian, Jongintaba, intended that he should continue his education, climbing\nsteadily up the mission school ladder, until he was fit for service in the Thembu\nroyal household. His destiny, like that of other members of the Left-hand House\nbefore him, was to become a counsellor to the Thembu chieftaincy. Mandela\nreadily accepted such an outcome. He saw himself fulfilling a role at the heart of\nThembu society, upholding the authority of the chieftaincy and maintaining\ntraditions of which he felt immensely proud.\nThe alternative, as it applied to the vast majority of young Thembu men of his\nage, was for him to seek work far beyond the borders of Thembuland, in the\nmines or on the farms of white South Africa. There was a certain glamour\nattached to such journeys. Men returned home after months away in dashing\nattire\u2014flared trousers, sharp-pointed shoes, striped ties, wide-brimmed hats and\ncoloured handkerchiefs\u2014bearing tales of the excitement of city life, of trams,\nmotor cars and electric lights, and bringing with them new possessions like\ngramophones. They spoke of the mines as places of daring and courage where\nmen were able to prove their manhood.\nBut more lay behind the exodus of men from Thembuland and other African\n\u2018reserves\u2019 than tales of adventure. The reserves were becoming overcrowded,\nwithout sufficient grazing land or arable land to support their growing\npopulations. Parts of the Transkeian Territories consistently failed to produce\nenough food to meet local needs. The burden of taxation, like the poll tax, added\nto the spur to men to find wage employment, as it was specifically designed to\ndo. The result in the Transkei, once one of the most prosperous African areas in\nSouth Africa, was that by the s nearly half of all able-bodied men were\nabsent from their homes at any given moment on long spells of contract labour.\nIn villages like Qunu, where Mandela grew up, the population consisted\npredominantly of old men, women and children.\nHowever much Mandela was attracted by stories of adventure and money far\nafield, Jongintaba decided otherwise. Once he had completed his primary\neducation at Mqhekezweni, Mandela was sent to Clarkebury, the mission school\nwhich Justice had previously attended. Jongintaba himself drove him there, in\nhis Ford V, westwards across the Mbashe river, with Mandela wearing his first\npair of boots, given to him to mark the occasion.\n\n\fClarkebury was the most advanced educational institute in Thembuland. It had\nbeen founded in  through the efforts of a Wesleyan minister and with the\nhelp of funds donated by Thembus themselves. It served as both a secondary\nschool and a teacher-training college, as well as providing practical training in\ncarpentry, shoemaking, printing and other trades. It was also the centre of a\nMethodist network of forty-two outstation schools in Thembuland, including the\nprimary schools at Qunu and Mqhekezweni which Mandela had attended. Its\nbuildings were on a far grander scale than anything he had previously\nencountered.\nOn arrival, Jongintaba, himself a former pupil, took Mandela to meet the\nschool principal, the Reverend Cecil Harris. Hitherto, Mandela had had few\ndirect dealings with whites. At Qunu, the only whites to be seen, apart from the\nlocal magistrate and the local store-keeper, were occasional travellers and\npolicemen. At Mqhekezweni, white government officials and traders had often\ncalled at the Great Place to speak to Jongintaba and Mandela had observed them\nfrom a distance. But, as Jongintaba explained while they were on their way to\nClarkebury, the Reverend Harris was different from all of them. A man\nrenowned for his understanding and affection for the Thembu people, he was\nregarded by them as a Thembu himself. One day, said Jongintaba, he would be\nentrusted with the upbringing of the future paramount chief, Sabata Dalindyebo.\nHe was to be treated with as much respect and obedience as the regent himself.\nIn the principal\u2019s office, as he was introduced by Jongintaba, Mandela shook\nHarris\u2019s hand, the first time he had shaken hands with a white man.\nMandela soon discovered that the Reverend Harris ruled Clarkebury with an\niron rod. His countenance was invariably severe. Punishment was handed out\nswiftly to anyone who transgressed the rules. Students went in fear of him and\nthe staff, both white and black, tended to adopt a servile manner.\nIn private, however, Mandela came to see a different figure. Because\nJongintaba had asked the principal to take a special interest in Mandela, in view\nof his likely destiny as a royal counsellor, the Reverend Harris had arranged for\nhim to work in his garden after school hours, instead of participating with other\npupils in manual labour elsewhere. There Mandela observed a more gentle man,\noften lost in thought, taciturn but broad-minded and devoted to the cause of\neducating young Africans. His wife too made a favourable impression, carrying\nout to the garden warm scones and passing the time in conversation. The Harris\nfamily were the first white family with whom Mandela became familiar.\n\n\fAt the age of nineteen, Mandela moved up the mission school ladder to\nHealdtown, a Wesleyan foundation sited at the head of a large and fertile valley\nsix miles from the village of Fort Beaufort in Ciskei, an area where many of the\nfrontier wars had been fought. It had been established in , originally for the\neducation of Mfengu as a reward for their loyal service to the British cause, but\nhad since grown into the largest educational establishment for Africans in South\nAfrica, providing a wide range of schooling for boys and girls, from primary\neducation to the end-of-school matriculation examination. Its Christian and\nliberal arts education founded on English grammar and literature had profoundly\ninfluenced generations of students. Most of the staff came from Britain and the\nEnglish model provided the basis for all teaching. The principal, Dr Arthur\nWellington, was a man who liked to boast to pupils of his connection to the\nDuke of Wellington, the British general who defeated Napoleon at the battle of\nWaterloo. Mandela recalled, \u2018We were taught and believed that the best ideas\nwere English ideas, the best government was English government and the best\nmen were Englishmen.\u2019\nHealdtown was also renowned for its spartan routines, attributable in part to a\nshortage of mission funds. Breakfast in the dining hall, overlooked by portraits\nof George VI and former Healdtown teachers, consisted of a mug of lukewarm\nwater with sugar and a piece of dry bread; anyone who wanted butter had to buy\nit. Lunch on three days of the week consisted of meat, beans and samp-porridge\nmade from coarsely ground maize; on other days, there was no meat. Supper was\nthe same as breakfast.\nWednesday afternoons were set aside for sport. Friday afternoons were free.\nSaturdays were spent in competitive sports against other schools. They were also\nthe one day of the week when pupils were given permission to walk to Fort\nBeaufort, a village which boasted a general grocer\u2019s store and a fish and chip\nshop. On Saturday nights, once a month, there was a film show and,\noccasionally, a concert given by a local music troupe. On Sundays, boys\nattended church in their full uniform: grey trousers, white shirts, red-and-yellowstriped ties and blazers with a badge on the pocket and the Latin motto Alis velut\naquilarum surgent\u2014they soar as if with the wings of eagles.\nThere were more than , pupils at Healdtown. They mostly came from\nXhosa-speaking districts and, after school hours and at weekends, tended to keep\nto groups from their own home areas. But some came from further afield in\nSouth Africa, as well as from the British protectorates of Basutoland,\n\n\fBechuanaland and Swaziland. To Mandela, they were mostly strangers. His\nsense of identity in belonging to the Thembu tribe broadened to include the\nXhosa people in general but not yet a wider African community. He felt quite\nbold at having as a friend a Sotho-speaking African and was amazed to discover\na Sotho-speaking teacher there who was married to a Xhosa woman. He had\nnever known of anyone marrying outside his tribe before.\nMandela adapted well to life at Healdtown. He much admired his\nhousemaster, the Reverend Seth Mokitimi, took up long-distance running and\nboxing, became a prefect and in due course passed matriculation, enabling him\nto climb to the top of the mission school ladder, the South African Native\nCollege at Fort Hare.\nBefore he left, the Xhosa writer and poet Samuel Mqhayi paid a visit to\nHealdtown. Mqhayi was renowned for his performances as a mbongi, a praisesinger and orator in the flowery court tradition of the Xhosa people. He was\noften at odds with the educational establishment. He had once taught at Lovedale\nmission school, but left teaching because he opposed the way African history\nwas presented. His own writing was a major source of inspiration to early\nAfrican nationalists. In  he had written seven stanzas for the song \u2018Nkosi\nSikelel\u2019 iAfrika\u2019\u2014\u2018God Bless Africa\u2019, a song composed by the Xhosa teacher\nEnoch Sontonga in Johannesburg\u2019s Nancefield location in  which African\nnationalists had decided to use as their anthem.\nGathered in the dining hall, the entire school watched as Mqhayi, dressed in a\nleopard-skin kaross and hat and carrying a spear in each hand, walked on to the\nstage from a side door, followed by Dr Wellington. For Mandela, it was an\nelectrifying moment. He listened enthralled as Mqhayi declaimed against the\ncurse of foreign culture, predicting how the forces of African society would\neventually overcome it. And when he ended with a well-known praise-poem\nabout the Xhosa people, his school audience rose to their feet clapping and\ncheering. It was an event, said Mandela, which for him was \u2018like a comet\nstreaking across the night sky\u2019.\n\nFort Hare was an educational institute for Africans of unique importance. To\nreach there, as Mandela did in  at the age of twenty, represented a great\nachievement. To obtain a degree from there, so few were the number of\ngraduates each year, ensured personal fortune and advancement in any career\n\n\fthen open to Africans. No other place in South Africa offered such opportunity.\nLike most of the African education system, its origins lay largely in\nmissionary endeavour. Three missionary churches\u2014Anglican, Methodist and\nPresbyterian\u2014had combined their efforts to establish a centre for higher\neducation where none previously existed. The site they chose, on mission lands\nbelonging to the United Free Church of Scotland, lay within and adjacent to the\nramparts of Fort Hare, the largest of all the border forts, built in  and named\nafter a British officer. It stood on a small plateau overlooking the Tyumie River,\nhalf a mile from the village of Alice and near to Lovedale mission. Only one of\nthe old fort\u2019s buildings, a square blockhouse, was still standing, but the lines and\ntrenches, once manned by British soldiers, were still clearly visible.\nThere was no imposing building in which the college could start, only a\ncollection of rudimentary bungalows, one of which was adapted for use as a\nhostel, another as a classroom and a third as a house for the principal. The\nsanitation was primitive, there was no gas or electricity, and water for bathing\nhad to be drawn from the Tyumie River. At the opening ceremony, in February\n, the platform for dignitaries was erected under an awning of railway wagon\ncovers on what had once been a parade ground for British troops.\nThere was also a shortage of African students qualified to enter higher\neducation. Only one school in South Africa at the time, Lovedale mission,\nprovided secondary education for Africans. Of the first intake of students at Fort\nHare in , sixteen had to undertake a four-year course in order to pass\nmatriculation. The initial task at Fort Hare, in fact, was to ensure that African\nstudents could reach the minimum standard required for university entrance. The\nfirst graduation ceremony was not held until .\nThe eventual success of Fort Hare was due in large part to the efforts of the\ntwo original members of staff, both of whom were still active when Mandela\narrived in . One was a Scot, Alexander Kerr, educated at Edinburgh\nUniversity and appointed principal at Fort Hare at the age of thirty. Free of the\nracial attitudes common to most whites in South Africa, he was devoted to the\ncause of African education, taught English with a rare passion and maintained\nfirm discipline. The other was an African teacher of legendary talent, Dr\nDavidson Jabavu. The son of a well-known Mfengu teacher, he had been refused\nadmission as a day scholar to a high school for white boys in King William\u2019s\nTown, so he was sent instead to Wales to complete his secondary education. He\n\n\fhad studied at the University of London, graduating with honours in English,\nobtained a diploma in education from the University of Birmingham, then visited\nNegro schools in the United States before returning to take up a post at Fort Hare\nat the age of thirty. He spoke Xhosa, Zulu and Sotho; played the piano and the\nviolin competently; trained and conducted the college choir; and taught Latin,\nBantu studies and history with the same enthusiasm and verve he gave to music.\nHe also was active in Church affairs, in journalism, in politics and in founding\nan agricultural society. At graduation ceremonies at Fort Hare, Jabavu was a\nfavourite subject for the praise-poems of the mbongi, Samuel Mqhayi.\nUnder the guidance of these two teachers, Fort Hare expanded year by year.\nThe first permanent buildings were finished in . New hostels were built,\neach accommodating students according to their Church denomination. The\nMethodist hostel, Wesley House, was completed in . No account was taken\nof tribal affiliations and women were admitted on equal terms. One of the first\ntwo graduates in \u2014the first Africans with a South African university degree\n\u2014was Z. K. Matthews, who went on to study at Yale University before returning\nto Fort Hare in  as a lecturer in anthropology and native law. By , the\nyear before Mandela arrived, the number of graduates had risen to seventeen and\nthe number of students to . No longer was Fort Hare needed for matriculation\npurposes, as secondary schools like Healdtown were by then able to provide a\nsufficient number of qualified entrants.\nMandela arrived, a tall, thin figure, proudly sporting his first suit, a doublebreasted grey outfit given to him by Jongintaba to mark the occasion. He was\nassigned a place in Wesley House in a wooden-floored dormitory of sixteen beds\nwith lockers and cupboards, along with other first-year students. Also resident at\nWesley House, in his third year there, was a distant cousin, Kaizer Matanzima.\nLike Mandela, Matanzima was a descendant of King Ngubengcuka, but he came\nfrom the Great House and was destined to become chief of the Emigrant\nThembu, part of the tribe that had split away in the nineteenth century. They\nbecame close friends. Matanzima took an avuncular interest in Mandela,\nintroduced him to soccer and shared his allowance with him. They attended\nchurch services at nearby Lovedale mission together. Mandela admired\nMatanzima, looking up to him as he had to Justice. He introduced Matanzima to\nhis great wife and stood as best man at their wedding in . But they were\nlater to become political adversaries.\nMandela adapted to the routine at Fort Hare without difficulty. In his first year\n\n\fhe studied English, anthropology, politics, native administration and Roman\nDutch law. In his second year he opted to take an interpreter\u2019s course, thinking\nthat he might settle for a career as an interpreter in a magistrate\u2019s court or some\nother government office\u2014positions of considerable importance for Africans. He\njoined the Dramatic Society, took part in soccer and cross-country running\ncompetitions and spent hours honing his skills as a ballroom dancer to the tunes\nof Victor Sylvester on a crackly old phonograph. His personal habits changed.\nHe wore pajamas for the first time, used toothpaste instead of ash to clean his\nteeth and a toothbrush instead of a toothpick, and used toilet soap instead of blue\ndetergent to wash.\nHe also joined the Student Christian Association. The tradition at Fort Hare\nwas for students to set out on foot in groups on Sunday mornings to conduct\nservices and Sunday schools in nearby villages, in accordance with a longestablished practice inherited from the missionary institutions in which they had\nbeen educated. In addition to religious talks and teaching, the students would\nhold discussions on more mundane matters such as village sanitation and the\nprevention of disease.\nOn such occasions Mandela was often accompanied by a serious-minded\nstudent named Oliver Tambo. Tambo came from humble origins from the village\nof Bizana in Pondoland, north-east of Thembuland. The tribal scarification\nmarks on his cheeks were to remain throughout his life. His parents were poor,\nilliterate peasants but he had been rescued from village life by Anglican\nmissionaries. At Holy Cross mission in Pondoland, he had been so impressed by\nthe workings of the church that he resolved to become a priest himself. \u2018I arrived\nthere on Easter day, and I shall never forget that moment,\u2019 he once told an\nAnglican priest, Father Trevor Huddleston. \u2018We entered the great church while\nthe Mass of Easter was being sung. I can still see the red cassocks of the servers,\nthe grey smoke of the incense, the vestments of the priest at the altar.\u2019 Having\nreached the mission\u2019s highest class, he was sent to an Anglican school in\nJohannesburg, St Peter\u2019s, the first school in the Transvaal at which Africans\ncould take matriculation, and from there gained a scholarship to Fort Hare. A\nresident of the Anglican hostel, Beda Hall, he saw little of Mandela at the time,\nbut the enduring friendship they eventually forged was to become a central part\nof Mandela\u2019s life.\nRemote as Fort Hare was from the outside world, it was nevertheless touched\nby the gathering momentum towards world war. From the warden of Wesley\n\n\fHouse, students heard of each development abroad and gathered round an old\nradio to listen to patriotic speeches. When General Smuts, the deputy prime\nminister, called in at Fort Hare while campaigning for South African support for\nthe British war effort, Mandela cheered him to the hilt.\nHis own fortunes, however, were soon to suffer a serious setback. An abiding\ngrievance among students at Fort Hare was the monotony of the food. It was an\nissue which constantly preoccupied the Student Representative Council. The low\nfees charged at Fort Hare, to ensure that students from poor backgrounds could\ngain access, meant that there was little room for variation in diet. Towards the\nend of Mandela\u2019s second year, complaints about food reached one of their\nperiodic boiling points. A meeting of students unanimously demanded an\nincrease in the powers of the Student Representative Council to enable it to deal\nwith their grievances. A majority voted to boycott elections due to be held for\nthe six members of the council unless their demands were met. Mandela,\nnominated to stand as a candidate for one of the six seats, voted in favour of the\nmove. The election was duly boycotted by a majority of students, but a minority\nof twenty-five went ahead and elected six members, one of whom was Mandela.\nThe six then decided to resign on the grounds that they did not enjoy majority\nsupport and sent a letter of resignation to the principal, Dr Kerr.\nDr Kerr accepted the resignations, then arranged for new elections to be held\nthe next day in the dining hall at supper time, when the entire student body\nwould be present. At these new elections the same twenty-five voters supported\nthe same six candidates, but this time Mandela\u2019s five colleagues accepted the\nresult. Mandela alone held out, deciding to resign once more. He was summoned\nby Dr Kerr, who, after calmly reviewing the matter, asked Mandela to reconsider\nhis decision, pointing out that he could not allow students to act irresponsibly\nand warning that if Mandela insisted on resigning he would be expelled from\nFort Hare.\nWhen set against the opportunities that awaited Mandela and the expectations\nof his family and his guardian, Jongintaba, who had paid for his education and\nprovided him with a home for twelve years, the issue was an utterly trivial one.\nMandela well knew that a degree from Fort Hare was a passport to success.\nTime and again, his teachers\u2014Kerr, Jabavu and Matthews\u2014had stressed the life\nof privilege and prestige to which graduates could look forward. Mandela\nhimself had dreamed of how he would be able to care properly for his mother\nand sisters, restoring the family fortunes that had been lost upon his father\u2019s\n\n\fdismissal as village headman.\nWhat overcame him was a fit of stubbornness of the kind for which his father\nhad been renowned. When he appeared before Dr Kerr the next morning, he was\nstill largely in a state of indecision, but, confronted with the need to decide, he\ndeclared that in good conscience he could not serve on the Student\nRepresentative Council. After a moment\u2019s thought, Dr Kerr replied that he\nwould allow Mandela to return to Fort Hare for a third year, provided that he\njoined the Student Representative Council. In the meantime, he would have the\nsummer holiday to consider the matter.\nMandela returned to Mqhekezweni to face the wrath of Jongintaba. Jongintaba\nbrooked no argument about Mandela\u2019s behaviour, which he regarded as\nsenseless, and ordered him to obey Dr Kerr\u2019s instructions and to return to Fort\nHare after the summer holiday to complete his third year.\nIn all likelihood, Mandela would have returned to Fort Hare, but for an\nunexpected development. In accordance with Thembu tradition, Jongintaba, in\nhis old age, had begun negotiations to arrange a marriage for both his son,\nJustice, and his ward, Mandela, without informing either of them, to settle the\nmatter before his death. A few weeks after Mandela\u2019s return to Mqhekezweni,\nJongintaba summoned them both and told them not only who their brides were\nto be but that the marriages would take place immediately.\nMandela had had a number of love affairs. He enjoyed the company of women\nand felt able to relax with them in a way he was unable to do with men; with\nwomen, he could admit his weaknesses. He was not short of admirers, being a\nhandsome man, powerfully built, with an engaging laugh, a radiant smile and\ndark piercing eyes. He was also by nature a romantic, whose education had\ndistanced him from the notion that an arranged marriage was an acceptable fate.\nThe bride whom Jongintaba had chosen for him came from a respectable family;\nher father was the local Thembu priest. Mandela had also known for many years\nthat Jongintaba might exercise his traditional prerogative to arrange a marriage\nfor him, but the reality of it was more than he could face. He briefly tried to\nenlist the support of the regent\u2019s wife, NoEngland, but Jongintaba remained\nunmoved. The idea of seeking a solution through tribal intermediaries, as custom\nallowed, he did not pursue.\nJustice was no more enamoured of the prospect than Mandela and together\nthey decided to run away. Justice, always more of a playboy than a serious\n\n\fstudent, had struggled to complete his secondary education at Healdtown for\nseveral years. He had recently returned from Cape Town and, with Jongintaba\u2019s\nconsent, had made plans to take up employment as a clerk at a gold mine outside\nJohannesburg. Johannesburg seemed the obvious destination for both of them.\nFirst, they waited for Jongintaba to depart for a scheduled week-long visit to\nthe Transkei capital, Umtata. Then, needing money for the journey, they\ndeceived a local trader into paying them for two of Jongintaba\u2019s prize oxen,\nimplying that they were selling them on his behalf. They then hired a car to take\nthem to the local station, only to find that Jongintaba, suspecting their escapade,\nhad been there before them and instructed the station manager to refuse to sell\nthem tickets should they appear. Considerably shaken by this, they drove off in\nthe hired car to the next station. After taking the train to Queenstown, they\ndisembarked, hoping to be able to arrange travel permits for Johannesburg,\nwithout which they risked arrest. By chance, at the house of a relative with\nwhom they stayed, they met Chief Mpondombini, a brother of Jongintaba.\nClaiming that they were on an errand for the regent, they explained their need of\ntravel documents from the local magistrate. Having no reason to doubt their\nstory, Mpondombini agreed to help and accompanied them to the magistrate\u2019s\noffice. After listening to the chief \u2019s explanation, the magistrate issued the\nnecessary permits. But before handing them over, he decided to check first on\nthe telephone with the chief magistrate in Umtata. By a remarkable coincidence,\nJongintaba happened to be visiting the chief magistrate when the call came\nthrough. When told what was happening, he shouted out in anger, \u2018Arrest those\nboys!\u2019 loud enough for Mandela to hear. Mandela managed to stave off arrest,\nbut left the magistrate\u2019s office in humiliation and disgrace, without the travel\npermits. Some time afterwards, he and Justice succeeded in arranging a lift to\nJohannesburg in a car driven by an elderly white woman visiting relatives there,\nbut for a sum which took virtually all their remaining money.\nMandela\u2019s fall from grace had been swift. One minute he was part of an\nAfrican elite, attending the most advanced educational institute for Africans in\nSouth Africa, assured of prosperity and prestige in whatever field of work he\nchose and welcomed at home in the ruling circles of the Thembu people. A few\nweeks later he had fallen foul of the authorities at Fort Hare over a triviality,\nforsaken the patronage and goodwill of his guardian, Jongintaba, his benefactor\nfor twelve years, and laid a trail of deceit and lies in an escapade arranged in\nhaste and with wanton impatience. Now he was bound, virtually penniless, for a\n\n\fcity renowned for its harsh and violent character, without the slightest idea of\nwhat lay ahead. JOHANNESBURG\nJOHANNESBURG WAS KNOWN IN THE VERNACULAR AS EGOLI\u2014\nTHE city of gold. It stood in the centre of the richest goldfield ever discovered, a\nreef stretching for some forty miles along the line of a rocky ridge named by\nAfrikaner farmers as the Witwatersrand, the Ridge of White Waters, after the\nglistening streams that flowed from it. The gold rush there, starting in , had\nbrought hordes of white foreigners to Paul Kruger\u2019s ramshackle Transvaal\nrepublic and transformed a barren stretch of highveld, , feet above sea level,\ninto a landscape of mining headgear, battery stamps and ore dumps. From the\noriginal tented diggers\u2019 camp there had grown a frontier town of corrugated-iron\nbuildings and boarding houses, renowned for drunkenness, debauchery and\ngambling. \u2018Monte Carlo superimposed on Sodom and Gomorrah\u2019 was one\nvisitor\u2019s verdict. A survey in  counted ninety-seven brothels of various\nnationalities, including thirty-six French, twenty German and five Russian; the\nbrothels in one part of the town were so numerous that it became known as\n\u2018Frenchfontein\u2019.\nBy , after only a decade\u2019s existence, Johannesburg\u2019s population had\nreached ,. Railways had arrived from the Cape, from Durban and from\nDelagoa Bay (Maputo). More substantial buildings had appeared: a stock\nexchange, banks and mining houses. At the newly built Rand Club, the white\nelite\u2014bankers, financiers, lawyers, engineers and businessmen\u2014gathered to\ngrumble and plot against Kruger\u2019s republic, for gold had made the Transvaal the\nrichest state in southern Africa. By  more than a quarter of the world\u2019s\noutput of gold came from the Witwatersrand.\nAll this was too glittering a prize for Britain, then at the peak of its imperial\nambitions, to ignore. An attempted coup d\u2019\u00eatat, known as the Jameson Raid,\nengineered by mining magnates with the connivance of British ministers, failed\nignominiously. But, still determined to extend the realms of empire, Britain\nprovoked a war with Kruger\u2019s republic in , expecting it to be over within a\nfew months. Much of Johannesburg\u2019s population\u2014the immigrant miners,\n\n\fshopkeepers, prostitutes and pimps\u2014fled to the Cape Colony and Natal to await\nthe end; most of the mines closed down. But it was eight months before the\nBritish army managed to reach Johannesburg and another two years before the\nwar was finally over.\nIn the postwar era, Johannesburg acquired a more settled appearance, though\nits reputation remained much the same. \u2018It is a city of unbridled squander and\nunfathomable squalor,\u2019 wrote the Australian journalist Ambrose Pratt in .\nIts population by then had risen to more than a quarter of a million, and its\nboundaries extended to eighty-two square miles. Wealthy whites lived over the\ncrest of the ridge in grand mansions in Parktown, with views stretching away to\nthe Magaliesburg Mountains to the north, protected from the noise and dust of\nthe mine workings and ore dumps by northerly winds which blew it all\nsouthwards. The middle classes went north and east, to suburbs like Hillbrow,\nYeoville and Bellevue.\nWorking-class suburbs sprang up in Jeppe, Troyeville and Belgravia in the\neast and Fordsburg to the west. And a location for the poorest whites, mainly\nunskilled Afrikaners driven out of the Transvaal countryside by poverty and war,\nwas specially established in Vrededorp to the west. The city centre itself\ncontinued to prosper and expand. At its core was the financial district,\nMarshallstown, where the City Hall, the Stock Exchange and the Rand Club\nstood within a few blocks of each other. Johannesburg, above all, was a city of\nmoney. But its origins as a mining camp were never far away. The din of stamp\nbatteries crushing gold ore persisted throughout the night in the city centre and\non windy days clouds of yellow dust from nearby ore dumps swirled through the\nstreets.\nThe African population survived in this milieu as best it could. African\nmineworkers were confined to mine compounds, living in primitive barracks,\nsleeping on narrow concrete shelves, cut off from family and social life on\naverage for periods of nine to twelve months before returning to their homes at\nthe end of their contracts. Thousands of migrant mineworkers passed through the\nrailway station in Johannesburg each week but were otherwise seldom seen\nthere. The resident African population mainly dwelt in squalid and overcrowded\nquarters scattered around the town. Johannesburg\u2019s municipality made little\neffort to provide adequate housing, even for its own employees. Many\n\u2018locations\u2019 like Sophiatown, Martindale and Newclare to the west and Klipspruit\nten miles to the south-west were built adjacent to municipal sewage-depositing\n\n\fsites. Klipspruit, Johannesburg\u2019s first \u2018Native location\u2019, was the worst. By ,\nit was virtually surrounded by a sewage farm; the mortality rate was appalling.\nClose by lay Pimville, established in  originally as an emergency camp for\nrefugees evacuated from a city slum after an outbreak of bubonic plague. Most\nof its buildings had been condemned time and again but were left to stand\nbecause of the lack of alternative housing. Part of Pimville consisted of ninetynine water tanks sliced lengthways down the middle. In , Pimville\npossessed sixty-three water taps to serve an estimated , people. Closer to\nthe centre, scattered throughout the western, central and eastern districts of\nJohannesburg, a network of \u2018slumyards\u2019 proliferated, properties controlled by\nwhite landlords who crammed as many tenants as possible into shanties and\nsingle rooms at exorbitant rents. Slumyard life revolved around the illicit liquor\ntrade and the \u2018incessant relentless war\u2019 that police fought to suppress it.\nIn the mid-s, in an attempt to make urban segregation more effective,\nJohannesburg\u2019s municipality destroyed many of these slumyards, moving the\npopulation to a new location twelve miles to the south-west, in the vicinity of\nKlipspruit. It was named Orlando, after the chairman of the municipal Native\nAffairs Committee at that time, Councillor Edwin Orlando Leake. By ,\nnearly , houses had been built there. Orlando was the prototype for modernday Soweto: monotonous rows of identical houses stretching across the barren\nhighveld, with few facilities provided other than municipal beer halls. The\nadvantage for the authorities was that it was relatively easy to regulate and\nadminister.\nTo avoid municipal controls, many Africans preferred to live in the freehold\nareas of Sophiatown, four miles west of the city centre, and Alexandra, nine\nmiles to the north, lying just outside the municipal boundary, where blacks had\nbeen allowed to buy and own land since the early years of the century. Both\nwere densely populated, full of dilapidated buildings, disease-ridden, rife with\ncrime, violence and prostitution, but home for an ever-increasing black\ncommunity. By , Johannesburg\u2019s total African population had risen to a\nquarter of a million.\nThe official government attitude towards South Africa\u2019s black urban\npopulation was based on the Stallard commission of inquiry into local\ngovernment in the Transvaal, published in , which asserted that \u2018natives\u2014\nmen, women and children\u2014should only be permitted within municipal areas in\nso far and for so long as their presence is demanded by the wants of the white\n\n\fpopulation\u2019 and \u2018should depart there from when they cease to minister to the\nneeds of the white man\u2019. The towns were regarded essentially as white\npreserves; Afri - cans living there were treated as \u2018temporary sojourners\u2019, a\nconvenient reservoir of labour for use when required, but whose real homes were\nin rural reserves. Hence there was no need for the authorities to make anything\nmore than the minimum provision for them. To ensure this policy worked, a\nsystem of pass laws was employed. African men were required to carry passes\nrecording permission to work and live in an urban area. They needed passes for\ntravel, for taxes, for curfews, and these were frequently demanded for inspection\nby police. Mass police raids in the locations were regularly organised to ensure\nthat the pass laws and liquor regulations were being enforced, and, as a police\ncommission of inquiry noted in , the methods used were often violent.\nFor the hundreds of new arrivals who reached Johannesburg each week,\nmainly peasants trying to escape poverty in the reserves and drawn by the\nprospect of jobs, the city was a bewildering and hostile place. The tall buildings,\nthe noise, the traffic, the crowds, the bustle were but a beginning. Everywhere\nwere signs proclaiming \u2018For Europeans Only\u2019, \u2018Slegs vir Blankes\u2019. For Africans,\nthere were no caf\u00e9s, restaurants or hotels which they could use; public transport\nwas segregated. Life became an immediate struggle to secure a room, to acquire\nthe right passes, to find a job. Because of industrial colour-bar legislation,\nAfricans were confined largely to unskilled, manual work; no skilled work was\navailable. But only a small percentage of new arrivals could read or write or\npossessed a trade. What work they could find was invariably low-paid, with long\nhours and poor conditions. Whites they encountered were often abusive. And on\nthe streets, there was the ever-present danger of tsotsis, young gangsters armed\nwith flick knives and sharpened bicycle spokes who left scores of victims\nmaimed and paralysed each week.\nYet the stream of new arrivals grew ever greater. Egoli was the city of gold, of\nmoney, of opportunity. \u2018All roads lead to Johannesburg,\u2019 wrote Alan Paton in his\nnovel Cry, the Beloved Country: \u2018If you are white or if you are black they lead to\nJohannesburg. If the crops fail, there is work in Johannesburg. If there are taxes\nto be paid, there is work in Johannesburg. If the farm is too small to be divided\nfurther, some must go to Johannesburg. If there is a child to be born that must be\ndelivered in secret, it can be delivered in Johannesburg.\u2019 So in their thousands\nthey came\u2014Zulus, Swazis, Shangaans, Xhosas, Sothos, Pedis, Pondos and\nThembus. And among them, seeking his own fortune, was Nelson Mandela.\n\n\fMandela\u2019s introduction to Johannesburg in  was a sobering experience.\nTogether with Justice, he made his way south-west of the city through huge mine\ndumps to the bleak and pockmarked site of Crown Mines. Deafened by the\nrelentless din of mine machinery, they passed lines of African miners tired and\ndirty from their shifts underground. Justice was expected there: a letter from the\nregent requesting employment for him as a clerk had arrived some months\nbeforehand. As the son of a Thembu leader, he was accorded special treatment\nby the mine managers and greeted with gifts on his arrival from Thembu miners.\nHe was also able to persuade the headman, Piliso, to give Mandela a job as a\nmine policeman, assuring him that another letter from the regent requesting his\nemployment would soon arrive. Out of courtesy to the regent, Piliso invited them\nboth to stay initially with him. Mandela duly started work as a night watchman,\narmed with a whistle and a knobkerrie, a heavy stick with a knobbed head,\nguarding the entrance to the mine compound.\nIt was not long before the regent learned of their whereabouts and sent a\ntelegram with the instruction: \u2018Send the boys home.\u2019 Piliso, realising that he had\nbeen duped, confronted them angrily and told them arrangements would be made\nfor their journey back to the Transkei. Determined not to return, they continued\nto use the regent\u2019s name, gaining an introduction to a white mining official who\nissued them with a letter authorising their employment as clerks at Crown\nMines. When Piliso discovered what had happened, he threw them out.\nMandela was without a job, had nowhere to stay and had little money. Worse\nwas to follow. In his suitcase he was carrying an old revolver given to him by his\nfather which he had brought to Johannesburg for protection against gangsters. As\nhe was leaving Crown Mines, his suitcase was searched by a watchman and the\ngun was found. At a nearby police station, Mandela was charged with possession\nof the gun and was told to appear in court, but he was not arrested. In court he\nwas given a nominal fine.\nFrom that low ebb, Mandela\u2019s fortunes began to change. He found lodgings\nwith a cousin, Garlick Mbekeni, in a house in George Goch township, a few\nmiles east of the city centre, and confided to him his ambition to train as a\nlawyer. After making inquiries, Mbekeni took him to see \u2018one of our best people\nin Johannesburg\u2019. It was a meeting that was to have the most profound effect on\nMandela\u2019s life.\n\n\fWalter Sisulu was a man to whom many Africans in Johannesburg turned for\nhelp. Only six years older than Mandela, also originally from the Transkei, he\nhad established a reputation as a community leader always ready to take on other\npeople\u2019s problems. His office in seedy premises near Market Street on the\nwestern edge of the city centre, from where he ran an estate agency for Africans,\nwas often used as a meeting place, particularly by those from the Transkei.\nSisulu came from humble origins and grew up in circumstances far rougher\nthan anything Mandela had ever experienced. His father was a white government\nofficial, Victor Dickinson, who played no part in his upbringing; his mother,\nAlice Sisulu, was a Thembu domestic servant. Born in , Sisulu spent his\nchildhood in the Transkei looked after by Thembu aunts and uncles. All were\ndevout Anglicans. Prayers were said twice a day at his uncle\u2019s house and every\nSunday there was a service at the Anglican church hut. The household was often\nvisited by white churchmen. But Sisulu grew up disliking the deferential attitude\nthat his family members invariably assumed in the presence of whites: \u2018I\nresented being told how I must behave towards whites.\u2019 His own light\ncomplexion, setting him apart from his African peers, was a constant source of\nannoyance. So rude was his behaviour toward white visitors that one of his aunts\nseriously rebuked him. \u2018I doubt whether you\u2019ll be allowed to work for a white\nman,\u2019 she said. \u2018You won\u2019t make a man, because you can\u2019t serve.\u2019 At the local\nAnglican mission school which he attended, the tales from the Bible that he most\nrelished were those of Moses and David and the struggle of the Jews against\nforeign rule.\nSisulu followed the path that so many other young men in the Transkei were\ntaking. He left school at the age of sixteen, with little more than a basic\neducation, and headed by train for Johannesburg. Unable to find a job on the\nmines at first, he worked as a labourer at a dairy for several months, returned\nhome briefly, then signed up for a four-month contract as an underground miner\nat Rose Deep Mine, hating the work, the living conditions and his white bosses.\nMoving to Johannesburg with his mother and sister in the s, he took a\nsuccession of factory jobs, clashing time and again with white supervisors,\nbecoming ever more embittered and aggressive. One evening, sitting in a train\non his way home to Orlando, he watched a white ticket collector harass a young\nAfrican girl for no apparent reason. Enraged by this, he intervened, fell into a\nfight with the ticket collector, was arrested and sent briefly to prison\u2014\u2018hell itself\n\u2019. In his spare time, he developed an intense interest in Xhosa history, joined a\n\n\fXhosa social group, the Orlando Brotherly Society, and wrote articles on Xhosa\nheroes for the white-owned Bantu World. Then, in , he was introduced to\nthe African National Congress, a small organisation attempting to revive African\npolitical activity. It became his political home.\nThe young man who came to see him in his office impressed Sisulu. He\nexplained that he had fallen foul of the Fort Hare authorities, that he intended to\nstudy by correspondence course to finish his degree and that he wanted to\nbecome a lawyer. His royal connections, his dignified bearing, his evident\nambition all seemed promising material. Sisulu quickly recognised his potential:\n\u2018I saw a bright young man with high ideals.\u2019 Sisulu offered him a job at his\nestate agency and decided to make inquiries of a white lawyer with whom he had\nbusiness dealings in the property market to see whether some opening could be\nfound for him.\nLazar Sidelsky was an unusual lawyer. Coming from a modest Jewish family\nfrom a rural district in eastern Transvaal, where he was born in , he had\nfound it difficult, after graduating from the University of the Witwatersrand in\nJohannesburg, to obtain a position with an established law firm and so had set up\nhis own partnership, known as Witkin, Sidelsky, and Eidelman, concentrating on\nthe African property market for business. He was regarded in the African\ncommunity as fair-minded, conscientious and helpful. When African clients\nvisited his office, he allowed them to sit down\u2014something unheard of in other\nwhite law firms. He worked in conjunction with a German businessman, Philip\nMuller, who was involved in constructing houses and rooms for Africans in the\nfew areas of Johannesburg, like Sophiatown and Alexandra, where freehold titles\nwere still available to them. The business was profitable.\nWhen Mandela called at his office on the fourth floor in the Old Mutual\nBuilding in Commissioner Street, Sidelsky, remembering his own difficulty in\nfinding an opening in the legal field, was inclined to be sympathetic. Mandela\nhad a pleasing manner, was a member of a royal family and came with a\nrecommendation from Sisulu, a man whose judgement Sidelsky respected. \u2018I had\nno difficulty in saying yes,\u2019 he recalled. Sidelsky agreed to employ Mandela as a\nclerk while he completed his university degree by correspondence course with\nthe University of South Africa, studying at night. After that, he could serve his\narticles with Sidelsky, while studying law, as part of his legal qualification. For a\nyoung African to be offered a position as an articled clerk with a white law firm\nin Johannesburg in the s was extremely rare. What made it even more\n\n\fremarkable was that Sidelsky waived the premium normally paid by articled\nclerks. From being perilously close to early failure, Mandela, through Sisulu\u2019s\nintervention, had secured a future.\nMandela and Sidelsky developed a high regard for each other. Mandela,\njoining the firm at the age of twenty-three, was engaged at first in simple tasks\nbut gradually extended the range of his work, handling contracts with African\nclients, acting as interpreter and dealing with wills and divorces. At each stage,\nSidelsky took care to explain the firm\u2019s procedures, the reasons for them and the\nwider purposes of the law. He was also a generous employer, providing Mandela\nwith an old suit and a shirt. In later years, Mandela was to remember Sidelsky as\n\u2018a man who trained me to serve our country\u2019. Sidelsky, for his part, found\nMandela an agreeable employee: \u2018It was a pleasure to have him around. He had\nan intelligent grasp of what was required.\u2019\nThere was one other African at the firm, Gaur Radebe, ten years older than\nMandela. Sidelsky employed Radebe on an occasional basis for a variety of jobs,\nusually on the property side of the business: salesman, clerk, messenger,\ninterpreter. He was streetwise, smooth-talking and fluent in English, Sotho and\nZulu; a short, stocky man, he was well known in the townships. Radebe led a\nmultiple life. At heart a political agitator, he had joined the Communist Party in\nthe s and he was also active in the ANC. As the secretary for mines in the\nANC\u2019s Transvaal branch, he had played a leading role in launching the African\nMineworkers\u2019 Union in . He was prominent too in organising protest\nagainst the public transport system from Alexandra township, where he was\nbased. He was often outspoken, particularly on a political platform and\noccasionally even with Sidelsky. He was also known to be unscrupulous. He was\nexpelled by the Communist Party in  as a result of his moneylending\nactivities in Alexandra. He dabbled in the illicit diamond trade. Usually short of\nmoney, he borrowed from Sidelsky without repaying and tended to live off his\nwife, a hard-working teacher. But he was useful to Sidelsky, and Sidelsky\nregarded him with a certain affection. Their business relationship continued on\nand off for many years.\nUpon Mandela, Radebe exerted a strong influence. They shared an office and\nMandela was struck by Radebe\u2019s audacious attitude towards whites. He was\nfond of telling the story of how, on his first day in the office, a white secretary,\nexplaining that there was no colour bar in the firm, told him that, in honour of\nhis arrival, two new teacups had been purchased, one for him and the other for\n\n\fRadebe. These were the ones they were to take from the tray when the tea boy\ncame round. When Mandela relayed the news to Radebe, Radebe responded with\na mischievous look. \u2018Nelson, just do as I do,\u2019 he said. When tea arrived, Radebe,\nwith other members of the staff present, ostentatiously avoided the new cups and\nchose an old one. Mandela, wanting neither to cause offence to the secretaries\nnor to alienate his new colleague, declined to take any tea at all. He subsequently\ndrank tea on his own.\nRadebe\u2019s political views also made an impact. Mandela was still untutored in\npolitics. His primary loyalty remained with the Thembu. Radebe, however,\nstressed the importance of a wider political loyalty, as advocated by the ANC in\nits campaigns for African rights. His commitment to the African cause made a\nstrong impression on Mandela, but Mandela remained aloof from political\ninvolvement. Having had a narrow escape from trouble, his ambition to qualify\nas a lawyer was all the stronger. He was mindful of warnings from Sidelsky to\nsteer clear of politics, which, his employer stressed, would lead only to ruin.\nIt was at the firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman that Mandela made his\nfirst white friend. Nat Bregman, a cousin of Sidelsky, was from a poor Jewish\nfamily and had been taken on as an articled clerk, just before Mandela arrived, at\nthe age of eighteen. He was already a member of the Communist Party, but he\nremained, in his own words, \u2018a light-hearted communist\u2019. His main interest was\nin show business. He participated in left-wing shows to raise money for Soviet\nwar charities and went on to perform as a part-time professional comedian at the\nPlastic Theatre in the white suburb of Northcliff. He introduced Mandela to\nlectures at the Left Club in Commissioner Street and invited him to multiracial\ngatherings which Communist Party members organised. For about three years,\nthey shared an office on the fourth floor of the Old Mutual Building, often using\nthe same lift when they were supposed to use separate ones. Bregman\nremembered Mandela at the time as \u2018a quiet, studious, and reserved person\u2019 but\nwith a good sense of humour that could bring a lighter touch to general\nconversation. Mandela enjoyed Bregman\u2019s talent for mimicry and was impressed\nby his colour-blind attitude to life. Indeed, it was a remarkable stroke of good\nfortune that Mandela, so soon after his ill-planned arrival in Johannesburg in\n, should have found himself in the hands of an enlightened white employer,\nwith a radical black activist and an easygoing white youth for company.\nMandela\u2019s home life was rudimentary. After staying briefly with his cousin in\nGeorge Goch township, he found lodgings in Alexandra. It was called \u2018Dark\n\n\fCity\u2019, for there were no streetlights or electricity supply. The roads were\nunpaved, sanitation was primitive, disease was rife and a pall of smoke from\ncoal stoves polluted the air. The streets were roamed by young tsotsis. On most\nmornings, the sight of a corpse lying in a gutter caused no surprise. An everincreasing population was crammed into this one square mile, many of them\n\u2018illegals\u2019 arriving from rural areas without proper documents. Plot owners used\nevery available space to build rooms and shacks in their backyards, filling them\nwith as many tenants as possible. Many premises were the haunts of thieves and\nprostitutes or used by shebeen queens running illegal drinking dens. Police raids\nin Alexandra were commonplace.\nMandela\u2019s lodgings were at  Seventh Avenue, the home of the Xhoma\nfamily. He occupied a tin-roofed room with a dirt floor at the back of the\nproperty. There was no running water, or electricity, or heating. He had no\nmoney for comfort. His salary of \u00a3 per week was hardly enough to cover his\nbasic needs, for rent, bus fares, food and candles for studying at night. There was\nalso the cost of his correspondence course with the University of South Africa.\nSometimes he walked nine miles to work and back again to save money.\nSometimes he had no money even for food. The only reliable hot meal of the\nweek came on Sundays, thanks to the kindness of the Xhoma family. Girlfriends\nprovided the occasional meal, and white secretaries in the office also helped him\nwith food, but often Mandela went hungry. The suit that Sidelsky gave him was\nstitched and patched again and again, year after year.\nDespite the poverty and squalor of Alexandra, Mandela developed an\naffection for the township. It was the first place he regarded as home after\nThembuland. He enjoyed its cosmopolitan nature\u2014the mingling of different\ntribes and languages, the sense of camaraderie that came from belonging to\nAlexandra. He stayed for only a year, before taking advantage of an offer of free\naccommodation in a mine compound closer to the city centre, but always looked\nback to his time there with fondness.\nHis roots with Thembuland meanwhile steadily loosened. In , his old\nguardian, Jongintaba, died. Mandela had met him the previous year while he was\non a visit to Johannesburg. He had seemed then to be ageing rapidly. They did\nnot speak of the matters that had set them apart, neither Mandela\u2019s expulsion\nfrom Fort Hare nor his flight from the marriage that Jongintaba had arranged.\nJongintaba was more interested in his current plans. On learning of his death,\nMandela travelled to Mqhekezweni, though he arrived there too late to attend the\n\n\ffuneral. He found the Great Place unchanged, but realised how much his own\nambitions had altered. He was no longer interested in a career as a clerk or an\ninterpreter in the civil service. Nor did he see his future bound up any longer\nwith Thembuland or the Transkei. The new world he had entered seemed to offer\nfar greater possibilities.\nAt the end of , Mandela passed the final examination for his Bachelor of\nArts degree and early the following year returned to Fort Hare for his graduation,\nproudly wearing a new suit for which Walter Sisulu had provided the funds.\nBoth his mother and Jongintaba\u2019s widow, NoEngland, attended the ceremony. It\nwas an occasion which once again reminded him of how distant his old dreams\nand ambitions now seemed. Although Kaizer Matanzima pressed him to return\nto Umtata after qualifying as an attorney, he realised he no longer felt any urge\nto go there.\nBack in Johannesburg, Mandela enrolled as a part-time law student at the\nUniversity of the Witwatersrand, one of four English-speaking universities\nwhich permitted blacks to attend specialist courses. The campus was on a hilltop\nin the district of Braamfontein, north of the city centre. The student body there\nwas almost entirely white. In the law faculty, Mandela was the only African. The\nexperience of dealing with white students was as new to him as dealing with a\nblack student was to them. Some reacted in traditional white fashion, keeping\nthemselves apart. One law teacher, Professor H. R. Hahlo, made clear his view\nthat Africans were not sufficiently disciplined to master the subtleties of law.\nBut with others he made lifelong friendships. A part-time law lecturer, Bram\nFischer, who came from a prominent Afrikaner family but was also a senior\nfigure in the Communist Party, was to exert the most profound influence on\nMandela. Among his fellow students, also studying law, was Harold Wolpe, the\nson of a poor Jewish immigrant family who had joined the Young Communist\nLeague at the age of seventeen. Another left-wing activist at \u2018Wits\u2019 was Ruth\nFirst, a brilliant eighteen-year-old social science student, also from a Jewish\nimmigrant family active in Communist Party politics. Mandela\u2019s fellow students\ngenerally remembered him as being \u2018a little shy, not assertive in any way\u2019. Harry\nSchwarz recalled, \u2018He was very quiet, never a major participant in class debates\nor discussion.\u2019\nMandela also made his first friends in the Indian community. Ismail Meer was\na law student from Natal whose flat on the fourth floor of Kholvad House in\nMarket Street was a regular meeting place for Indian students where Mandela\n\n\ftoo could often be found. Both Meer and his close friend Jaydew Singh were\nactive in Indian politics and also joined the Communist Party.\nIt was in the company of Meer, Singh and a third Indian student, Ahmed\nBhoda, that Mandela had another brush with the police. Hastening to get from\nWits to Kholvad House one day, all four boarded a tram to take them to Market\nStreet. They had not gone far when the white conductor, turning to the Indians,\nbawled in Afrikaans, \u2018Hey, you are not allowed to carry a kaffir.\u2019 A heated\nexchange followed. The conductor stopped the tram and called a policeman, who\narrested the Indians \u2018for carrying a kaffir and disturbing the conductor in his\nduty\u2019. All four were escorted to Marshall Square police station. There Mandela\nwas taken aside and encouraged to make a statement against the three Indians,\nwhich he refused to do. Ordered to appear in court the next day, the students\nsought help from Bram Fischer, who agreed to act as their advocate. In court, the\nmagistrate greeted Fischer warmly, mentioning that he had just returned from the\nOrange Free State, where he had had the honour to meet Fischer\u2019s father, the\nJudge President there. The accused were quickly acquitted.\nAs well as his work at Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman and his studies at Wits,\nMandela began to take a closer interest in the political world around him, in the\nweb of laws and regulations that kept Africans in a subordinate role and\ndeprived them of a political voice. Under the influence of Walter Sisulu, he was\ndrawn increasingly into the orbit of the ANC. His ambition to qualify as a\nlawyer did not waver. When Sidelsky gave him an increase in salary, he was\npleased to hear, after asking Mandela what he would do with the extra money,\nMandela\u2019s reply that he would spend it on more candles to help his studies at\nnight. But Mandela\u2019s own political ambitions had nevertheless begun to stir. In\nthe office that they shared, Nat Bregman remembered vividly the occasion when\nMandela told him, \u2018One day, I\u2019m going to be prime minister of South Africa.\u2019\n\nWhen Mandela first encountered the ANC, its fortunes were at a low ebb. For\nthirty years, ANC leaders had tried to gain a hearing from the government for\ntheir demands for greater African rights. But every method they had tried\u2014\npolite petitions, deputations and appeals\u2014had failed. Dissatisfied with the way\nthe old guard of politicians had run the organisation, a group of young radicals\nbegan meeting in Johannesburg in  to plot a more militant course of action.\nIt was to this small group that Mandela was introduced by Sisulu.\n\n\fThe founders of the ANC were mostly conservative men, schooled in the\nChristian tradition, respectful of authority and concerned largely with their own\nposition in society. When they gathered on a sweltering day in January  in a\ncommunity hall in a black location in Bloemfontein, formally dressed in suits,\nfrock coats and top hats and carrying furled umbrellas, their main objectives, to\ndefend African rights and to campaign against racial discrimination, were\nnotably modest. They were members of an African elite, brought up to believe in\nthe inherent value of Western rules and anxious to prove their worth as loyal\ncitizens. What had brought them together was not so much the urge to agitate for\nadvancement as the fear that their existing privileges were under threat.\nThe tradition that Britain had established for the Cape Colony, on the occasion\nof granting it representative government in , was to accord equal political\nrights to all men over the age of twenty-one provided they passed certain\nproperty or income qualifications. Any African was entitled to vote if he\nqualified. The initial black electorate was small but grew in time to form a\nsignificant minority, drawn from the constantly rising number of educated\nAfricans turned out by missionary schools\u2014teachers, priests, clerks, interpreters,\njournalists and traders.\nThe African elite put much faith in what they referred to as the \u2018white sense of\nfair play\u2019 and went to great lengths to demonstrate their suitability to participate\nin politics, turning themselves into model citizens. They dressed in formal\nVictorian attire, went regularly to church, abstained from alcohol, put portraits of\nQueen Victoria in their sitting rooms and revered the game of cricket, forming\ntheir own teams (which often beat their white opponents). But it was all to little\navail.\nThe first blow to their aspirations came at the end of the Anglo-Boer War in\n, when Britain took control of the two Boer repub - lics of the Transvaal and\nthe Orange Free State. The African elite had hoped that the political traditions\nestablished by Britain in the Cape Colony would now be applied to the two\nnorthern territories and also the neighbouring British colony of Natal. Hitherto,\nno political rights had been accorded to them there. The Transvaal constitution\nhad bluntly stated that \u2018the people desire to permit no equality between coloured\npeople and the white inhabitants, either in Church or State\u2019. The only\nrelationship tolerated between white and black was that of master and servant. A\nsimilar colour bar had operated in the Orange Free State. In Natal the\nqualification for black voters was so rigorous that only two Africans had\n\n\fobtained the vote.\nBritain\u2019s main preoccupation at the end of the war was to achieve\nreconciliation between the Boers and the British, and the Boers were adamantly\nopposed to the notion of political rights for Africans. Accordingly, the terms of\nthe peace treaty agreed at Vereeniging excluded \u2018natives\u2019 from the franchise in\nthe two former republics until the question was reconsidered \u2018after the\nintroduction of self-government\u2019. This came as a rude shock to the African elite.\nOne petition submitted by an African group in the Transvaal questioned why the\nBoers, who had been \u2018enemies of the King and British principles\u2019, should be\nfavourably treated while the interests of Africans, who had shown their loyalty\nby \u2018heart and deeds\u2019, should be ignored. For years ahead, African spokesmen in\nall four territories continued to denounce the treaty of Vereeniging as one of the\ngreatest injustices perpetrated against them.\nWorse was to follow. Having gained control over four southern African\nterritories, each of which maintained different traditions and different laws\naffecting the African population, the British authorities were keen to establish \u2018a\ncommon understanding on questions of native policy\u2019 in order to facilitate their\nintegration into a new dominion at some future date. The man entrusted with this\ntask, the British High Commissioner Lord Milner, had strong views of his own\non the subject. \u2018A political equality of white and black is impossible,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018The white man must rule because he is elevated by many, many steps above the\nblack man.\u2019\nIn , he appointed a South African Native Affairs Commission under the\nchairmanship of Sir Godfrey Lagden, the Commissioner for Native Affairs, to\ninvestigate the matter. The Lagden Commission report, issued in , was to\nhave a profound impact on South African thinking on race relations.\nIts members were mostly English-speaking and regarded as representing\nprogressive opinion on native matters; in parliament they were described as \u2018proNative men\u2019. Their main recommendation was that whites and blacks should be\nkept separate in politics and in land occupation and ownership on a permanent\nbasis. In order to avoid an \u2018intolerable situation\u2019 in the future whereby white\nvoters might be outnumbered by black voters, a system of separate rep resentation should be established for the black population, though political\npower, of course, would always remain in white hands. Land should also be\ndemarcated into white and black areas, as the report said, \u2018with a view to\n\n\ffinality\u2019. In urban areas, separate \u2018locations\u2019 should be created for African\ntownsmen. These ideas on the need for segregation between white and black\nwere widely held at the time, by friends of the black population as well as by\nadversaries. The significance of the Lagden Commission was that it elevated\npractices of segregation commonly employed throughout South Africa during\nthe nineteenth century to the level of political doctrine. Segregation was used by\nevery leading white politician as a respectable slogan.\nBritain\u2019s subsequent plans to establish a union between the Cape Colony,\nNatal, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal galvanized the African elite into\nnational opposition for the first time. The draft constitution for a united South\nAfrica drawn up by white parliamentary representatives from the four colonies\nand released in  excluded Africans from the franchise in Natal, the\nTransvaal and the Orange Free State, curbed the right of Cape Africans to sit in\nparliament, thus making it an all-white institution, and imposed on the Cape\nAfrican electorate a condition that their right to vote could be removed through a\ntwo-thirds majority vote of the upper and lower houses of parliament sitting in\njoint session. The African view was that the proposed constitution was a sell-out\nto politicians from the northern territories. \u2018This is treachery,\u2019 remarked Alan\nSoga, a prominent journalist. \u2018It is worse. It is a successful betrayal, for the Act\nhas virtually disenfranchised the black man, even before the meeting of the\nUnion Parliament.\u2019\nAn unprecedented number of protests followed, most couched in suitably\nrespectful terms. A protest meeting of prominent Africans in Waaihoek location\nin Bloemfontein thanked the authorities for \u2018giving the delegates the opportunity\nto hold the meeting and to exercise free speech\u2019 and sent expressions of loyalty\nto the Governor, the High Commissioner and King Edward VII. A delegation\nwas sent to London to make representations. But Britain\u2019s House of Commons\nsaw no reason to amend the constitution and it came into effect in \nunaltered. From then on, Britain left South Africa to its own devices.\nRealising that further assaults on their position were likely, African leaders\nresolved to form a national organisation to defend their rights. Much of the\ninitiative came from a young Zulu lawyer, Pixley Seme, who had recently\nreturned to South Africa to establish a law practice in Johannesburg, after\nstudying at Columbia University in New York and Jesus College, Oxford. He\nwas adamant about the need for a united front. \u2018The demon of racialism, the\naberrations of the Xhosa-Fingo [Mfengu] feud, the animosity that exists between\n\n\fthe Zulus and the Tongas, between the Basuto and every other Native must be\nburied and forgotten,\u2019 he wrote in . \u2018We are one people. These divisions,\nthese jealousies, are the cause of all our woes and of all our backwardness and\nignorance today.\u2019\nThe following year, at the inaugural conference of the South African Native\nNational Congress, as the ANC was first called, Seme chose the same theme.\nGiving the keynote address to an audience of several hundred Africans, both\ndelegates and observers, he pointed out that their meeting was the first time \u2018so\nmany elements representing different tongues and tribes ever attempted to\ncooperate under one umbrella\u2019. Their purpose was straightforward: \u2018The white\npeople of this country have formed what is known as the Union of South Africa\n\u2014a union in which we have no voice in the making of laws and no part in the\nadministration. We have called you, therefore, to this conference so that we can\ntogether find ways and means of forming our national union for the purpose of\ncreating national unity and defending our rights and privileges.\u2019\nThe first challenge was soon upon them. In  the government put forward\nland legislation prohibiting Africans from purchasing or leasing land outside\nareas designated as Native reserves, patches of territory scattered throughout\nSouth Africa, numbering nearly  at the time, which had survived the era of\nwhite occupation intact. The reserves varied in size from a few square miles to\nlarge districts. In the old Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free\nState, only a tiny fraction of land had officially been set aside for Native\nreserves, while in the Cape Colony and Natal, as a result of the military strength\nof Nguni chiefdoms like the Xhosa and Zulu, extensive areas remained under\nAfrican control. The reserves then amounted to no more than about  per cent of\nthe country. They were already showing signs of overcrowding, overstocking\nand land degradation. Acknowledging that the reserves were not large enough to\nhold their existing populations for long, the government made provision for the\n\u2018release\u2019 of additional areas for Native purchase at some future date.\nThe impact of the Natives\u2019 Land Act of  was felt most immediately in\nareas outside the reserves, where nearly a million Africans lived as tenants,\nsharecroppers and labour tenants on white-owned land. It was particularly severe\nin the Orange Free State, where sharecroppers, who for years had earned a living\nby giving half of their produce to white farmers in return for land, were\nsummarily evicted. Some sought refuge in the overcrowded reserves; others\nwere forced, after selling their livestock and implements, to work as labourers\n\n\ffor white farmers. The plight of these destitute families driven off the land was\ndescribed by Sol Plaatje, the ANC secretary-general, in his Native Life in South\nAfrica. \u2018Awakening on Friday morning,  June ,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018the South\nAfrican Native found himself not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his\nbirth.\u2019 Plaatje recorded how, travelling through the Orange Free State by bicycle\nin the winter of , he found bands of African peasants trudging from one\nplace to the next in search of a farmer who might give them shelter, their women\nand children shivering with cold in the winter nights, their livestock emaciated\nand starving: \u2018It looks as if these people were so many fugitives escaping from a\nwar.\u2019 A whole class of prosperous farmers was eventually destroyed.\nAll the protests and deputations mounted by the ANC against the legislation\nproved ineffective. The ANC\u2019s main argument was based not so much on its\nopposition to the principle of segregation but on the inequitable distribution of\nland. The government\u2019s pledge to release further areas for African purchase was\nnot forthcoming for another twenty-three years. In , the total amount of land\nreserved for Africans was increased from  to  per cent. By then, as official\nreports warned, the reserves had degenerated towards \u2018desert conditions\u2019: they\nwere \u2018congested, denuded, overstocked, eroded and for the most part in a\ndeplorable condition\u2019; the \u2018process of ruination\u2019 there threatened \u2018an appalling\nproblem of Native poverty\u2019.\nThe same process of segregation was applied to towns and to employment.\nAfrican entry into urban areas was regulated more strictly through greater use of\nthe pass system. Africans deemed surplus to the labour needs of white\nhouseholds, or those leading \u2018an idle, dissolute or disorderly life\u2019, could be\ndeported to the reserves. Separate \u2018locations\u2019 on the outskirts of white urban and\nindustrial areas were set aside for African occupation. Work opportunities for\nAfricans were severely curtailed. The common tendency had always been to\nconfine Africans to unskilled work in mines, on farms and in domestic service.\nThe Union government now proceeded to enforce an industrial colour bar\nexcluding Africans from skilled employment in the mines, on the railways and in\nthe civil service. By the s, South Africa had developed an economic system\nallocating skills and high wages to whites and heavy labour and menial tasks to\nblacks on meagre pay. The ANC\u2019s efforts to withstand this onslaught of\nsegregation had a negligible effect.\nThe ultimate humiliation came in , when African voters were struck from\nthe common roll in the Cape Province, losing a right they had held for more than\n\n\feighty years. In exchange for the loss of their franchise, they were given a\nseparate roll which allowed them to vote for three white representatives to speak\non their behalf in the House of Assembly and four white members of the Senate.\nThey were also entitled to elect twelve members of a new Native Representative\nCouncil. But the council was a purely advisory body, without legislative or\nfinancial power. The only benefit from this arrangement was that Africans in the\nnorthern provinces obtained some form of representation for the first time. The\npractical effect of the new legislation, the Representation of Natives Act, was\nlimited. By , African voters in the Cape numbered some ,, amounting\nto only . per cent of the provincial electorate, and only . per cent of the\nUnion\u2019s electorate. But the political significance was crucial. As the historian\nCornelis de Kiewiet noted, \u2018To destroy the Cape native franchise was to destroy\nthe most important bridge between the worlds of two races.\u2019\n\nContemptuous of the polite methods of protest that ANC leaders had employed\nto so little effect, the circle of young radicals whom Mandela joined were\nimpatient for confrontation with white authority. They were mostly teachers and\nother young professional men, with a core group numbering no more than two\ndozen. Few of them possessed political experience and none had any clear idea\nof what practical measures to pursue. But they were galvanized by a new vision\nof an African future inspired largely by the group\u2019s leading intellectual, Anton\nLembede, a twenty-nine-year-old former teacher who had arrived in\nJohannesburg in  to train as a lawyer.\nWhen Mandela first met Lembede at Sisulu\u2019s house in Orlando in , he\nwas immediately impressed by the breadth of his learning. Born into a family of\nZulu farm labourers, Lembede had pursued a life of intense study and regular\nprayer, driving himself relentlessly in quest of educational and professional\nachievement. He was fond of discoursing at length about the history of nations\nfrom ancient Greece to the modern era. As Mandela noted, Lembede tended to\nbe verbose, but he was nevertheless struck by the boldness of the man\u2019s ideas.\nLembede\u2019s message was that Africa belonged to Africans. \u2018Africa is a black\nman\u2019s country,\u2019 Lembede argued. \u2018Africans are the natives of Africa and they\nhave inhabited Africa, their Motherland, from times immemorial. Africa belongs\nto them.\u2019\nAt the heart of Lembede\u2019s philosophy of \u2018Africanism\u2019, as it came to be called,\n\n\flay a determination to assert an African identity, to give Africans control of their\nown future, to use African political power to change South African society. To\ndepend on whites for help was considered a waste of time. No group other than\nAfricans would free them from oppression. Other groups, whether white liberals\nor communists, would merely seek to subordinate African interests to their own.\nAfricans should unite as one people, regardless of their tribal origins or social\nstatus. They should stop emulating white leadership and white culture and\ndevelop pride and confidence in their own political culture. They needed a\n\u2018nation-building\u2019 faith\u2014a faith in their own worth, a pride in their past, a sense\nof self-reliance and confidence in their ability to determine their own future.\nThis would dispel the sense of inferiority that Africans felt and attract mass\nsupport. Mass mobilisation in turn would achieve political results.\nCompared to the respectful approach long favoured by ANC leaders, with\ntheir belief in the value of moral argument and their disdain for mass\nmobilisation, Lembede\u2019s ideas offered exciting prospects. Though aware of his\nown lack of experience and knowledge, Mandela was keen to play a part.\nA meeting of young dissidents discontented with the ANC\u2019s leadership was\nsoon organised. Among those who attended was Oliver Tambo, Mandela\u2019s\nfriend from Fort Hare, who had returned to Johannesburg to take up a teaching\npost at St Peter\u2019s, an Anglican school which he had attended as a student.\nPopularly known as \u2018The Christian\u2019, he had fallen foul of the college authorities\nat Fort Hare in , while studying for a postgraduate teaching diploma, over a\nwritten pledge they required from students regarding their religious conduct. \u2018I\nknew I could not sign that pledge,\u2019 he later told Father Trevor Huddleston, the\nSuperintendent of St Peter\u2019s School. \u2018It demanded something from me that I\ncould not give. It would have killed my religion stone dead: an agreement with\nGod, written and signed! I could not do it!\u2019 So he had been expelled. Hearing of\nan unexpected vacancy at St Peter\u2019s, he had returned there in , at the age of\ntwenty-five, as a mathematics teacher.\nBy the end of a long evening, the dissidents were convinced of the need to\nform a youth movement that would steer the ANC towards radical action. They\ntentatively called themselves the Congress Youth League. But first they had to\npersuade the ANC hierarchy to give them formal approval. Many of the old\nguard were hostile to their young critics, seeing them as a threat to their own\nposition. Others, however, were aware that the ANC needed to develop a more\naggressive response to reflect the mood of restlessness and discontent growing\n\n\famong the African population.\nIn the early s, massive numbers of Africans moved to industrial centres\non the Witwatersrand, driven by poverty and hunger in the reserves and by harsh\nconditions on white farms. They were hoping to find work in booming wartime\nindustries, but often met with little but hardship and squalor. The housing\nshortage reached crisis proportions. The cost of food soared. A sudden rash of\nindustrial action broke out.\nIn the township of Alexandra, Mandela was given his first taste of protest. In\nAugust , when bus fares from Alexandra to central Johannesburg were\nraised from fourpence to fivepence, causing serious difficulty for factory, office\nand domestic workers, some , people boycotted the bus service. Some\nwere given lifts in cars or lorries, often by sympathetic whites, but most of them\ntrudged the nine miles or more to work and back again, day after day, blocking\nall other traffic for miles along Johannesburg\u2019s main northern highway.\nProminent among the organisers of the boycott was Gaur Radebe. Mandela\njoined the stream of marchers with a sense of exhilaration at participating in\npopular protest and he was duly impressed by the result. After nine days of\nrunning empty buses, the bus owners reinstated the old fare.\nWhen a delegation of young dissidents approached the ANC president, Dr\nAlfred Xuma, hoping to gain his support for founding a Youth League, was\nsceptical about their intentions. A distinguished doctor who had qualified at\nuniversities in the United States, Britain and Hungary, before returning to\nJohannesburg in  to establish a medical practice, Xuma had set about trying\nto infuse the ANC with greater vigour and to reorganise its chaotic\nadministration and finances. He had played a leading role in drawing up a\ndocument entitled \u2018African Claims\u2019, which demanded full citizenship rights and\nan end to all discriminatory laws, in accordance with the Atlantic Charter drawn\nup by Churchill and Roosevelt in , supporting the right of all peoples to\nchoose their own government. But he was an aloof and authoritarian figure who\nlacked the common touch, finding it difficult to mix with unsophisticated blacks\nand preferring a circle of mainly white friends; his vivacious wife, Madie Hall, a\nblack American and a qualified social worker, was socially ambitious. Xuma\nwarned the dissidents that it would be a great mistake to think that Africans\ncould \u2018march barefoot\u2019 against their opponents.\nNevertheless, in December , at the annual conference of the ANC in\n\n\fBloemfontein, delegates approved the formation of the Congress Youth League.\nTwo months later, bearing a copy of their draft manifesto for him to review, a\nYouth League deputation led by Lembede called on Xuma at his large house in\nSophiatown. Mandela was present, along with Sisulu and Tambo. While they\nwaited for Xuma to arrive, Madie expounded her own views that the tactics\nemployed by black Americans\u2014patient conduct, education and economic selfhelp\u2014would eventually pay dividends in South Africa.\nXuma was none too pleased with the draft manifesto. It contained virulent\ncriticism of the old methods of the ANC. Nor did he take kindly to the Youth\nLeague\u2019s demands for a programme of action, as a record of the meeting\nshowed:\nDr Xuma replied that the Africans as a group were unorganized and\nundisciplined, and that a programme of action such as envisaged by the Youth\nLeague would be rash at this stage. The ANC lacked people who were concerned\nabout the movement and who knew what they wanted. Action would merely lead\nto exposure. The masses of the people were unorganized and only committees\nexisted in the ANC . . . He felt that what was really wrong with the manifesto\nwas the tone of criticism and the expressions used. The committee should start\noff without antagonizing anyone.\nThe Youth League paid little heed. When it appeared in March , the\nmanifesto was still bristling with criticism. It accused the ANC of adopting a\npolicy of yielding to oppression, \u2018regarding itself as a body of gentlemen with\nclean hands\u2019. It had come to represent only a privileged few who were out of\ntouch with the needs of the rank and file, was poorly organised and had no\nproper following. The formation of the Youth League was \u2018a protest against the\nlack of discipline and the absence of a clearly defined goal\u2019. It would become the\n\u2018brainstrust and power-station\u2019 of African nationalism, giving \u2018force, direction\nand vigour to the struggle for African National Freedom\u2019.\nOn Easter Sunday in April , at a meeting of about  people at the\nBantu Men\u2019s Social Centre in Eloff Street in central Johannesburg, the Congress\nYouth League was formally launched, with a series of rousing speeches.\nLembede was elected as president, Tambo as secretary and Sisulu as treasurer.\nAlthough Mandela was elected to the executive committee, the role he had\nplayed in the formation of the Youth League was a minor one. He was working\nfull-time at Sidelsky\u2019s law firm and part-time as a student at the University of\n\n\fthe Witwatersrand, leaving him little opportunity for other activities. Compared\nto the likes of Lembede, he still regarded himself as a novice. In time, however,\nthe Youth League was to become the vehicle for his own political ambition.\n\nThe Sisulu home at  Orlando West, a small brick house near the railway\nline in the middle of the township, welcomed a constant stream of friends and\nvisitors. As well as providing a meeting place for the political activists who\ngathered there, Sisulu was always ready to advise and help with people\u2019s\nproblems. His many acts of kindness were renowned in the local community.\nAlso on hand at  Orlando was his mother, Ma Sisulu, long accustomed to\nproviding meals for sudden arrivals. Then, in , Sisulu married a twentyfive-year-old nurse, Albertina Thethiwe. In a speech at the wedding reception,\nDr Xuma said to Albertina, \u2018Let me warn you, you are marrying a man who is\nalready married. He is married to the nation.\u2019 Their partnership did indeed have\nto endure many ordeals; it was also to form the centre of a network of close\nrelationships of which Mandela was a part.\nBorn into a peasant farming family in the Transkei, Albertina, at the age of\neleven, had been placed in charge of caring for four siblings after her father died\nand her mother was too ill to look after them. She swore never to marry but to\ndedicate her life to bringing them up. Friends at her Catholic school in the\nTranskei called her the Virgin Mary because she refused to loiter with boys at\nthe train station on the way home. She performed well in school and a priest\noffered to help her with a bursary for further education. \u2018I suggested I became a\nnun, so I could always look after my older brother, who was illiterate, and the\nyoungest, who was only a baby. The priest told me a nun would have to be\nmarried to the church. So I became a nurse.\u2019 It was while she was training at the\nNon-European General Hospital in Hillbrow, Johannesburg, that in  she met\na cousin of Sisulu who introduced them. Albertina instilled in Walter a new\nsense of confidence, making him less sensitive about his light complexion. \u2018I\u2019m\nblack enough for both of us,\u2019 she used to say.\nMandela spent more and more time at the Sisulus\u2019 house, regarding it as a\nhome from home. Ma Sisulu took a great liking to him and Walter regarded him\nas his closest friend. They made an odd couple. Mandela had a tall, athletic\nfigure, a commanding presence and a patrician manner. He was invariably well\ndressed. \u2018The beautiful white silk scarf he wore around his neck stands out in my\n\n\fmind to this day,\u2019 the writer Ellen Kuzwayo recalled years later. Sisulu was\nshort, stocky and bespectacled. He had a habit at times of nervously biting his\nlip. His smile revealed a wide gap in his front teeth. At meetings of the Youth\nLeague, they tended to sit together, Mandela dressed in a suit and polished\nshoes, Sisulu usually wearing a lumber jacket and sturdy boots. Mandela was\nimpatient for action; Sisulu was always careful to weigh up the consequences.\nIt was at the Sisulus\u2019 house that Mandela met an attractive twenty-two-yearold nurse named Evelyn Mase. She was indirectly related to Walter\u2019s mother and\nwas also a friend of Albertina, training at the same hospital in Hillbrow. Ma\nSisulu introduced them, mentioning that Mandela was studying law at the\nUniversity of the Witwatersrand. \u2018He was handsome and charming and he made\nme laugh,\u2019 Evelyn remembered of their first meeting. \u2018He flirted and said he\nwould come to see me at the hospital.\u2019\nEvelyn was a \u2018home girl\u2019, born in Engcobo in the Transkei in . Her\nfather, a mineworker, had died when she was an infant and her mother had died\nwhen she was twelve years old. She was sent to Johannesburg to attend\nsecondary school and placed in the care of an older brother who was living with\nthe Sisulus in Orlando. When the brother moved to a house in Orlando East, she\nwent with him, but she often returned to visit the Sisulus. She was a quiet, hardworking girl, much loved by them. On the half-day off that she had once a\nfortnight, her favourite treat was to spend it at the cinema watching Fu Manchu\nfilms.\nA few days after that first encounter, Mandela duly turned up at the hospital.\nThey began meeting regularly and soon fell in love. Neither of them discussed\npolitics. Within months Mandela proposed and Evelyn accepted. The Sisulus\nwere overjoyed. The couple were married in  at the Native Commissioner\u2019s\nCourt in Johannesburg, with Walter and Albertina as witnesses. There was no\nwedding feast, for they were too poor to afford one.\nTheir early life was happy but impoverished. Like many other African\ncouples, they found it impossible to find suitable accommodation. At first they\nwent to stay with Evelyn\u2019s brother in Orlando East, then with her sister and\nbrother-in-law at City Deep Mines. Early in , they were allocated their own\ntwo-room municipal house in Orlando East and finally, a year later, they moved\nto a three-room house, no. , in Orlando West. Identical to all the other\nhouses around it, which were lined up in one monotonous row after another, it\n\n\fstood on a small plot alongside a dirt road, with a tin roof, a cement floor, a\nnarrow kitchen and a bucket toilet at the back. There were streetlights outside,\nbut in the house paraffin lamps had to be used.\nThe house was soon full. Mandela\u2019s sister, Leabie, joined them from the\nTranskei to continue her education at Orlando High School. Later his mother\ncame to stay. There were always many visitors, especially from the Transkei.\nKaizer Matanzima, now employed as an articled clerk at a law firm in Umtata,\nregularly called. The Mandelas were always hospitable, making up beds on the\nfloor when too many arrived.\nTheir first child, a boy, was born in . He was named Madiba Thembekile\nbut known by his nickname, Thembi. Mandela was an attentive father, arriving\nat Bertrams Nursing Home loaded with clothes for Evelyn and the newborn\ninfant and ensuring that, when they returned to no. , a beautiful cot was\nready. At evening time, he enjoyed bathing Thembi, feeding him and putting\nhim to bed with a story. A daughter, Makaziwe, born in , was frail from\nbirth and died nine months later.\nMandela\u2019s domestic life was highly organised. He rose at dawn (a routine he\nfollowed all his life), went jogging, ate a light breakfast and occasionally took\nover the cooking. His home was a place where he enjoyed relaxing and reading.\nBut he was to spend less and less time there.\nCompleting his three years of articles at Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman in\nearly , Mandela decided to study full-time at university to gain an LLB\ndegree, which would enable him to practise on his own as an attorney. Without\nan income, the financial burden was crippling. He managed to obtain a loan of\n\u00a3 from the Bantu Welfare Trust at the South African Institute of Race\nRelations, but he was otherwise dependent on Evelyn\u2019s earnings as a nurse.\nThe work of the Congress Youth League, meanwhile, occupied him more and\nmore. \u2018We were never really young,\u2019 Oliver Tambo recalled. \u2018There were no\ndances, hardly a cinema, but meetings, discussions, every night, every weekend.\u2019\nThey were propelled all the more by outbreaks of popular discontent erupting\naround them, throwing up new movements and new leaders on the political\nterrain they wanted to capture for themselves.\n\nIn March , a mighty exodus began from the overcrowded quarters of\n\n\fOrlando, organised by an eccentric community leader named James Mpanza, a\nborn-again Christian who had spent thirteen years in prison having been\nconvicted of murdering an Indian trader. The first group he led consisted of a\nfew hundred families, living as subtenants in municipal housing in Orlando, who\nmoved on to open land belonging to the municipality between the community\nhall and the railway line, and built themselves shacks from sackcloth, cardboard,\nscrap metal and corrugated iron. Within weeks, \u2018Shantytown\u2019, as it became\nknown, had grown into a squatter camp of more than , people and at its\nheight reached , people, drawing in African families from other\novercrowded areas of Johannesburg and the Rand. Mpanza became their\nunofficial \u2018mayor\u2019. He liked to compare himself with Jesus Christ, proclaimed\nhimself King of Orlando and organised his camp into a movement called\nSofazonke, a Zulu word meaning \u2018We shall all die\u2019.\nOther squatter bosses followed suit, establishing camps on vacant land in the\nsame area in defiance of the municipal authorities. Like Mpanza, they levied rent\nand other charges on their followers, controlled trading activities and established\n\u2018police\u2019 and \u2018courts\u2019, developing autonomous enclaves and enriching themselves\nin the process. No whites could enter except under squatter escort. \u2018The\ngovernment is beaten,\u2019 said one squatter boss, Oriel Monongoaha. \u2018The\ngovernment was like a man who has a cornfield which is invaded by birds. He\nchases the birds from one part of the field and they alight in another part of the\nfield. . . . We squatters are the birds. The government sends its policemen to\nchase us away and we move off and occupy another spot. We shall see whether\nit is the farmer or the birds who get tired first.\u2019\nIt was in  that a maverick white Anglican priest, the Reverend Michael\nScott, entered this underworld to investigate conditions there at the request of a\ngroup of black ex-servicemen living in a squatter camp named Tobruk, just\nbelow Orlando West. Scott was known to Mandela. He had been an occasional\nvisitor to parties at Ismail Meer\u2019s flat in Kholvad House. An old-fashioned\ncrusader, he had arrived in South Africa from England in  to work as a\npriest at a Coloured orphanage near Sophiatown, soon taking up one cause after\nanother. The complaint of the ex-servicemen was about the corrupt regime of the\nsquatter boss who ran Tobruk, Samuel Komo, an ex-serviceman himself, who\nhad named his camp after the North African town where South African forces\nhad fought during the war.\nScott duly set up home in a tent amid a sea of shacks and hovels where ,\n\n\fsquatters were living. His headquarters became the Church of Christ, a\nCongregational outpost made of hessian sacks and wood, which served both as a\nchurch and a home for the Reverend Theophilus Dlamini and his family of\nseven. Their living quarters were separated from the church by a partition of\nsacking and wood. During divine service, the minister\u2019s wife could be heard\nbehind the ragged cloth at the back of the altar, alternately spanking, soothing\nand dressing her babies.\nScott and the Reverend Theophilus were soon drawn into an ugly conflict with\nKomo and his gangsters. The church\u2019s followers were intimidated into staying\naway; Scott was attacked and his tent torn down. Finally, armed with sticks and\nknives, Komo\u2019s men assaulted Theophilus and his children one night, ripped the\nsacking to pieces and burned the church to the ground. Scott, Theophilus, his\nwife and children sought refuge nearby at Mandela\u2019s small house in Orlando\nWest. Mandela remembered Scott as a modest, unassuming guest, but took a\ndislike to Theophilus, who complained about the food he served.\nOver a three-year period, some , Africans set up home in squatter camps\naround Johannesburg, surviving in squalor and hardship. So great were the\nnumbers that the municipal authorities abandoned all intention of prosecuting\nthem and launched instead emergency housing schemes, followed by a huge\nincrease in the construction of permanent housing. As the squatters were moved\nto new sites, officials used what they termed \u2018culling\u2019 measures against all who\nwere unemployed, sending them back to the reserves. The squatter movements\nwere eventually broken. Nevertheless, their actions had provoked government\nintervention. Years later, Mpanza was remembered in the neighbourhood as \u2018the\nman who founded Soweto\u2019. Though activists in the Congress Youth League\nrecognised the potential for gathering mass support over the squatter issue, their\nefforts to assist Mpanza were negligible. For all the brave talk about the need for\naction, they had yet to make a beginning. It was from other quarters, from the\nIndian community and the communists, that the action came.\n",
    "1946-1952": " FRIENDS AND COMRADES\nIN , SHORTLY AFTER THE SQUATTER EXODUS FROM ORLANDO\nHAD begun, two of Mandela\u2019s closest friends, Ismail Meer and Jaydew Singh,\njoined hundreds of other Indian volunteers who were protesting against new\nlegislation restricting Indian rights to land purchase and residence, resulting in\ntheir arrest and imprisonment. The protesters included doctors, lawyers,\nteachers, traders, students and even a seventeen-year-old schoolboy, Ahmed\nKathrada, who was to become another of Mandela\u2019s close friends. The\nlegislation, denounced by Indians as a \u2018Ghetto Act\u2019 for prohibiting them from\nowning property outside certain designated areas, had been introduced by the\ngovernment in response to an increasingly vociferous white clamour against\nIndian \u2018penetration\u2019 of white areas in Natal and the Transvaal. It was seen as a\ngeneral attack on the Indian community and provoked a campaign of passive\nresistance similar to ones that the Indian lawyer Mohandas Gandhi had\nsuccessfully used in South Africa forty years before. This tradition of civil\ndisobedience in defence of Indian rights was to have a significant influence on\nboth Mandela and the ANC.\nIndians had first arrived in Natal in the s to work as indentured labourers\nfor British sugar planters who were unable to secure sufficient labour from\namong local Africans. By , when their recruitment stopped, some ,\nIndian contract workers had made the journey, mostly low-caste Hindus from\nMadras and Calcutta, of whom about half stayed on in Natal after their terms of\nindenture had expired. Following in their wake came small groups of merchants\n\u2014\u2018passengers\u2019, as they were known\u2014travelling at their own expense, mainly\nMuslims from the state of Gujarat, who formed the basis of a prosperous\ncommercial elite. Most of the Indian community stayed in Natal, but several\nthousand found their way to the Transvaal. In Johannesburg, President Kruger\nset aside a \u2018Coolie Location\u2019 to the west of the town centre for Asian residents,\nbut they were also allowed to live in other areas there.\nWhen Gandhi first stepped ashore in Durban in , having been hired by a\n\n\fDurban-based Indian merchant company to assist in a law suit against an Indian\ntrader in the Transvaal, he expected no more than a single assignment. But he\nwas swiftly drawn into South Africa\u2019s racial vortex, remained for twenty-one\nyears and had a lasting effect on the Indian protest movement there.\nHe played a leading role in establishing the first permanent Indian political\norganisation, the Natal Indian Congress, in , and the Transvaal Indian\nCongress in . When the Transvaal government passed a law in  making\nit compulsory for Indians over the age of eight to carry passes bearing their\nfingerprints, Gandhi led the first passive resistance campaign in defence of\nIndian rights. At a mass meeting in the Empire Theatre in Johannesburg, where\nhe took the chair, some , representatives took an oath pledging to go to\nprison rather than apply for registration. The pass law was denounced as a\n\u2018Black Act\u2019 reducing them to the status of pass-bearing Africans. More than\n, Indians were eventually jailed or deported. Gandhi himself went to jail\nseveral times.\nOther campaigns were launched in protest against changes in the status of\nIndian married women and an Indian poll tax. Gandhi was never concerned with\nAfrican rights. Indeed, during an African rebellion in Zululand in , out of a\n\u2018genuine sense of loyalty to the British Empire\u2019, he volunteered to lead an Indian\nAmbulance Corps to help the authorities, just as six years before he had\nvolunteered his services in ambulance work to the British army during the\nAnglo-Boer War. Nevertheless, the successes that his passive resistance\ncampaigns achieved in getting pass laws and poll taxes rescinded were long\nremembered.\nConfronted with government proposals to restrict Indian property rights,\nIndian Congress leaders resolved to use Gandhi\u2019s old tactics to try to thwart the\nmove. Passive Resistance Councils were appointed in Natal and in the\nTransvaal. Mandela\u2019s student friend Jaydew Singh served as secretary of the\nTransvaal Passive Resistance Council, while Ismail Meer edited a weekly\njournal entitled Passive Resister.\nThe main centre of the campaign was Durban, where the large Indian\npopulation was the most seriously affected by the Ghetto Act. In June , the\nfirst group of protesters pitched tents on a vacant \u2018controlled\u2019 site at the corner of\nUmbilo Road and Gale Street. \u2018Resistance Camp\u2019, as it was known, quickly\nbecame the target for hostile white gangs, which pulled down the tents, set fire to\n\n\fthem and then began to assault the protesters. The protesters were instructed not\nto retaliate, no matter how brutal the assaults, even if women volunteers were\nattacked. Day after day, batches of protesters assembled to face renewed\nassaults. The crusading priest Michael Scott witnessed a night attack.\nSuddenly a whistle blew, and with shouts and catcalls the whole\nformation charged and bore down upon the little group of resisters who\nwere standing back-to-back so as to face in all directions. . . With their\nfists they struck the Indians in the face and about the body. No one\nretaliated but some tried to duck or ward off the blows before falling\ndown. On the ground they were kicked. Some were still, and some\ngroaning.\nThe protesters also faced arrest and imprisonment. Over the months, some\n, protesters, including  women, were arrested and imprisoned.\nVolunteers from Johannesburg, like Meer and Singh, travelled to Durban to play\ntheir part. Mandela watched with admiration as the protesters left Johannesburg.\nAmong them was Amina Pahad, whose flat in Orient House near Commissioner\nStreet he often visited for lunch. \u2018Suddenly, this charming woman put aside her\napron and went to jail for her beliefs,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018If I had once questioned the\nwillingness of the Indian community to protest against oppression, I no longer\ncould.\u2019\nThe campaign lasted until  but failed to move the government. The\nGhetto Act remained in force. But the efforts of the protesters were rewarded\nwhen their case was taken up by Pandit Nehru\u2019s provisional government in\nDelhi, which proposed that South Africa\u2019s treatment of its Indian population\nshould be placed on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. For the\nfirst time, the South African government found its racial policies under\ninternational attack.\n\nWithin weeks of the beginning of the Indian passive resistance campaign, an\neven more potent threat to white authority was launched by African\nmineworkers. The mineworkers\u2019 strike of  was the biggest labour protest in\nSouth Africa\u2019s history. What lay behind it were not just long-standing grievances\nabout pay and conditions but the influence of a dedicated group of communists\nwith the ability to mobilise workers. Once again, Mandela was left to watch on\nthe sidelines as friends and acquaintances threw themselves into action while the\n\n\fYouth League continued to ponder its ideological position.\nThe Communist Party in South Africa had a tortuous past. Formed in  by\na group consisting mainly of foreign-born British radicals and Eastern European\nJews, it found itself the following year supporting an insurrection by white\nmineworkers on the Witwatersrand determined to protect job segregation and\nblock all African competition. One of its banners, held aloft during a huge\ndemonstration of miners on the streets of Johannesburg, proclaimed: \u2018Workers\nof the World, Fight and Unite for a White South Africa.\u2019 The interests of white\nworkers rather than black workers remained its preoccupation for several years.\nAt a party congress in , one delegate complained about the activities of a\nprominent radical, Eddie Roux: \u2018Comrade Roux should not say at public\nmeetings in Johannesburg that natives should walk on the pavements etcetera.\nThat is what causes trouble at the meetings.\u2019\nIt was not until the late s that the party began to attract a significant\nAfrican membership. The night school it ran at its dingy office at a Fox Street,\nin the heart of the Ferreirastown slum in central Johannesburg, became a venue\nfor scores of African workers. Nearby rooms there were occupied by poor white\ndown-and-outs, prostitutes and methylated-spirit drinkers. Lessons were\nsometimes interrupted by loud stamping from the floor above or by drunkards\nforcing their way in. But the white volunteer teachers were enthusiastic and the\nstudents eager to learn the rudiments of reading, writing and arithmetic.\nOne of the workers who found his way to the night school soon rose to\nbecome a prominent figure in the hierarchy of both the Communist Party and the\nANC. Moses Kotane came from a devout Christian peasant family of Tswana\norigin from the Rustenburg district in the western Transvaal. Largely self-taught,\nwith little formal education, he became an insatiable reader and could often be\nfound in the back room of Mabuza\u2019s butchery on Market Street, where he could\nread in relative peace and quiet. He joined the ANC in  at the age of twentythree, but was disappointed by its ineffectiveness. The following year he joined\nthe Communist Party, where his abilities as a diligent and clear-thinking activist,\ncapable of mastering the most abstruse texts, were quickly recognised. In ,\nhe became a full-time functionary, unpaid but provided with food and sleeping\nquarters at the Fox Street office. The following year, he was sent off to study at\nthe Lenin School in Moscow.\nThe fortunes of the Communist Party had meanwhile slumped. The\n\n\fCommunist International, or Comintern, having paid scant attention to its South\nAfrican offspring since , decided abruptly in  that the true task of the\nparty in South Africa was to work for the establishment of an \u2018Independent\nNative Republic\u2019 as the first stage \u2018towards a workers\u2019 and peasants\u2019\ngovernment\u2019. Many white members saw this as racism in reverse and resigned.\nOthers were drawn into a protracted period of purges and internal strife. After\nfour years, most members had deserted; all that was left was a rump of \nfollowers, almost all of them white.\nOnly during the war years did the party\u2019s fortunes revive. Once the Soviet\nUnion had joined the war against Germany, communists emerged as enthusiastic\nsupporters of the war effort, organising a series of patriotic \u2018Defend South\nAfrica\u2019 rallies, which won them hundreds of new members. Speakers who had\npreviously denounced the war as an imperialist enterprise now urged their\naudiences to \u2018arm the people\u2019 and \u2018avenge Tobruk\u2019. Pro-Soviet organisations,\nlike the Friends of the Soviet Union and Medical Aid for Russia, gained\nwidespread public support, attracting as patrons respectable figures like the\nminister of justice, Dr Colin Steyn. Circulation of the pro-communist weekly\nnewspaper, The Guardian, reached ,. In the  general election, party\ncandidates failed to capture a seat but gained in all some , votes. The\nfollowing year, in municipal elections, a party member, Hilda Bernstein, became\nthe first and only communist candidate ever elected to public office by an allwhite electorate, winning the Hillbrow seat on the Johannesburg City Council.\nA new generation of communists came to the fore. Moses Kotane was chosen\nas the party\u2019s secretary-general and was to exercise a pragmatic influence over\nparty affairs in the years ahead. Also prominent was Edwin Mofutsanyana,\neditor of the party newspaper, Inkululeko, who took to patrolling Orlando\u2019s\ndusty streets in an air-raid warden\u2019s uniform.\nBut while the new membership of the Communist Party was predominantly\nAfrican, the leadership remained largely in white hands. White communists were\naccustomed to playing a leading role both as teachers of theory and as organisers\nin the field. Their financial and professional resources gave them inherent\nadvantages. Mostly they were middle-class activists brought up in an anti-fascist\ntradition at a time when battles with pro-Nazi groups on the steps of\nJohannesburg City Hall were a regular event. Many came from Jewish families,\ndescendants of immigrants from Lithuania and Latvia who had arrived in South\nAfrica in a huge influx between  and , escaping from political and\n\n\fracial persecution there as well as economic hardship, and who then faced in\nSouth Africa a rising tide of anti-Semitism among Afrikaner nationalists in the\ns and early s. The reality of white advantage was openly discussed.\nWriting in the party press in , Moses Kotane observed: \u2018In a party like ours,\nwhere whites and blacks come together, the general tendency of Non-European\nmembers is to take back seats and leave the leadership to the Europeans. They\nfeel themselves inferior to the European comrades. The reason for this is to be\nfound in the political, economic and social structure of South Africa.\u2019\nWhat the Communist Party had to offer, to aspiring blacks and Indians in\nparticular, was not just a sense of political purpose, its vision of a socialist\nfuture, but an avenue through the racial barriers that shaped South African\nsociety. It was the only political organisation in South Africa not to practise\nsome form of colour bar. It facilitated friendship across the colour line, giving\nmany people their first glimpse of a multiracial world. The social gatherings\norganised by the Communist Party, to which Nat Bregman introduced Mandela\nsoon after they first met, drew in a circle far wider than communist\nsympathisers. Personal contact between white and black was otherwise\nextremely rare. In the homes of white communists, Africans could sip brandy,\naway from the liquor laws and the threat of police raids, and enjoy a world of\nmusic, painting and discussion normally inaccessible to them.\nDespite such efforts, the Communist Party remained an elite group. Its slavish\ndevotion to the Soviet Union in party pronouncements lent weight to the belief\nthat its true allegiance lay there. Lacking mass support, it channelled its energies\nand abilities into supporting other organisations, seeking to extend its influence\nby such means. It paid considerable attention to the ailing ANC, where party\nofficials like Kotane served simultaneously in senior ANC posts. An anti-pass\ncampaign initiated by the communists during the war years was in danger of\ncollapse until Xuma agreed to join it. In the joint campaign that followed, there\nwas considerable friction when it appeared that the communists were not\nprepared to accept anything but token ANC leadership. The communists were\nfrequently impatient with the sluggish pace of ANC activity and dismissive of its\ncapacity to organise mass action. Moreover, their ultimate objectives differed.\nThe communists were intent not simply on fighting for African liberation from\nwhite rule, as the ANC was, but on leading South Africa in the direction of a\nsocialist republic. This placed them constantly at odds with African activists,\nwho feared they would try to take over the ANC for their own purposes.\n\n\fThe communists made the greatest impact in the field of trade union\norganisation, notably among African mineworkers. In their first attempt to\nestablish a mineworkers\u2019 union during the s, they encountered difficulties\nover organising migrant workers and consequently decided to enlist the support\nof the ANC. The initiative was taken by two prominent communists, Edwin\nMofutsanyana, who had trained at the Lenin School in Moscow, and Gaur\nRadebe; both held posts in the ANC. In , a steering committee to establish\nan African Mineworkers\u2019 Union was elected, headed by J. B. Marks, a former\nteacher born in  of mixed parentage in Ventersdorp in the western\nTransvaal. Like Kotane and Mofutsanyana, he had joined the Communist Party\nin the late s, as well as the ANC, studied at the Lenin School in Moscow in\nthe s and returned to South Africa to become a full-time party and trade\nunion organiser.\nThe task they faced was formidable. African miners on the Witwatersrand\nwere rural men with strong tribal allegiances, serving out their contracts in mine\ncompounds, separated from the rest of the black community until they returned\nhome. Their only alternative to compound life was the cheap canteens and\nshabby concession stores adjacent to the compounds. They were men who\nunderstood little of city life or modern politics, whose primary aim was to earn\nmoney for their families back home. The compounds, moreover, were closed to\nunion officials. Meetings could be held only clandestinely. Organisers faced\ndismissal and deportation to rural areas. One of Mandela\u2019s tasks as a mine\npoliceman, if he had stayed at Crown Mines, would have been to keep a sharp\neye out for such activists.\nFrom the outset, the African Mineworkers\u2019 Union pressed wage demands on\nthe Chamber of Mines but received no hearing. In , miners\u2019 discontent\nspilled over into sporadic strikes at individual mines. Seeking to avoid further\ntrouble during wartime, the government appointed a commission of inquiry into\nthe wages and conditions of African miners, giving the Mineworkers\u2019 Union the\nopportunity to organise meetings up and down the Reef to collect and formulate\nworkers\u2019 grievances. The commission recommended substantial improvements.\nBut three years later wages in the mines were less than half the minimum\namount advocated by the commission, and employers ignored further demands\nfrom mineworkers. Sporadic trouble broke out. At Crown Mines, , miners\nwent on hunger strike.\nAt a union meeting on  August , held in public at the New-town Market\n\n\fSquare, west of Johannesburg\u2019s city centre, delegates numbering more than\n, voted to call a strike of all Africans employed in the gold mines, starting\non  August. No previous attempt had been made to organise an industry-wide\nstrike. The union president, J. B. Marks, warned them of the risk of repression.\n\u2018You are challenging the basis of the cheap labour system,\u2019 he said, \u2018and must be\nready to sacrifice in the struggle.\u2019\nThe strike brought Mandela into close touch with Marks, beginning another\nimportant friendship. Mandela had several relatives working in the mines and\nvisited them during the strike to express support, sometimes in the company of\nMarks on his own rounds. He was impressed by his \u2018cool and reasoned\nleadership\u2019 at the height of crisis.\nWith forty-five mines strung out along fifty miles of the Witwatersrand, often\nin isolated areas surrounded by unused scrubland and constantly patrolled by\nmine police, the strike call far outstretched the capacity of union organisers. To\nbolster the strike, Johannesburg\u2019s close-knit communists mobilised all their\nresources, providing teams of volunteers, cars, typewriters, duplicators and\nleaflet-writers. The party\u2019s district committee met secretly at different venues\nboth by day and by night, directing its members\u2019 work. Leaflets were printed and\ndistributed from end to end of the Witwatersrand. Flying squads of communist\nactivists rushed from mine to mine to back up the efforts of the union. A strike\nbulletin was compiled each evening by Rusty Bernstein, a skilful writer in\ncharge of party propaganda, and dispatched at night to mine compounds by\nvolunteers, sometimes dressed to look like miners.\nThe strike lasted for five days, drawing in some , miners, about a\nquarter of the African labour force. Nine mines came to a standstill and\nproduction at ten others was disrupted. An increasingly ugly struggle developed\nbetween militant miners and police called in to break the strikes, resulting in the\ndeath of twelve miners and injuries to more than , others. On  August, the\nRand Daily Mail reported how a force of  policemen sent , feet\nunderground at the Nigel gold mine to deal with , miners staging a sit-down\nstrike \u2018drove the natives up, stope by stope, level by level, until they reached the\nsurface\u2019.\nPolice also raided the union\u2019s office in Johannesburg and the Communist\nParty\u2019s district office in Commissioner Street, removing case-loads of\ndocuments. Determined to show that it could deal with \u2018the red menace\u2019, the\n\n\fgovernment then ordered the arrest of the entire Johannesburg district committee\nand other strike organisers, a total of fifty-two people, on charges of conspiracy\nto commit sedition. These were later reduced to a charge of assisting a strike\nwhich was illegal in terms of war measures still in force. All the accused pleaded\nguilty, including Yusuf Dadoo, the communist Indian leader who had been in\nprison throughout the period serving a sentence for his actions in the passive\nresistance campaign, and the Afrikaner lawyer Bram Fischer, a district\ncommittee member who had been on holiday in a wildlife reserve throughout the\nstrike. In terms of the objectives that the miners set, the strike was a complete\nfailure. None of their demands was met and their union was virtually destroyed.\nThe communists too now found themselves the target of harassment. Members\nof the party\u2019s central committee were charged anew with sedition. The evidence\nwas flimsy, but the proceedings dragged on for two years. The popular support\nthat the communists had enjoyed during the war evaporated. The more timid or\nprudent members retired from the fray, leaving behind a committed hardcore.\nNevertheless, the strike produced a considerable shift in the political terrain.\nTwo days after the strike started, members of the Native Representative Council,\nthe advisory body established by the government as compensation for the loss of\nthe African franchise in , assembled in Pretoria for their annual sitting in an\nangry and defiant mood, appalled by the government\u2019s treatment of the\nmineworkers. Although the council possessed no executive power, it had\nattracted some of the most able and respected Africans in the country, including\nMandela\u2019 s teacher from Fort Hare, Professor Matthews, an eminent physician,\nDr James Moroka, and a distinguished Zulu chief, Albert Luthuli, all of whom\nwere moderate men. During the war years they had become increasingly critical\nof the government\u2019s failure to take their views seriously. Now reports of police\nbrutality against the miners sent them to the brink of rebellion. Their tempers\nwere not improved when they discovered that, on the instructions of the Pretoria\nCity Council, they had been barred from premises they normally used in the\nPretoria City Hall and instead given cramped quarters in the Department of\nLabour, where the lavatories were for whites only. They also found, much to\ntheir irritation, that the council\u2019s chairman, the Secretary of the Native Affairs\nDepartment, had been called away to Johannesburg on strike business and that\nhis place had been taken by a deputy. When the deputy made no mention in his\nopening address of the miners\u2019 strike or police action, the councillors reacted\nwith vigour. Paul Mosaka, a successful Johannesburg businessman, referred to\nthe \u2018wanton shooting\u2019 of miners and went on to launch a blistering attack on the\n\n\fgovernment\u2019s neglect of the council\u2019s work. \u2018We have been fooled,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018We have been asked to cooperate with a toy telephone.\u2019\nThe following day, the council unanimously passed a resolution which\ncondemned government policy, called for the abolition of all discriminatory\nlegislation and announced that the session would be adjourned. Even\ngovernment-appointed chiefs voted in favour of the motion. At the end of the\ndebate, a veteran nationalist figure, Selope Thema, turned to the council\nchairman and warned, \u2018It may not happen in your day, but it may come about\nthat the black people will stand together against the white people.\u2019\nThe old style of African politics, of polite requests and suggestions, had\nfinally reached the end of the road. In its place came a growing interest in\ncollaboration between different groups of the government\u2019s opponents. To\nMandela and to others in the Youth League, this was an unwelcome\ndevelopment.\n\nMandela\u2019s circle of friends and acquaintances in Johannesburg was unusually\nwide and varied. He established strong friendships with white, black and Indian\nalike. He enjoyed calling at the International Club in Kort Street, where political\nradicals of every hue gathered for coffee, social events and lectures. He was as\nmuch at ease in the homes of white radicals like Michael Harmel, a leading\ncommunist theoretician and writer, as in the homes of black radicals. He\ndeveloped a liking for Indian cooking and was a welcome guest in many Indian\nhomes. His favourite base in town was Ismail Meer\u2019s flat in Kholvad House,\nwhere endless discussions and arguments took place and where parties on\nSaturday nights, with dancing, illicit drink and a selection of curry meals, would\ngo on until the early hours of Sunday mornings. When it was too late to catch the\nlast train for Orlando, Mandela would stay there overnight.\nIn his political outlook, however, Mandela identified himself with the extreme\nwing of the Congress Youth League, which was hostile to all suggestion of\ncollaboration with white, Indian or communist groups. As a true disciple of\nLembede, he was adamant about the need for African leadership and African\ncontrol. Lembede\u2019s Africanism was essentially a philosophy of racial\nexclusivity. In an early draft of the Youth League\u2019s statement of policy, whites\nwere described as \u2018foreigners\u2019. The slogans favoured by the more extreme\nAfricanists included \u2018Africa for the Africans\u2019 and \u2018Hurl the White man to the\n\n\fsea\u2019, which they tried to get the ANC\u2019s annual conference in Bloemfontein to\naccept in . Mandela was sympathetic to their views: \u2018While I was not\nprepared to hurl the white man into the sea, I would have been perfectly happy if\nhe had climbed aboard his steamships and left the continent of his own volition.\u2019\nAbove all, Mandela was anti-communist, convinced that the communists were\nintent on trying to take over the African nationalist movement for their own\npurposes. The prominent role that white members played in the party and the\nemphasis that communists placed on class struggle rather than racial oppression\nall served to confirm his distrust. In , in an overt attempt to rid the ANC of\nCommunist Party members, Lembede, Sisulu, Tambo and Mandela put forward\na motion to the ANC\u2019s Transvaal branch proposing that members with dual\nallegiance to other organisations should be expelled from the ANC.\nTowards Indian political activists Mandela was only marginally less hostile,\nfearing that, with their superior education and training, Indians would dominate\nAfrican initiatives as surely as white communists wanted to. Their interests,\nmoreover, did not coincide with African interests. Africans were preoccupied\nwith issues like pass laws, which did not affect Indians, whereas Indians were\npitted against measures like the Ghetto Act, which did not directly affect\nAfricans. The final verdict reached by the Youth League was that Indians would\nnot be regarded as \u2018intruders or enemies\u2019 provided that they did not undermine\nthe African struggle for liberation.\nFor month after month, members of the Youth League argued over these\nissues, meeting sometimes in Sisulu\u2019s office off Market Street, sometimes in\nLembede\u2019s office close by, or in each other\u2019s homes in Orlando. The core of the\ngroup consisted of no more than sixty Africans, with a far smaller number\nplaying an active part in debates. They were preoccupied principally with\nestablishing ideological positions, with constructing a \u2018nation-building\u2019\nideology, rather than planning political action, but they were not short of views\non other matters. When King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and the two royal\nprincesses toured South Africa in , the Youth League executive met in\nMandela\u2019s house in Orlando to consider the question of a boycott. Lembede\nargued passionately against paying homage to the head of a state that had failed\nto honour its moral duty to the African people. Mandela, more respectful of\nroyalty than others, cautioned against taking an emotional view, pointing out that\nthe British monarchy was a great and enduring institution; but he was not\nopposed to a boycott. The Youth League\u2019s subsequent call for a boycott, in\n\n\fprotest against the \u2018barbarous policy of the Union Government maintained in the\nname of His Majesty\u2019, infuriated the ANC leader, Dr Xuma.\nThe main body of the ANC was meanwhile moving in a different direction,\nseeking new links with other opposition groups. The Africanist attempt at the\n annual conference to gain approval for the slogan \u2018Africa for the Africans\nand the White Man for the Sea\u2019 was rejected as being \u2018not in accordance with\nthe Congress spirit\u2019. Xuma was also receptive to communist approaches to\ncollaborate, taking part in a communist-organised anti-pass campaign during the\nwar years. In , three veteran communists, Marks, Kotane and Daniel\nTloome, were elected to the ANC\u2019s national executive committee. Communists\nwithin the ANC became articulate critics of the exclusivist position that the\nAfricanists advocated. Attempts by the Youth League to exclude communists\nfrom ANC membership, which gained significant support in the Transvaal ANC,\nfailed at a national level.\nCooperation with Indian organisations was also strengthened. In the wake of\nthe Indian passive resistance campaign, the ANC found common cause with the\nTransvaal Indian Congress and the Natal Indian Congress in opposing\ndiscriminatory legislation. In March , all three organisations signed a pact\ncommitting them to work together for full franchise rights and the removal of all\nforms of racial discrimination. One of the first projects they launched was a\n\u2018Votes for All\u2019 campaign, demanding the extension of the franchise to all South\nAfricans.\nIt was over the \u2018Votes for All\u2019 issue that Mandela and Sisulu came into sharp\ndisagreement. Sisulu had begun to take a more pragmatic view of opposition to\nthe government. Once a committed member of the Africanist group, as hostile to\ncooperation with whites, Indians and communists as Lembede, he had come to\naccept the need for a wider approach if opposition was to succeed. However\nappealing Lembede\u2019s Africanism was at an emotional level, from a strategic\npoint of view it had obvious limitations. Joint campaigns were a practical way\nforward.\nMandela, however, along with Oliver Tambo, insisted on the need for African\nleadership of any campaign involving other groups. At a rowdy meeting of the\nTransvaal ANC called to debate the \u2018Votes for All\u2019 issue, their disagreement\nburst out into the open. The meeting broke up in disorder. \u2018Nelson and Oliver\nwere so angry with me that instead of going to the station together to take the\n\n\ftrain home, as we usually did, we went separate ways,\u2019 recalled Sisulu.\nWhat shifted the balance within the Youth League further in the direction of a\nmore moderate stance was the sudden death of Lembede, at the age of thirtythree, in July . Mandela had been visiting Lembede at his office during a\nlunch break when Lembede complained of a pain in his stomach. When the pain\ngrew worse, Lembede was taken to Coronation Hospital, but he died that\nevening. The Youth League was stunned. Lembede\u2019s forceful personality had\nguided it from the beginning; his ideas on Africanism had become its own creed.\nHowever, his obsession with sticking rigidly to Africanist ideals, fending off\ncritics from all sides, had become an obstacle to its advancement.\nHis successor, Peter Mda, an Orlando teacher with a sharper, more analytical\napproach, began to move the Youth League away from the extreme positions\nfavoured by Lembede. In place of the term \u2018Africanism\u2019, Mda preferred to use\n\u2018African Nationalism\u2019. When the Youth League finally published its \u2018Basic\nPolicy\u2019 in , four years after its formation, Mda was its author.\nIt must be noted that there are two streams of African Nationalism. One\ncentres round Marcus Garvey\u2019s slogan \u2018Africa for Africans\u2019. It is based\non the \u2018Quit Africa\u2019 slogan and the cry \u2018Hurl the Whiteman into the sea\u2019.\nThis brand of African nationalism is extreme and ultra-revolutionary.\nThere is another stream of African Nationalism (Africanism) which is\nmoderate, and which the Congress Youth League professes. We of the\nYouth League take account of the concrete situation in South Africa, and\nrealize that the different racial groups have come to stay. But we insist\nthat a condition for interracial peace and progress is the abandonment of\nwhite domination, and such a change in the basic structure of South\nAfrican society that those relations which breed exploitation and human\nmisery will disappear.\nDue warnings were given about \u2018the need for vigilance against communists\nand other groups which foster non-African interests . . . groups that seek to\nimpose on our struggle cut-and-dried formulas, which so far from clarifying the\nissues of our struggle, only serve to obscure the fundamental fact that we are\noppressed not as a class, but as a people\u2019. The help of white liberals was\ndismissed as being worthless: \u2018Their voice is negligible, and in the last analysis\ncounts for nothing. In their struggle for freedom the Africans will be wasting\ntheir time and deflecting their forces if they look up to the Europeans either for\n\n\finspiration or for help.\u2019 Indian organisations were given similarly short shrift.\nWhat the Youth League essentially wanted was to \u2018go it alone\u2019. But the extent to\nwhich other groups were to be excluded from the African struggle for power was\nan issue that was left unresolved. Two rival schools of thought developed: the\nAfricanist school, which put African interests above all others, and the\nNationalist school, which preferred a more flexible approach towards other\ngroups. This division in African opinion was to be the cause of bitter clashes for\nyears to come.\nMandela remained firmly in the Africanist camp. Yet though he was spending\nmore and more time on political activity, neglecting both his law studies at the\nUniversity of the Witwatersrand and his family in Orlando, he possessed no\nclear sense of direction. As a political activist in the s, he made no\nparticular impact. He had a reputation, as he admitted, as \u2018a gadfly\u2019, knowing\nwhat he was against rather than what he was for. Whereas Sisulu was developing\na strategic outlook about the African struggle for political rights, using the\n\u2018Votes for All\u2019 campaign as a means to strengthen links with other opposition\ngroups, Mandela was more concerned about tactical issues, worried that the\nANC might not gain the credit for the campaign rather than whether the\ncampaign achieved any success. Sisulu, often quiet amid fierce debate going on\naround him, listened carefully to arguments by veteran communists like Marks\nand Kotane about the need for collaboration; Mandela, relishing fierce argument,\nwas not so amenable. He was also prone to occasional hotheaded action. Oliver\nTambo, in later years, remembered him as \u2018passionate, emotional, sensitive,\nquickly stung to bitterness and retaliation by insult and patronage\u2019. Sisulu,\nrecalling their dispute over the \u2018Votes for All\u2019 issue, reflected on the moments of\nanger that Mandela sometimes showed: \u2018Essentially, he is a moderate,\nreasonable man in his approach. That is his general nature. But then there is this\ncontradiction of stubbornness. When it comes to the final point, he can become\nvery stubborn, very arrogant. His anger becomes extreme. It is not in argument\nthat he becomes angry. It is when he suspects people\u2019s motives\u2014as he did with\nthe communists.\u2019\nSo engrossed were members of the Youth League with their own internal\ndebates and meetings that they paid scant attention to political developments in\nthe white community. Nor did they think they were important. It therefore came\nas a shock to Mandela when, at dawn one day in the streets of Johannesburg, he\nemerged with Oliver Tambo from an all-night meeting to find newspapers\n\n\fproclaiming that Afrikaner nationalists had taken power in the  election.\n THE APARTHEID MACHINE\nFOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS, SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE\nUNION in , South Africa had been led by Afrikaner generals\u2014Botha,\nHertzog and Smuts\u2014who had fought courageously against the might of the\nBritish army in the Anglo-Boer War, but whose main preoccupation in office\nhad been to ensure a stable balance between the Boers and the British that would\nunderpin the Union.\nThe task had not been an easy one. The Anglo-Boer War had left a legacy of\nbitterness among the Boers that endured for generations. Faced with guerrilla\nwarfare for which they were ill-prepared, British military commanders devised a\nscorched-earth strategy in which Boer villages were razed to the ground,\nthousands of Boer farmsteads destroyed and cattle and sheep slaughtered or\ncarried away on such a scale that by the end of the war the Boers of the Orange\nFree State had lost half of their herds and those in the Transvaal, three-quarters.\nCaptured burghers were deported overseas in their thousands. Women and\nchildren were rounded up and placed in what the British called concentration\ncamps, where conditions were so appalling that some , died there from\ndisease and malnutrition, most of them under the age of sixteen.\nIn the aftermath of the war, the British authorities made every effort to reestablish Boer farmers on the land and to resuscitate the shattered economy of\ntheir new colonies. Yet the war had destroyed much that reconstruction could\nnever replace, reducing a large part of the Boer community to an impoverished\nrural people. A growing number drifted to the towns, hoping to find work. But\nthe towns were the citadels of British commerce and culture, where Boers from\nthe platteland, possessing no skills or education, found themselves scorned and\ndespised for their poverty, their country ways and their language. Many were\nforced to live cheek by jowl with Africans in slums on the ragged edges of\ntowns, like the western areas of Johannesburg, and seek work in competition\nwith cheap black labour. Urban poverty became as common as rural poverty.\n\n\fEven though the Union was launched in  with much goodwill on all\nsides, with General Botha as prime minister and General Smuts and General\nHertzog as members of the cabinet, fear and resentment of British domination\nran deep. Many Afrikaners never accepted the idea of being part of the British\nEmpire and mourned the loss of their own republics. Everywhere they were\nreminded of the presence of British authority. \u2018God Save the King\u2019 became the\nofficial anthem. The national flag was a British Red Ensign, with the Union coat\nof arms in a lower corner. Most civil servants were English-speaking. The\nBritish dominated industry, commerce and the mines and controlled banks and\nfinance houses. They also held an almost complete monopoly of industrial skills\nand training. Moreover, under the  constitution, on questions of war and\npeace South Africa was not a sovereign independent state but was bound by\ndecisions of the British government. When General Botha took South Africa into\nthe  war with Germany, a group of his old Boer War comrades rose in\nrebellion.\nGeneral Hertzog was prominent among those Afrikaners who feared that the\nsheer weight of British influence would eventually engulf the Afrikaner people.\nDropped from the cabinet in , he formed the National Party in ,\nproposing a \u2018two-stream\u2019 policy for South Africans by which Afrikaners and\nEnglish would develop separately their own culture and traditions until the\nAfrikaner stream attained an equal status with the English. As prime minister\nfrom , Hertzog achieved many of his goals. South Africa was recognised by\nBritain as a sovereign independent state and given Dominion status. A new\nnational flag was approved. Afrikaans, a vernacular derived from a mixture of\nDutch, Malay, Portuguese creole and Khoisan speech, became an official\nlanguage for the first time.\nBut the problem of white poverty continued to grow. In the depression years\nof -, the scale of misery affecting poor whites was immense. A Carnegie\nCommission report estimated that in  nearly half of the white population\nwas living in \u2018dire poverty\u2019. At least nine out of ten of these poor-white families\nwere said to be Afrikaans-speaking. In rural areas, the commission reported,\nmany families were living in hovels woven from reeds or in mud huts with\nthatched roofs similar to those used by Africans. One third of these dwellings\nwere said to be \u2018unsuitable for civilized life\u2019. Many white families lived a\nnarrow and backward existence. More than half of the children did not complete\nprimary education: \u2018Education was largely looked upon, among the rural\n\n\fpopulation, as something foreign, as a thing that had no bearing on their daily\nlife and needs.\u2019\nIn an attempt to deal with the problems of poor-white unemployment, Hertzog\ndevised what was known as a \u2018civilized labour\u2019 policy. In practice this meant\nthat, wherever feasible, whites replaced black workers in the public service and\nstate-owned corporations like the railways. Such measures, however, were not\nsufficient to keep pace with the flood of rural immigrants seeking work in towns.\nStruggling to cope with the consequences of depression, Hertzog agreed in \nto take his National Party into a coalition with Smuts\u2019s opposition South Africa\nParty in what became known as Fusion government. The following year, the two\nparties merged as the United Party.\nIt was out of this maelstrom of misery and hardship that a new form of\nAfrikaner nationalism emerged. It was not simply a return to the old nationalism\nof the past, of the kind once espoused by Hertzog, aiming to defend Afrikaner\ntraditions and interests. This was a new nationalism, hardened by new ideology\nand driven by a ruthless determination to achieve Afrikaner domination. In place\nof the idea of Suid Afrikaanse volkseenheid, a unity between all South Africa\u2019s\nwhites, which Hertzog now advocated, the new nationalists wanted Afrikaner\nvolkseenheid. In the context of the s, the greatest threat to Afrikanerdom\nwas seen to come not from the blacks, as it was at a later stage, but from British\nimperialism and its allies in the English-speaking population. All the ills facing\nthe Afrikaner people were attributed to the evil designs of British policy,\nstretching back to the early nineteenth century, when Britain gained control of\nthe Cape and imposed its rule over the Boer inhabitants.\nPowerful myths, myths that endured for generations, were used by nationalist\npoliticians and intellectuals to gain popular support. Afrikaners were portrayed\nas members of an exclusive volk created by the hand of God to fulfill a special\nmission in South Africa. Their history, their language, their culture, being\ndivinely ordained, were unique. They were an organic unity from which \u2018foreign\nelements\u2019 like English-speakers were excluded. This vision of the Afrikaners as\na chosen people, based on Calvinist ideas, had first been expounded by Paul\nKruger, president of the Transvaal republic. Now it became a central part of the\nnationalist creed. At its core, the new nationalism\u2014Christian Nationalism, as it\nwas called\u2014was essentially a potent mix of the Old Testament and modern\npolitics.\n\n\fThe driving force behind the nationalist revival was a secret, tightly\ndisciplined Afrikaner organisation called the Broederbond, which by the mids had extended its influence to every level of Afrikaner society. Its elite\nmembership, carefully selected and bound together by oath, comprised mainly\nprofessional men\u2014teachers, academics, clergymen and civil servants\u2014many of\nthem based in urban areas of the Transvaal. Their objective was made clear by\nthe chairman of the Broederbond, Professor van Rooy, in a private circular\nissued in : \u2018Let us keep constantly in view the fact that our chief concern is\nwhether Afrikanerdom will reach its eventual goal of mastery [baaskap] in\nSouth Africa. Brothers, our solution for South Africa\u2019s troubles is . . . that the\nAfrikaner Broederbond shall rule South Africa.\u2019\nWhen Hertzog agreed to enter the Fusion government and merge the National\nParty into the new United Party, Afrikaner nationalists led by Dr Daniel Malan,\na Dutch Reformed Church predikant who had forsaken the pulpit for politics,\nlaunched a \u2018purified\u2019 National Party, claiming to stand for the aims and\nobjectives of \u2018true\u2019 Afrikaners, whom, they said, Hertzog had betrayed. The\nimpact they initially made was limited. For several years, Malan\u2019s Nationalists\nremained in the wilderness. Hertzog dismissed them as a group of fanatics\nmerely intent on stirring up discord and hatred.\nWhat provided Malan with a breakthrough was the fierce dissension among\nAfrikaners that erupted at the outbreak of the Second World War. Hertzog\ninsisted that South Africa should remain neutral, arguing that the war was none\nof its concern. Smuts, a great admirer of Britain and the Empire and a close\nfriend of Winston Churchill, was adamant that South Africa should stand side by\nside with Britain. The Fusion government, meeting on  September , was\nsplit: seven ministers wanted an immediate declaration of war against Germany\nand six opposed them. The issue went to parliament two days later. By a vote of\neighty to sixty-seven, Smuts took South Africa into the war. Hertzog resigned\nand with his supporters threw in his lot with Malan.\nA large part of Afrikanerdom was outraged that South Africa had once again\nbeen dragged into another of \u2018England\u2019s wars\u2019. Overnight, Afrikaner\nrepublicanism became a potent political force. As Hitler\u2019s armies advanced\nacross Europe, the surge of pro-German sentiment grew stronger. Nationalist\nnewspapers cheered each Allied setback. Paramilitary groups supporting Hitler\nattracted hundreds of thousands of followers. An elite paramilitary corps\u2014\nStormjaers\u2014was formed to sabotage the war effort. Attacks were made on\n\n\frailways, power lines and public buildings. The government retaliated by\ninterning thousands of pro-Nazi activists, among them several Nationalist figures\nwho were later to achieve high office. As the tide of war turned against\nGermany, the heady atmosphere created by early German successes soon\ndissipated. But the overall effect was to leave Malan\u2019s National Party as the\nmain focal point for Afrikaner aspirations.\nIt was during the war years that Nationalist politicians and intellectuals began\nto pay increasing attention to \u2018the Native problem\u2019. The wartime economic boom\nhad drawn massive numbers of Africans into urban areas. More than half a\nmillion were added to the urban African population between  and ,\nmostly during the war years. In urban areas, blacks outnumbered whites. On a\nnational basis, as the  census figures showed, the whites were a declining\nproportion of the population. Since  the white population had increased by\nlittle more than a million to . million, whereas the non-white population had\nexpanded by nearly . million to  million. About  per cent of Africans were\nliving in white-designated areas, either in towns or on farms, while only  per\ncent were based in the reserves. By sheer weight of numbers, it seemed to the\nNationalists, Africans threatened to swamp the white population. As the problem\nof white poverty receded, this new threat\u2014swart gevaar, the black peril\u2014\nbecame their abiding obsession.\nAs prime minister, Smuts too was obliged to take a closer interest in the mood\nof militancy spreading among the African population. He had never previously\npaid much attention to \u2018the Native problem\u2019, preferring to leave it in the hands of\nthe Native Affairs Department. But determined to avoid possible disruption to\nthe war effort, he appointed a commission early in  to investigate the socioeconomic, educational and health conditions of urban Africans. The commission\npointed out, as previous commissions had done, that a Native policy based\nessentially on the development of the reserves was an illusion; a large and\npermanent African urban population was an unavoidable part of South Africa\u2019s\nfuture. It recommended in particular the abolition of the pass laws, which by\nthen involved the arrest of , Africans each year: \u2018The harassing and\nconstant interference with the freedom of movement of Natives gives rise to a\nburning sense of grievance and injustice which has an unsettling effect on the\nNative population as a whole.\u2019\nSmuts himself spoke eloquently on the matter in : \u2018A revolutionary\nchange is taking place among the Native peoples of Africa through the\n\n\fmovement from the country to the towns\u2014the movement from the old Reserves\nin the Native areas to the big European centres of population. Segregation tried\nto stop it. It has, however, not stopped it in the least. The process has been\naccelerated. You might as well try to sweep the ocean back with a broom.\u2019\nYet though Smuts occasionally expressed liberal sentiments about African\nrights, he never fulfilled them. His conviction about the virtues of European\ncivilisation and government ran too deep. Nor was he able to provide any clear\nanswers to the Native question, believing that for the foreseeable future it was\ninsoluble. He merely hoped, though without much confidence, that in time there\nmight be an improvement in race relations. The impression he gave to an\nincreasingly worried electorate was that his government was beginning to lose\ncontrol of the black population and, what was worse, lacked the will to restore\ncontrol.\nMalan\u2019s Nationalists, meanwhile, put forward a plan which they claimed\nwould provide a permanent solution to the Native problem: apartheid. The word\nhad come into common use in the mid-s among a group of Afrikaner\nintellectuals searching for decisive methods of dealing with the African\npopulation. During the war years, Malan began to mention it in speeches in\npublic, but it remained a vague concept. Then, in post-war years, Nationalist\nintellectuals and theologians defined it more closely.\nApartheid essentially was a simple doctrine. It involved the idea of total racial\nseparation. Every facet of life\u2014residence, amenities, transport, education and\npolitics\u2014would be kept separate, wherever possible. This policy would apply to\nColoured and Indian people as well as to the African population. By such means\nno race group would then threaten any longer the future of any other. The\nsurvival of the white race would be assured. The blacks, meanwhile, would be\nable to preserve their own culture and identity and to develop in their own areas.\nAll this, the Nationalists asserted, was in accordance with Christian principles of\nright and justice. God had ordained the division of nations and wished them to\nbe kept separate. Texts from the Bible were cited as proof.\nThese ideas were incorporated into a political manifesto drawn up by a\nNational Party commission under Paul Sauer and issued in , a few months\nbefore the general election. The reserves, said the Sauer report, were the proper\nhomelands of the African population. There they would be allowed to develop to\ntheir full capacities. Urban Africans, meanwhile, would be treated as \u2018visitors\u2019\n\n\fand strictly controlled.\nNatives in the urban areas should be regarded as migratory citizens not\nentitled to political and social rights equal to those of whites. The process\nof detribalization should be arrested. The entire migration of Natives into\nand from the cities should be controlled by the state, which will enlist the\ncooperation of municipal bodies. Migration into and from the Reserves\nshall likewise be strictly controlled. Surplus Natives in the urban areas\nshould be returned to their original habitat in the country areas [white\nfarms] or the Reserves. Natives from the country areas shall be admitted\nto the urban areas or towns as temporary employees obliged to return to\ntheir homes after the expiry of their employment.\nSmuts was thought to be in no particular danger from the Nationalist\nchallenge. With the Allied victory in , his prestige had reached new heights.\nAbroad, he was hailed as an international statesman, admired by leaders like\nChurchill and Roosevelt and entrusted with the task of drafting the Preamble to\nthe United Nations Charter, earning widespread applause for the emphasis he\nplaced on fundamental rights. On his return home from the United Nations\nconference in San Francisco in , he was given a tumultuous welcome. His\nviews about the importance of European rule were common enough at the time,\nnot only in South Africa but throughout the African continent and in the capitals\nof Europe, from where most of Africa was then ruled. Although South Africa\u2019s\nracial practices were beginning to attract adverse international attention, they\ntended to differ in detail rather than in essence from the discriminatory policies\nemployed elsewhere in Africa under colonial rule. The platform he put forward\nin the election was pragmatic. He endorsed a government report which argued\nthat the urbanisation of the African could not be reversed and that henceforth\nblacks should be accepted as a permanent part of the urban population. Although\nsome controls over the movement of blacks to the cities were still needed, the\nsystem of migrant labour had become obsolete and wasteful and the idea of\nterritorial separation of the races was \u2018utterly impractical\u2019.\nNot even the Nationalists believed that victory in the  election was within\ntheir reach. Their hopes were based on the following election. The ruling United\nParty, together with its parliamentary allies, went into the election with a\nmajority of more than fifty seats. For the Nationalists to win would require a\nswing of opinion among the electorate unprecedented in the Union\u2019s history.\nYet, with relentless propaganda, the Nationalists ensured that the swart gevaar\n\n\fissue dominated public debate, using every opportunity to play on the\nelectorate\u2019s racial anxieties. The choice for whites, the Nationalists said, was\nbetween \u2018integration and national suicide\u2019 on the one hand and \u2018apartheid\u2019 and\nthe protection of a \u2018pure white race\u2019 on the other. The  election, said Malan,\nwould be the most decisive in South Africa\u2019s history. One question\novershadowed all others: \u2018Will the European race in the future be able to\nmaintain its rule, its purity, its civilization; or will it float until it vanishes for\never, without honour, in the black sea of South Africa\u2019s Non-European\npopulation?\u2019 Only a National Party government, he said, could provide an\neffective answer. It would outlaw interracial marriage, control African influx\ninto the cities, protect white workers from African competition and segregate\nwhites and blacks to the maximum extent possible. It would also outlaw the\ncommunists and deal effectively with the Indian population. \u2018Indians are a\nforeign and outlandish element which is unassimilable, \u2019 said Malan. \u2018They can\nnever become part of the country, and must therefore be treated as an immigrant\ncommunity.\u2019 He would call a halt to immigration and begin repatriation. Two\ncrude slogans used by the National Party summed it all up: \u2018Die kaffir op sy\nplek\u2019\u2014\u2018The kaffir in his place\u2019\u2014and \u2018Die koolies uit die land\u2019\u2014\u2018The coolies\nout of the country\u2019.\nThe National Party, together with its small ally, the Afrikaner Party, won \nper cent of the vote; the United Party alliance won  per cent. But the\nfavourable loading of rural seats gave the Nationalists a decisive advantage.\nThey gained a tenuous majority of five seats. \u2018Today, South Africa belongs to us\nonce more,\u2019 declared Malan in his election victory speech. \u2018For the first time\nsince Union, South Africa is our own, and may God grant that it will always\nremain our own.\u2019 The age of the generals had ended and the age of apartheid had\nbegun.\n\nMandela was twenty-nine years old at the time, an impecunious law student\nstruggling unsuccessfully to pass examinations for a law degree and dependent\non his wife\u2019s earnings to keep his young family afloat. He had developed strong\npolitical ambitions, but had so far failed to make his mark as a political activist.\nThe Congress Youth League, the small pressure group which he had helped to\nlaunch with the aim of giving \u2018force, direction, and vigour\u2019 to the ANC, had\nspent four years arguing over ideological positions, showing no propensity for\npolitical action. The ANC, after thirty-six years of efforts in dealing with\n\n\fgovernments which professed to be mindful of their \u2018trusteeship\u2019 of the African\npeople, had yet to achieve any significant gains in its campaign for African\nrights or in its attempts to halt the inexorable march of segregation. Now they\nfaced a government whose explicit objective was to keep \u2018die kaffir op sy plek\u2019\nand which was prepared to use power in a manner which South Africa had never\nbefore experienced.\nThe ruthlessness of the Nationalists became apparent at first in their handling\nnot of the African population but of the English-speaking community. Malan\u2019s\ngovernment was the first in the history of the Union to consist exclusively of\nAfrikaners. The upper echelons of the civil service, the armed forces, the police\nand parastatal organisations like the railways were purged of English-speakers\nand filled with carefully selected Afrikaners, usually members of the\nBroederbond. The state sector became virtually an Afrikaner preserve. The legal\nprofession eventually faced the same treatment; senior English-speaking\nmembers of the bar were systematically overlooked in the appointment of\njudges. The government also favoured Afrikaner business interests, switching\naccounts to Afrikaner financial institutions and awarding contracts to Afrikaner\ncompanies. The English-speaking community found itself on the defensive at\nevery turn. In an acrimonious debate in parliament, English-speaking members\nfaced accusations of dual allegiance and were questioned on their right to be\nconsidered full South Africans. The English would be given equal treatment,\nsaid one Nationalist speaker, but \u2018the country belongs, in the first instance, to\nthose people who opened it up\u2019.\nThe Nationalists then turned their attention to the Native problem. Malan, in\nhis mid-seventies when he came to office, had never shown much interest in\nNative policy. His preoccupation had always been to consolidate the Afrikaner\ncommunity behind his drive for power. He possessed no grand design for the\nAfrican population of the kind that other Nationalist leaders developed later. His\nprincipal aim was to reverse the trend towards interracial integration rather than\nto devise some final solution to the Native problem.\nHis first targets, accordingly, were marriage and sex. In  parliament\npassed the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, outlawing marriages between\nEuropeans and non-Europeans. Few such marriages ever took place\u2014less than\n a year out of an annual total of , white marriages\u2014but for the\nNationalists it was a blurring of racial lines they were not willing to tolerate. An\namendment to the Immorality Act extended a ban on sexual intercourse between\n\n\fEuropeans and Natives, in force since , to Europeans and Coloureds. Next\ncame the Population Registration Act, designed eventually to allocate every\nperson to one of three racial groups: White, Coloured or African. \u2018A national\nregister is the whole basis of apartheid,\u2019 declared Malan. Some of the early\nmethods used to determine a person\u2019s race were crude in the extreme. Doubtful\ncases were sometimes resolved by white officials with what became known as\nthe \u2018pencil in the hair\u2019 test. If a pencil stayed in the hair, it meant classification\nas a Coloured or African; if it fell out it meant classification as a Coloured or\nwhite. Small variations in the texture of hair or the shape of the lips could make\nall the difference in determining where people could live and work. The effect in\nmany borderline cases was to wreck families and ruin careers.\nThe advent of apartheid prompted Mandela and his radical friends in the\nCongress Youth League to demand a more aggressive strategy from the ANC. A\nnew document was drawn up calling for civil disobedience, boycotts and \u2018stayat-home\u2019 strikes on a mass scale.\nIn December , shortly before the ANC\u2019s annual conference was due to be\nheld in Bloemfontein, a Youth League delegation consisting of Mda, Sisulu,\nTambo and Mandela called on Dr Xuma at his home in Sophiatown to try to\nobtain his support for their plan. The ANC, they told him, had become too\ndocile. What was needed was mass action along the lines of Gandhi\u2019s passive\nresistance campaigns and the protests carried out by the Indian community in\nSouth Africa in . Like Gandhi, the ANC\u2019s leaders had to be prepared to\ncontravene the law and go to prison.\nXuma was dismissive. Such action would be premature, he said, and would\nmerely give the government an excuse to crush the ANC in the name of law and\norder. Furthermore, he had no intention of going to prison and forsaking his\nmedical practice. The four activists then gave Xuma an ultimatum: unless he\nsupported their plan of action, they would oppose his re-election as president at\nthe forthcoming ANC conference. Xuma reacted furiously to their challenge. \u2018I\ndon\u2019t want your vote,\u2019 he said. \u2018And I won\u2019t be dictated to by any clique.\u2019\nThe ANC\u2019s annual conference was duly held in an atmosphere of unusual\nexcitement. Many delegates, alarmed by the government\u2019s apartheid programme,\nwanted to end all trace of collaboration with government institutions and embark\non more determined action, as the Youth League proposed. The Youth League\u2019s\ndifficulty was in finding a respectable figure to stand as their candidate against\n\n\fXuma. The first person they approached, Professor Matthews, the distinguished\nacademic, declined the offer.\nIn the audience as a guest, however, was a man with a remarkable string of\ncredentials. Dr James Moroka came from a wealthy landowning family in the\nOrange Free State. He was a great-grandson of the Tswana chief Moroka, who in\nthe s had given military protection to groups of voortrekkers entering his\ndomain. His father was white, but he had taken his mother\u2019s name. After\ngraduating from the University of Edinburgh in medicine in , he had\nreturned to South Africa, one of only two black medical doctors in the country,\nand established a lucrative practice in Thaba \u2019Nchu. Local Afrikaners were\namong his patients. In accordance with South African custom, he provided one\nwaiting room for whites and another for blacks, one entrance for whites, another\nfor blacks. He was also a shrewd businessman, the owner of a large number of\nfarms, shops and other concerns. At his home in Thaba \u2019Nchu, he lived the life\nof a country gentleman, highly respected in the local community. He had helped\nin the building of schools and a hospital for local people and contributed funds to\nenable needy white students to train as doctors. He had shown no interest in\npolitics until the African franchise was threatened in , when he established a\nreputation as an outspoken opponent of government policy. As a member of the\nNative Representative Council, he used it as a platform from which to continue\nhis attacks on the government. The only credential he lacked, in fact, was\nmembership of the ANC; he was involved with another group, the All African\nConvention.\nIn the closing stages of the conference, after Moroka had indicated his support\nfor the \u2018Programme of Action\u2019, the Youth League decided to approach him. At\nfirst he was reluctant to stand against Xuma but finally he agreed. In the election\nthat followed, the older generation voted for Xuma and the younger for Moroka.\nMoroka won and the \u2018Programme of Action\u2019 was adopted as ANC policy. The\nYouth League\u2019s coup had succeeded.\nOther significant changes occurred at the same time. Believing that the\n\u2018Programme of Action\u2019 was \u2018too drastic\u2019, the ANC\u2019s long-serving secretarygeneral, the Reverend James Calata, declined to stand for re-election. Walter\nSisulu was elected in his place. Sisulu decided henceforth to devote his entire\ntime to building up the ANC, relying on Albertina\u2019s wages as a nurse to support\nhim and his family. Five other members of the Youth League were elected to the\nANC\u2019 s national executive committee, including Peter Mda and Oliver Tambo.\n\n\fMandela missed all the excitement. Having decided to abandon his studies for\na law degree, he had taken a job with the law firm of Terblanche and Brigish,\nwhich was not willing to allow him time off to attend the Bloemfontein\nconference. His employer, Harry Brigish, a left-wing lawyer, regarded Mandela\nas \u2018a fine and decent young fellow\u2019 but, like Sidelsky before him, disapproved of\nhis political activity.\nMandela\u2019s chance to join the national executive committee came two months\nlater, in February , when Dr Xuma, having failed to be re-elected president,\ndecided to resign his seat. At Sisulu\u2019s instigation, Mandela was co-opted in his\nplace. He viewed his new position with mixed feelings. He had enjoyed his days\nas a gadfly, attacking the establishment when inclined to do so. Now he was part\nof the ANC hierarchy, obliged to accept wider responsibilities.\nThe leadership of the ANC thus passed into the hands of a new generation of\npolitical activists. Some members of the old guard, like the Reverend Calata,\nretained their seats on the national executive committee. But the direction in\nwhich the ANC now moved was towards active opposition to the government of\nthe kind advocated in its \u2018Programme of Action\u2019.\nYet, despite all the efforts of the Youth League, there was still little\nideological clarity. Africanists like Mda and Mandela remained vehemently\nopposed to collaboration with communists. Communists like Kotane and Marks\nargued in favour of a broader front, trying to balance their loyalty to the cause of\nAfrican rights with their commitment to socialist revolution. Others, like\nProfessor Matthews, favoured a traditional liberal approach. All factions,\nhowever, were agreed on the need for direct action.\nThe role that Sisulu played as secretary-general, ensconced in new party\nheadquarters down a dingy corridor in New Court Chambers in Commissioner\nStreet, became increasingly important. His aim was to weld the different factions\nwithin the ANC into a united organisation and to extend its cooperation with\nother anti-apartheid groups, presenting the government with a more formidable\nadversary. \u2018I had gained sufficient confidence that we would survive as a\nnational group,\u2019 he said. \u2018We didn\u2019t need to be unnecessarily sensitive about\ncooperating with other groups.\u2019\nThe pressure of events came not just from the government but from a massive\noutbreak of communal violence in Durban in  between Africans and Indians\nwhich brought together ANC and Indian Congress leaders in an attempt to\n\n\fdefuse the crisis. Tension between the two communities, particularly in the\nslums around Durban, where both groups struggled to survive, was often close to\nthe surface. Many Indians were as contemptuous of Africans as whites were;\nIndian traders and landlords were resented in turn as exploiters. In a sudden\nconflagration, starting from one small incident, Africans burned down Indian\nhomes, clubbed their owners to death, raped wives and daughters and looted\nstores, killing in all some fifty Indians. Thousands of Indians fled their homes.\nNearly ninety Africans died, most of them in the ensuing police action. ANC\nleaders from Johannesburg joined in the efforts in Durban to calm the strife,\nrecognising the need for a fuller understanding of each community\u2019s problems.\nMandela remained opposed to links with other groups, even when the\ncommunists found themselves under direct assault from the government. Almost\nimmediately on assuming power, Malan had set up a committee to investigate\nthe influence of communism in the Union. It reported in  that the\nCommunist Party represented a danger to \u2018our national life, our democratic\ninstitutions and our Western philosophy\u2019. The result the following year was a\npiece of legislation eventually called the Suppression of Communism Act, which\ngave powers to the government to suppress not only the Communist Party but\nother opponents it deemed to be troublesome.\nBefore the legislation was passed, the communists initiated plans for a oneday strike on May Day , in protest against the government. Support for the\nplan was forthcoming from the Indian Congress as well as some ANC branches.\nBut it was adamantly opposed by Mandela and other members of the Congress\nYouth League, who accused the communists of trying to upstage the ANC,\nwhich had also called for a one-day strike in its \u2018Programme of Action\u2019 the\nprevious year but had so far failed to organise one. The Youth League\u2019s bulletin,\nAfrican Lodestar, attacked communism as a foreign ideology, equating it with\nmovements like fascism.\nSo hostile were Mandela and his colleagues that they took to breaking up\nCommunist Party meetings, canvassing support for the May Day strike, heckling\nspeakers and tearing up placards. At an ANC meeting in Newclare, Mandela\npushed the Indian speaker, Yusuf Cachalia, from the platform. In Commissioner\nStreet, he fell into a heated argument with the young Indian activist Ahmed\n\u2018Kathy\u2019 Kathrada, who accused him and the Youth League of refusing to work\nwith Indians and Coloureds.\n\n\fDespite the efforts of Mandela and other members of the Youth League, the\nMay Day strike achieved considerable success. Thousands stayed away from\nwork. But in four places\u2014Alexandra, Sophiatown, Benoni and Orlando\u2014the\nday ended in violence between police and crowds gathering on the streets in\nwhich eighteen people died. In Orlando, trouble broke out as police were\nescorting home workers who had ignored the strike. Mandela and Sisulu were\npresent at the time, endeavouring to persuade protesters to disperse. When police\nopened fire, they were forced to take refuge in a nearby nurses\u2019 hostel. \u2018That\nday,\u2019 recalled Mandela, \u2018was a turning point in my life, both in understanding\nthrough first-hand experience the ruthlessness of the police and in being deeply\nimpressed by the support African workers had given to the May Day call.\u2019\nTwo weeks later, angered by the police action, the ANC\u2019s national executive\ncommittee decided to call for another day of protest on  June, joining forces\nwith the Indian Congress. This time, the Youth League, humbled by the lack of\nsupport it had gained on the first occasion, issued a fiery statement in support of\nthe protest, concluding with the words, \u2018Up, you Mighty Race!\u2019\nThe Suppression of Communism Act, meanwhile, passed through parliament.\nIt was the first weapon in an arsenal of security measures acquired by the\ngovernment that over the next four decades would provide it eventually with\ntotalitarian control. So wide was the act\u2019s definition of communism that it could\nbe used to silence anyone who opposed government policy simply by \u2018naming\u2019\nthem. Communism now meant not only Marxist-Leninism but also \u2018any related\nform of that doctrine\u2019 which sought to bring about \u2018any political, industrial,\nsocial or economic change within the Union by the promotion of disturbance or\ndisorder\u2019, or which aimed at \u2018the encouragement of feelings of hostility between\nthe European and non-European races of the Union\u2019. In effect, the act equated\ncommunism with any determined form of opposition to apartheid. The\ngovernment was empowered to ban any organisation, to remove its members\nfrom public office, to place them under house arrest, to restrict their movements,\nto prohibit them from attending public or even social gatherings and to proscribe\ntheir writing and their speeches. No reasons had to be given in \u2018naming\u2019\ncommunists; nor was there any right of appeal. Such action could be taken,\nmoreover, against anyone who had ever professed communism.\nMeeting in Cape Town in June, before the act took effect, the central\ncommittee of the Communist Party debated whether to continue its work\nunderground. Among the seventeen members present were Bram Fischer,\n\n\fMichael Harmel, Yusuf Dadoo, Moses Kotane, and J. B. Marks. The difficulties\nof moving from legal work to illegal work without a pause were known to be\nconsiderable. The police were already in possession of membership lists, seized\nduring raids on party offices at the time of the mineworkers\u2019 strike in .\nAttempts to create the skeleton of an underground organisation had already\nfailed. The central committee decided, therefore, to disband the party to try to\nprotect its members, announcing its decision on  June, four days before the act\nbecame law.\nMany communists, however, remained politically active. African members,\nwho numbered , at the time, were able to channel their energies into the\nANC; senior figures like Kotane and Marks were already part of the ANC\nhierarchy. Indian members, who numbered , found a similar home in the\nIndian Congresses. Only the  white members lacked an immediate base from\nwhich to operate. But it was not long before they were to regroup and continue\ntheir work underground.\nThe day of protest on  June  was the ANC\u2019s first attempt ever to\norganise political action on a nationwide basis. Mandela played his part, helping\nto man party headquarters in New Court Chambers. But the organisers had left\nthemselves with too little time to make a success of it. The response in the\nTransvaal was poor; only in Port Elizabeth and among Indians in Durban was\nthere a significant result. No further mass action was attempted for another two\nyears.\n\nEven when he was breaking up Communist Party rallies and gaining a reputation\nas a hotheaded anti-communist, Mandela maintained close friendships with\nindividual communists and their influence began to tell on him. While some\ncommunists loudly denounced his activities, his group of communist friends\nwere always ready for discussion. He often visited the home of J. B. Marks, a\nwise and genial figure with a record of political activity dating back to the\ns. Moses Kotane, a pragmatic, clear-thinking man, frequently called on\nMandela in Orlando, talking late into the night, trying to convince him that his\nfears about a communist takeover of the ANC were unfounded. Indian\ncommunists like Yusuf Dadoo and his old student friend Ismail Meer, both of\nwhom had served prison sentences during the passive-resistance campaign,\nencouraged him to take a broader view. In no case could Mandela fault their\n\n\fcredentials as dedicated opponents of apartheid.\nThe influence of a number of white communists was also crucial. Among\nthem was Ruth First, a sharply intelligent journalist, whom Mandela had first\nmet as a student at the University of the Witwatersrand in his first term there in\n. Brought up in Johannesburg in a left-wing Jewish household, she had\nimmersed herself in political work, joining the Communist Party, serving as\nsecretary of the Young Communist League and helping to set up a left-wing\nclub, the Progressive Youth Council, into which she tried unsuccessfully to\nentice Mandela. Graduating with a social science degree, she worked briefly as a\nresearch officer for the Johannesburg City Council and helped to compile a\ncommemorative album for the city\u2019s fiftieth jubilee in . She resigned\nabruptly at the outbreak of the mineworkers\u2019 strike to throw herself into strike\nactivity, producing leaflets from duplicating machines set up in her own lodgings\nand driving African organisers to mine compounds to deliver them to strikers.\nWhen police arrested the entire district committee on charges of sedition, First\nwas asked to become temporary secretary of the Johannesburg party office. Six\nmonths later she became Johannesburg editor of The Guardian, a left-wing\nweekly newspaper written mainly by white communists. She made her own\nmark as a journalist in  with an expos\u00e9 of forced labour practices on white\nfarms in Bethal district in the eastern Transvaal, an investigation she undertook\nwith Michael Scott. \u2018I really respected that lady,\u2019 said Mandela, \u2018because of her\nintelligence and her commitment.\u2019\nFor several years, she had a close relationship with Mandela\u2019s Indian friend,\nIsmail Meer. Then in  she married Joe Slovo, a law student at Wits who was\nas ardent a communist as she was. The son of a poor Jewish immigrant family\nfrom Lithuania, Slovo had left school at the age of fourteen and joined the\nCommunist Party three years later, throwing himself tirelessly into party work\n\u2018in the certainty that the revolution was around the corner\u2019\u2014a belief that never\nreally left him. After serving in an army signals unit during the war, he enrolled\nat Wits to study law. It was during his final year there that he met Mandela,\nspending hours arguing with him about communist preparations for the May Day\nstrike. After graduating in , Slovo specialised as a defence lawyer in\npolitical trials. The Slovo household in Roosevelt Park in the northern suburbs of\nJohannesburg was to become a regular meeting place for political activists in the\ns.\nThen there was Michael Harmel, another journalist and the party\u2019s leading\n\n\ftheoretician. Mandela had met Harmel at his first encounter with communists at\na social gathering to which Nat Bregman had invited him. Taking care to dress\nproperly for the occasion, with a jacket and tie, as Fort Hare had taught him,\nMandela was disconcerted to find that Harmel, whom he had been told held a\nmaster\u2019s degree, was not wearing a tie. \u2018I just could not reconcile this\ndiscrepancy,\u2019 he recalled. Harmel, in fact, possessed few social graces, but it was\nprecisely this dislike of convention that Mandela found so attractive. He led a\ndisorganised, forgetful life, but was admired by his colleagues for his analytical\nmind and theoretical knowledge. Much of his influence stemmed from his\nreadiness, as a doctrinaire communist, to provide answers and explanations for\nany issue that arose. Drawn to Marxism while studying economics at Rhodes\nUniversity, he had joined the Communist Party in  and for nine years served\non the central committee, until the party was disbanded in . He was known\nas a forceful debater and one of the most rigid party men in Johannesburg.\nThe most remarkable communist of all was Bram Fischer. Not only was he an\nAfrikaner but he came from the Orange Free State aristocracy. His grandfather\nhad been prime minister of the Orange River Colony during the era of British\nrule and his father had served as Judge-President of the Orange Free State. A\nRhodes Scholar at Oxford University, an accomplished sportsman and a\nsuccessful lawyer, he moved with ease in the highest political and social circles\nin South Africa, widely admired for his many talents and regarded as having a\nbrilliant career ahead of him.\nBut Fischer had taken a different road. After graduating in law from the\nUniversity of Cape Town, he had become involved in adult education courses\nfor Africans in Waaihoek location in Bloemfontein, where he taught reading and\nwriting in a dilapidated building with winter winds blowing dust through the\nmakeshift classroom. It was there, he said later, that he came to understand \u2018that\ncolour prejudice was a wholly irrational phenomenon and that true human\nfriendship could extend across the colour bar. . . . That I think was Lesson\nNumber One on my way to the Communist Party.\u2019 He participated in meetings\nof the Joint Council of Europeans and Africans in Bloemfontein, a liberal\ninstitution with branches around South Africa where whites and blacks, usually\nteachers and clergymen, discussed African conditions; he found his encounters\nwith Africans there a \u2018real breakthrough\u2019. A visit he made to the Soviet Union in\n, while on vacation from Oxford, left him deeply impressed by Soviet\nachievements and he subsequently became a true believer in both communism\n\n\fand the Soviet Union, attracted not so much by ideological considerations as by\nthe humanitarian ideals that underpinned the communist faith.\nHis life became filled with efforts to assist the African cause. He served along\nwith Dr Xuma on the Alexandra Health Committee, the only form of\nadministration that Alexandra township possessed, he joined the Johannesburg\nJoint Council and he helped the ANC to draw up a new constitution. He was\nready at all times to act in defence of those in difficulty with the police, as on the\noccasion when he came to the rescue of Mandela\u2019s Indian friends.\nHis wife, Molly Krige, who was related to the Smuts family, shared his ideals,\nstanding as a Communist Party candidate in local elections in Johannesburg in\n, though without success. On summer weekends their house in Oaklands\nwas open to friends and acquaintances of all races. At the annual dances for The\nGuardian which they held in Beaumont Street, up to  guests would come.\nThe impression that Bram Fischer made on Mandela was profound, as much on a\npersonal level as a political one. But what was especially important in\ninfluencing Mandela\u2019s own outlook was that Fischer was an Afrikaner. In an age\nwhen Afrikaners were coming to be regarded by Africans as the enemy,\nMandela had found an Afrikaner friend.\nIt was by keeping such company that Mandela\u2019s hostility towards the\ncommunists began to dissipate. Feeling the need to be able to counter their\narguments over doctrinal issues, he started to study Marxist literature, finding\nsome of the ideas it contained appealing: \u2018I found myself strongly drawn to the\nidea of a classless society which, to my mind, was similar to traditional African\nculture where life was shared and communal.\u2019 He also found aspects of Marxist\neconomic analysis relevant. Above all there was the communist call for\nrevolutionary action, together with the practical example that the Soviet Union\nset in supporting liberation movements among colonial peoples.\nBut it was as much the need for allies in facing the onslaught of apartheid\nlegislation that brought Mandela to recognise the value of collaboration with\nother groups. As one by one the pillars of the apartheid system were erected and\never more draconian measures were introduced to suppress the government\u2019s\nopponents, the idea of Africans \u2018going it alone\u2019 began to look increasingly\nimpractical. Following the Population Registration Act in  came the Group\nAreas Act, a piece of legislation intended over the years to divide every town\nand village in South Africa into separate racial zones, even though this would\n\n\finvolve uprooting whole communities. Then, in March , Malan turned his\nattention to the Coloured community, introducing a bill\u2014the Separate\nRegistration of Voters Bill\u2014aimed at removing the Coloureds of the Cape\nProvince from the common roll by which they had been entitled to vote since\n.\nUntil Malan came to power, the Coloured community had largely escaped the\nkind of repressive measures inflicted on the African population by successive\nwhite governments. In the Western Cape, where most lived, the Coloureds could\nreside, work and travel where they chose. In areas of Cape Town, they shared\nthe same streets and sometimes the same houses as whites. They also shared the\ncommon roll. In nine Cape constituencies, their voting power was considerable\nand used mainly in favour of Smuts\u2019s United Party in the  election.\nIn attempting to get rid of the Coloured vote, Malan precipitated both a\nprotracted legal battle by the Coloured community and a wave of political\nprotest. A new organisation formed by Coloureds, the Franchise Action\nCommittee, called for strike action and asked for support from other antiapartheid groups. The support they received came not only from the ANC but\nalso from white protesters. A group of white ex-servicemen calling themselves\nthe Torch Commando organised a series of torch-lit rallies in Cape Town, Port\nElizabeth and Johannesburg which drew significant support from the white\npopulation. But the Torch Commando soon reached the limits to which\ntraditional liberals in South Africa were then prepared to go. While supporting\nthe campaign for the rights of the Coloured population, it failed to agree over the\nadmission of Coloureds as members, with the result that Coloured exservicemen withdrew. Thus ended the first and last major protest by whites\nagainst the apartheid system.\nTaking stock of all the protest activity under way, by Coloureds, Indians and\nAfricans alike, Walter Sisulu introduced the idea of a coordinated civildisobedience campaign against the government, involving trained volunteers\nfrom all groups who would deliberately court arrest and imprisonment by\ncontravening selected laws and regulations in ways similar to the Indian passive\nresistance campaign of . If sufficient numbers were arrested, the jails would\noverflow and the system would begin to break down.\nWhen he first heard the idea, Mandela was enthusiastic, but he wanted the\ncampaign to be exclusively African. Although his resistance to the communists\n\n\fwas waning, he remained wary of the influence of Indians in any joint campaign.\nHis Africanist views were still firmly held. In , he had been elected as\npresident of the Youth League, the last stronghold of the Africanist camp. For\nmonths, Mandela continued to hold out stubbornly against a joint campaign,\neven though the tide of opinion in the ANC was running strongly against him. At\nan ANC national executive meeting in June , when joint action with Indian\nand Coloured organisations was proposed, his arguments against it were\npromptly voted down. At the ANC\u2019s annual conference in December ,\nwhen he spoke again in favour of a \u2018go it alone\u2019 strategy, he was given similarly\nshort shrift. Only when faced with an overwhelming vote in favour of joint\naction did Mandela commit the Youth League to support it.\nIn January , an ultimatum calling for the repeal of six \u2018unjust laws\u2019,\nsigned by Dr Moroka and Sisulu, was sent to Prime Minister Malan. Among the\nlaws cited were the Suppression of Communism Act, the Group Areas Act, the\nSeparate Registration of Voters Bill and the pass laws, which Malan\u2019s\ngovernment had enforced with ever-greater vigour. Unless the government\ncomplied, the signatories warned, a \u2018Defiance Campaign\u2019 would start. Malan\u2019s\nsecretary replied that the government had no intention of repealing the laws and\nwarned that it would \u2018use the full machinery at its disposal to quell any\ndisturbances\u2019. The date then set for the start of the Defiance Campaign was \nJune, the anniversary of the day of protest in . It was a date that was to\nbecome a focal point in the calendar of resistance activity for years to come.\nThe biggest names in the campaign were Moroka and Dadoo. Other key\nfigures included Marks, Sisulu and Yusuf Cachalia, the Indian activist whom\nMandela had once pushed from the platform. Mandela too, despite his prolonged\nopposition to joint action, was given a central role, being appointed national\nvolunteer-in-chief. His main task involved the recruitment, training and\ncoordination of volunteers. Their mission was to flout apartheid laws through\nacts of defiance such as using railway coaches, waiting rooms and platform seats\ndesignated for Europeans only, or by parading on the streets after curfew without\npermits, or by entering locations without permits. Whenever possible, the\nauthorities were to be forewarned of the intentions of each batch of volunteers;\nin some cases, full lists of names of the volunteers involved were politely handed\nto the police. Following this level of protest would come mass defiance.\nAddressing groups of potential volunteers, Mandela warned of the difficulties\nand dangers they would face from the authorities, who would retaliate with\n\n\farrests, imprisonment and possibly violence. But whatever happened, he told\nthem, they were to respond to violence with nonviolence. Mandela believed that\nnonviolent protest was essential, not on moral grounds, as propounded by Indian\ncampaigners like Manilal Gandhi, the Mahatma\u2019s son, but for purely practical\nreasons: any attempt at violence would be swiftly crushed.\nFour days before the campaign was due to start, Mandela addressed a rally in\nDurban called the Day of the Volunteers, organised jointly by the ANC and the\nIndian Congress. Some , Africans and Indians turned out to participate. It\nwas the first occasion that Mandela had addressed a mass audience and he found\nthe experience exhilarating. The Defiance Campaign, he said, would make\nhistory. It would be the most powerful action ever undertaken by the masses in\nSouth Africa: \u2018We can now say unity between the non-European people in this\ncountry has become a living reality.\u2019 For Mandela, the remark had personal as\nwell as political significance in view of his long-held opposition to interracial\ncooperation.\nHe displayed a remarkable optimism about what could be achieved by such\nmethods of protest:\nI visualized that if the Defiance Campaign reached the stage of mass defiance,\nthe government would either say to the ANC . . . we will repeal these laws, we\nwill remove discrimination and from now on everybody in this country . . . is\nentitled to vote for members of parliament . . . or, if the government refused to\ntake this attitude, we would expect the voters, because of the situation, to say, we\ncan\u2019t go on with a government like this; we think that the government should\nmake way for a government which is more sensible, more responsible, a\ngovernment which will change its policy and come to terms with these people;\nand then they would vote it out of power.\nThe campaign began in a mood of exuberance. Early in the morning, a group\nof volunteers in Port Elizabeth marched through the \u2018Europeans Only\u2019 entrance\nat the railway station, singing freedom songs and accompanied by a cheering\ncrowd of friends and family. They were promptly arrested by police. The same\ncheerful atmosphere surrounded the next planned event later in the day in\nBoksburg, east of Johannesburg, when a small group of Africans and Indians,\nled by Walter Sisulu and a veteran Gandhi supporter, Nana Sita, walked into the\nAfrican location without entry permits, holding up their thumbs in the Congress\nsalute. Mandela was present, but only as a spectator. He had previously\n\n\fdelivered a letter to the Boksburg magistrate, advising him that a group of\nvolunteers would enter the location without permits. All the group were taken\noff to the police cells. That night, ANC supporters meeting in the Garment\nWorkers\u2019 Hall in Anderson Street in Johannesburg left the building after the\ncurfew had started at  p.m. and were arrested.\nMandela, who had been attending a meeting of his own with other campaign\nleaders in a nearby office at the time, was not due to stage his own act of\ndefiance until later in the campaign. But emerging on to the streets at midnight\nwith Yusuf Cachalia, thinking of nothing more than the need for a hot meal and\nsome sleep, he suddenly found himself under arrest. He felt like explaining that\nit was not his turn to be arrested. But, along with Cachalia, who burst out\nlaughing at the irony of it all, he was taken away in a police truck to the cells in\nMarshall Square, a gloomy red-brick police station in the city centre, and joined\nthe fifty or so volunteers there.\nThis was Mandela\u2019s first experience of police cells and the treatment meted\nout there. In the drill yard that night, a young white policeman pushed one of the\nvolunteers so forcefully that he fell down some steps and broke his ankle.\nMandela, who had been walking close by at the time, immediately protested,\nwhereupon he was kicked on the shin and told to keep quiet. Eventually a senior\npoliceman was called. When Mandela demanded medical attention, he was told\nto put in his request the next day. The volunteer spent the night groaning with\npain. Mandela stayed in the cells for two days, before being released on bail.\nThe campaign quickly caught the popular imagination. The slogan \u2018Mayibuye\nAfrika!\u2019\u2014\u2018Let Africa return!\u2019\u2014became a common greeting on the streets. With\nalmost religious fervour, days of prayer, hymn-singing and church services were\nheld throughout the country. During July, more than , people were arrested\nfor acts of civil disobedience; in September, the peak of the campaign, the\nnumber reached ,. In five months, nearly , people went to prison for\nperiods ranging from one to three weeks, most of them charged under the\nSuppression of Communism Act.\nNo longer was white help spurned. At a public meeting in November at\nDarragh Hall in Johannesburg, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo and Yusuf Cachalia\nurged an audience of  whites to join forces by forming \u2018a parallel white\norganisation\u2019 to work in close cooperation with the ANC and the Indian\nCongress.\n\n\fThe silence of European democrats to the challenge of the issues\ninvolved in the Defiance Campaign is being construed by NonEuropeans as acquiescence in and approval of the government\u2019s policies,\nthus rapidly creating the belief among large numbers of Non-Europeans\nthat all whites are hostile to them and their aspirations and that the\nsituation is being transformed into a white versus non-white struggle.\nIn December, in one of the final acts of defiance, when a group of volunteers\nbroke permit regulations in Germiston, their number included seven whites, one\nof whom, Patrick Duncan, was the son of a former governor-general. Duncan\u2019s\nact of defiance gave the campaign both prestige and respectability. \u2018It came as a\ngift from heaven,\u2019 remarked Cachalia. \u2018It stopped the campaign from becoming\nracial.\u2019\nThe government, meanwhile, reacted not in the conciliatory manner that\nMandela had anticipated but with ruthless determination to crush the campaign.\nIn July, police raided the offices of the ANC and the Indian Congress and the\nhomes of their officials, confiscating documents and papers, and then arrested\ntwenty leaders of the campaign in Johannesburg, including Mandela, Sisulu,\nMarks, Moroka, Dadoo, and Cachalia, charging them with promoting\ncommunism. Mandela was arrested in the office of the law firm of H. M. Basner,\nfor which he was working at the time, but, like the others, he was subsequently\nreleased on bail.\nTheir trial in November became the focus of national attention. For the first\ntime, ANC leaders faced the prospect of imprisonment for political protest\nagainst the government, an event which distinguished the Defiance Campaign\nfrom all previous protests over the past forty years. Crowds of supporters\ngathered outside the Johannesburg magistrates\u2019 court. In a packed courtroom, all\nwere found guilty of what was termed \u2018statutory communism\u2019. But as the judge\nin the case, Judge Franz Rumpff, admitted, \u2018This has nothing to do with\ncommunism as it is commonly known.\u2019 Furthermore, he accepted that though\nthe accused had planned acts that ranged from \u2018open non-compliance of laws to\nsomething that equals high treason\u2019, they had consistently instructed their\nsupporters \u2018to follow a peaceful course of action and to avoid violence in any\nshape or form\u2019. They were sentenced to nine months\u2019 imprisonment with hard\nlabour, but the sentence was suspended for two years.\nBut far from being an occasion for demonstrating their solidarity against the\n\n\fgovernment, the trial became the source of considerable acrimony. For Dr\nMoroka, a pillar of respectability in his community, the idea of being convicted\nof supporting communism and going to prison for it was too hard to bear.\nBreaking ranks with the rest of the accused, he decided to employ his own\nlawyer. Mandela\u2019s efforts to get him to change his mind were to no avail. At the\ntrial, he alone took the witness stand to declare his total opposition to\ncommunism and entered a separate plea of mitigation that stressed his long\nfriendship with the Afrikaner people and the assistance he had given them. His\nfinal assertion was that he did not believe in racial equality. To have the\nfigurehead of the campaign forsake it at its climax was a humiliating blow.\nTo ensure that not only this campaign was stamped out but that no similar one\ncould ever be started again, the government employed new measures. In\nDecember, banning orders were imposed on fifty leaders and organisers,\npreventing some, like Marks and Dadoo, from participating in any ANC or\nIndian Congress activity for life and others for lesser periods. Mandela was\nbanned from meetings of all kinds and restricted to the district of Johannesburg\nfor a period of six months. New legislation was then introduced which laid down\nsevere penalties of fines, imprisonment and corporal punishment for anyone\ninciting others to commit civil-disobedience offences and which empowered the\ngovernment to declare a state of emergency and use emergency regulations\nwhenever \u2018the maintenance of public order was endangered\u2019. The effect was to\nmake protest virtually illegal.\nThe Defiance Campaign of  transformed the ANC from an elite group\ninto a mass movement. The sight of Africans defying the government won it new\nprestige. The fear of refusing to submit to white authority lost its sting. Its\nmembership rose from , to perhaps as many as ,. The campaign\nshowed, moreover, what could be achieved through African and Indian\ncollaboration. Abroad, the African cause gained international attention for the\nfirst time.\nBut the Defiance Campaign also marked a high point in ANC activity. Never\nagain, during the s, was it able to mount successfully such organised\nresistance against the government. Deprived of most of its leaders, fearful of\nreprisal from the government\u2019s arsenal of security measures and short of funds,\nthe movement lost much of its momentum. For another two years, no major\ncampaigning was undertaken.\n\n\fNevertheless, the sense of achievement among those like Mandela who had\nparticipated in it was profound. \u2018The campaign freed me from any lingering\nsense of doubt or inferiority I might still have felt,\u2019 he said. \u2018It liberated me from\nthe feeling of being overwhelmed by the power and seeming invincibility of the\nwhite man and his institutions.\u2019\nBut an even more important personal transformation had begun during the\ncourse of the campaign. For practical reasons, Mandela had come to accept that\na multiracial strategy was necessary in dealing with the government, abandoning\nthe Africanist notions that he had held for so long. In time, his support for a\nmultiracial strategy developed into a unshakeable conviction about the\nimportance of a multiracial approach in striving for non-racial democracy which\nnever wavered, even under the greatest pressure the government could inflict.\nWhat the Defiance Campaign also showed was that Mandela harboured na\u00efve\nillusions about both the government and the white population\u2014illusions that\nwere to remain with him for many years, with disastrous consequences.\n",
    "1953-1959": " THE \u2018M\u2019 PLAN\nALONGSIDE THESE POLITICAL DRAMAS, MANDELA\u2019S CAREER AS A\nlawyer was slowly taking shape. Although he had abandoned his studies for a\nlaw degree, his intention to qualify as an attorney held firm. After working for\nTerblanche and Brigish for about one year, he joined another liberal firm,\nHelman and Michel, passing his qualifying exam in . Needing a testimonial\nto join the Transvaal Law Society, Mandela went to see Lazar Sidelsky, his old\nemployer, with whom he had served his articles. Sidelsky took the opportunity to\nwarn him to stay out of politics. \u2018\u201cYou\u2019ll end up in jail sooner or later,\u201d I said.\nMandela replied, \u201cFor the benefit of my people I must carry on.\u201d I retorted,\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do more for your people if you set an example to them. Let your people\nbecome educated. Don\u2019t worry about politics.\u201d\u2019 Sidelsky recalled with humour,\n\u2018I felt inclined not to give him that testimonial.\u2019\nMandela\u2019s next employer, Hyman Basner, the first to hire him as a qualified\nlawyer, was more accustomed than Sidelsky to the political hurly-burly in which\nradical lawyers became involved. A former communist who had served as a\nNatives\u2019 representative in the Senate, he was well known for his passionate\nsupport of African rights. \u2018A strike, a boycott, a clash between Africans and the\npolice\u2014where such a thing happened, there would Basner arrive at speed\nprepared to speak and, as a lawyer, to defend Africans in court,\u2019 Eddie Roux,\nanother former communist, wrote of him. It was at the offices of H. M. Basner\nthat Mandela was arrested on charges under the Suppression of Communism\nAct. Unlike Sidelsky, Basner made no objections to Mandela\u2019s political\nactivities, as long as his work for the law firm was handled properly.\nHe embarked on his first case in court, armed with a battery of legal books\nand brimming with confidence. The magistrate duly found his client not guilty.\n\u2018I started to swell with pride. Then the magistrate said, \u201cMr Mandela, I have\nfound your client not guilty, not because of you, but in spite of you.\u201d He said all\nthe books I had brought had nothing to do with the case, adding, \u201cI hope that,\n\n\fone day, when another poor accused comes to you, you will at least know what\nbooks to bring.\u201d\u2019\nAfter several months working for Basner, Mandela felt ready to set up his own\nlaw practice, opening an office in August . He then persuaded Oliver\nTambo, who had given up his teaching post at St. Peter\u2019s to take up law five\nyears before and who had also just qualified as an attorney, to join him in a\npartnership.\nAs partners, as well as political colleagues, they made an interesting contrast.\nTambo was by nature quiet and thoughtful, with a cool, logical mind; deeply\nreligious, he was still contemplating the possibility of ordination. At St. Peter\u2019s,\nhe had been immensely popular with his students, and among staff he was highly\nrespected for his principled approach, arguing resolutely against those who\ncriticised his involvement as a teacher in politics. \u2018Where men cannot help\nthemselves, they must be helped by others who are able,\u2019 he said. \u2018I want to help\nlead the struggle for African liberation. How can you claim this is not the role of\nthe teacher? I refuse to be diverted from it.\u2019\nMandela was altogether more assertive, more combative and more emotional,\nquicker to anger and with a liking for action. At the law firm of Kovalsky and\nTuch, where Tambo worked before joining Mandela, a white secretary, Betty\nShein, accustomed to Tambo\u2019s modest demeanour, noticed the contrast with\nMandela, who often came round at lunchtime to discuss ANC business with him.\nMandela, she recalled, would stride into the reception area, glancing around to\nsee whether anyone was going to greet him; if he encountered only sullen stares,\nas was customary when blacks entered a white office, he would call out, \u2018Mr\nTambo, please,\u2019 and make a point of sitting in a whites-only chair, causing a\nconsiderable stir, not least because nobody in the office addressed Tambo as\n\u2018Mr\u2019.\nMandela made the same point in magistrates\u2019 court, ignoring the segregation\nrules which applied there, choosing the whites-only entrance and always ready\nwith an answer when challenged. Once, when a supposedly white clerk, whose\nfeatures clearly suggested mixed parentage, shouted at him, \u2018What are you doing\nin here?\u2019 Mandela leaned over the counter towards him, staring straight into his\neyes, and said quietly, \u2018What are you doing in here?\u2019\nThe firm of Mandela and Tambo opened for business in December  in\nChancellor House, Fox Street, a shabby building across the road from the\n\n\fmagistrates\u2019 courts, owned by Indians who were prepared to take on African\ntenants. They were soon inundated with clients. Each morning, queues of\nAfricans crowded into the small waiting room, stretching back into the corridors\nand down the stairs. Many of them were victims of the apartheid system, caught\nin the web of pass laws, curfew laws, liquor laws, residence laws and\nemployment laws which made criminals of ordinary people. From Mandela and\nTambo they received a sympathetic hearing and a willingness to act.\nMandela was in and out of court all day, using the courts as an opportunity to\nchallenge white authority and gaining a reputation as a bold courtroom\nperformer. In some courts he was treated by officials with courtesy; in others\nwith resentment and hostility. White witnesses often refused to answer his\nquestions directly, speaking only to the magistrate. Police witnesses regarded\nhim with contempt.\nOne white magistrate in Kempton Park, a village east of Johannesburg, so\nresented the appearance of Mandela before him that he did his utmost to prevent\nhim from proceeding in court. Acting on behalf of an African clerk accused of\nfraud, Mandela rose to introduce himself to the magistrate, Willem Dormehl.\nMANDELA: I appear for the accused, Your Worship.\nMAGISTRATE: And who are you?\nMANDELA: My name is Nelson Mandela, Your Worship. I appear for\nthe accused.\nMAGISTRATE: How can you appear for the accused? Are you an\nattorney?\nMANDELA: Yes, of course, Your Worship.\nMAGISTRATE: Where is your certificate?\nMANDELA: I don\u2019t usually walk around with my certificate, Your\nWorship.\nMAGISTRATE: How then am I supposed to know that you are an\nattorney?\nMANDELA: I suggest you telephone the registrar of the court in\nJohannesburg or Pretoria and ask him whether or not my name is still on\nthe roll of attorneys. . . .\n\n\fMAGISTRATE: I am not prepared to do that. This case will be\npostponed and you can come again with your Certificate of Admission as\nan attorney.\nMANDELA: May I suggest that we proceed with the case? The accused\nfaces a number of charges. The case will not finish today. I can produce\nmy certificate on the subsequent day on which the hearing of the case\nwill be resumed.\nMAGISTRATE: It will be quite irregular to do it that way. The case will\nbe postponed. Mr Prosecutor, what date do you suggest?\nPROSECUTOR: The nd, Your Worship.\nMANDELA : (in an aside to the prosecutor, but within earshot of the\nmagistrate) I am not available on the nd. Can you make it either the\nst or the rd?\nPROSECUTOR: I would suggest the rd, Your Worship.\nMAGISTRATE: Mr Prosecutor, you have already suggested the nd. I\nhave written it down. I am not going to scratch it out or amend my\nrecord. You don\u2019t have to agree to a date suggested by a person who has\nnot satisfied me that he is entitled to appear in my court. The case will be\npostponed to the nd.\nMANDELA: But. . . !\nMAGISTRATE: I have already postponed the matter. I will not hear\nanother word that you have to say in my court. Call the next case, Mr\nProsecutor.\nMandela sought the assistance of a young white colleague, George Bizos, a\nformer law student at the University of the Witwatersrand who had recently\nqualified as an advocate. Born in a rural village in Greece, Bizos had been forced\nto flee at the age of thirteen, along with his father, to escape the German advance\nand had arrived in Johannesburg in , the same year as Mandela. They were\nto form a lifelong friendship. Bizos agreed to take on Mandela\u2019s previously\narranged case, leaving him free to return to Kempton Park to confront Dormehl.\nMandela duly presented his certificate and the case was allowed to proceed. But\nno sooner had Mandela begun a cross-examination of the first witness than the\nmagistrate made a series of interruptions.\n\n\fMAGISTRATE: You cannot ask that. The question is not clear to me.\nThe witness doesn\u2019t have to answer that question.\nMANDELA: Would Your Worship record my question and your ruling\nthat it is not admissible?\nMAGISTRATE: You are not here to tell me how to run my court. I will\nrecord that which I consider relevant.\nMANDELA : The record must be a fair reflection of what transpires in\ncourt. If you disallow questions, you are supposed to note the question\nand the fact that you disallowed it.\nMAGISTRATE: I am warning you that you are not here to teach me my\njob. Ask your next question.\nAfter some fifteen minutes of interruptions, Mandela\u2019s patience was wearing\nthin.\nMANDELA: Your Worship makes it very difficult for me . . .\nMAGISTRATE: Just one moment. I want to write something down.\n(Having done so, Dormehl turned to the accused.) Your attorney has\nwithdrawn from these proceedings. You have the right to continue . . .\nMANDELA: Your Worship . . .\nMAGISTRATE: You sit down and keep quiet. (To the accused) You\nhave the right to conduct your own defence as a result of your attorney\u2019s\nwithdrawal . . .\nMANDELA: Your Worship . . .\nMAGISTRATE: Sit down or I will commit you for contempt. (To the\naccused) Or you may ask for a postponement in order to get a new\nattorney to represent you.\nMANDELA: I have not withdrawn from this case. I want it recorded that\nI have not withdrawn. I want it recorded that I merely said that you are\nmaking it difficult for me to continue my cross-examination.\nMAGISTRATE: I have told you to sit down and keep quiet. You no\nlonger have locus standi in my court.\nMANDELA: I protest. I am still appearing for the accused.\n\n\fMAGISTRATE: I will count to three and if you have not sat down by\nthen, I will commit you for contempt and ask the court orderly to take\nyou to the cells. I order you to sit down.\nMandela remained standing while Dormehl counted slowly to three. The\nmagistrate then ordered Mandela to be removed from court. The court orderly, a\nyoung constable, moved in his direction. \u2018You had better not touch me if you\ndon\u2019t want any trouble,\u2019 Mandela warned. The constable hesitated. Mandela\npicked up his files and walked out of court with the words \u2018I\u2019ll be back.\u2019\nAfter discussing with Bizos what course of action to take, Mandela decided to\nget his client to petition the Supreme Court, asking Dormehl to recuse himself on\nthe grounds that he had objected to the client being defended by a black attorney.\nWhen the matter came before Judge Quartus de Wet, Dormehl was given short\nshrift. \u2018This is the sort of thing that brings the administration of justice into\ndisrepute in our country,\u2019 de Wet told Dormehl\u2019s lawyer. \u2018Tell your client that\nthe quicker he recuses himself from this case, the better for all concerned.\u2019\n\nMandela throve on the racial tension in court, determined to show that blacks did\nnot have to buckle to white pressure. He relished subjecting police witnesses to\nrelentless cross-examination and taking issue with hostile magistrates like\nDormehl. One of his articled clerks, Godfrey Pitje, recalled, \u2018Nelson would walk\ninto court as if it was his own. He sent shivers through some of the officials.\u2019\nHis court appearances gained a popular following. Hearing of an impending\nMandela court case, township residents would fill the public gallery, applauding\nloudly on occasion, to the fury of court officials. Mandela\u2019s showmanship in\ncourt duly became part of his reputation. He was fond of telling the story of his\ndefence of an African servant accused of stealing clothes belonging to her\n\u2018madam\u2019. Beginning his cross-examination of the \u2018madam\u2019, Mandela walked\nover to a table where the stolen clothes were on display, studied them and then,\nwith the tip of his pencil, picked up a pair of panties. Turning slowly to the\nwitness box, he asked, \u2018Madam, are these . . . yours?\u2019 Too embarrassed to admit\nthat they were, she replied, \u2018No.\u2019 The case was dismissed.\nOutside the courtroom, Mandela\u2019s performance was not always so effective.\nAmong the advocates briefed by Mandela was Harold Wolpe, a communist\nlawyer who had studied with him at the University of the Witwatersrand. Wolpe\n\n\fdescribed Mandela\u2019s briefings as \u2018none too meticulous\u2019. In the office, it was\nTambo, with his prodigious capacity for work, who shouldered most of the\nburden. A young student from St Peter\u2019s, Fikile Barn, who went to the offices of\nMandela and Tambo on Saturdays, the busiest day of the week, to learn how a\nlaw office functioned, noticed how \u2018Mandela would dash in for two hours then\ndash out again, while Tambo put in full hours\u2019. Political activity was Mandela\u2019s\nfavourite occupation.\nThe law practice of Mandela and Tambo, however, was not secure from the\ntentacles of apartheid. Under the terms of the Urban Areas Act, Africans were\nnot permitted to occupy business premises in the city without ministerial\nconsent. When they applied for consent, it was never granted. Instead they were\ngiven a temporary permit under the Group Areas Act. When that expired, the\nauthorities would refuse to renew it, insisting that they should leave the city and\npractise in an African township miles away from where their clients could reach\nthem during working hours. \u2018This was tantamount to asking us to abandon our\nlegal practice,\u2019 Mandela recalled. So they continued to remain in Chancellor\nHouse, but illegally and with the threat of prosecution and eviction hanging over\ntheir heads.\nA more serious threat came from the Transvaal Law Society, which in April\n petitioned the Supreme Court to have Mandela struck off the role of\naccredited attorneys on the grounds that his political activities, for which he had\nbeen convicted under the Suppression of Communism Act, constituted\nunprofessional and dishonourable conduct. With Bram Fischer\u2019s help, Mandela\nsecured the services of a distinguished advocate, Walter Pollack, chairman of the\nJohannesburg Bar Council, who agreed to appear pro amico for Mandela. Judge\nRamsbottom, who heard the case, upheld Mandela\u2019s position, finding that there\nwas nothing dishonourable in an attorney campaigning for his political beliefs,\neven if his activities infringed the law.\nDespite these hazards, the firm of Mandela and Tambo prospered. For the first\ntime in his life, Mandela became relatively affluent. He purchased a large\nOldsmobile, indulged his taste for fine clothes and cut a dashing figure across\nJohannesburg society, equally at ease at multiracial parties as the back alleys of\nblack townships. His physical presence was striking\u2014he was six feet two inches\ntall and broad-shouldered\u2014and he exuded confidence and energy. When he first\nset foot in the Observatory home of two communist friends, Rusty and Hilda\nBernstein, one of their children ran into the kitchen shouting excitedly: \u2018There\u2019s\n\n\fa giant in the front room!\u2019 After that he was known in the Bernstein family as\n\u2018the giant\u2019.\nHe was able to afford suits from Alfred Kahn, a fashionable tailor favoured by\nmembers of the prestigious Rand Club in Loveday Street nearby. George Bizos\ncame across him there on one of his errands as a lawyer\u2019s clerk, collecting a list\nof customers late with their payments; Mandela was there for a final fitting. He\nfrequented Kapitan\u2019s, a smart Indian restaurant on Kort Street, as well as cheaper\nhaunts like Moretsele\u2019s, a caf\u00e9 on Pritchard Street, where the proprietor, Elias\nMoretsele, a staunch ANC supporter, allowed friends to eat on credit. He was\nwealthy enough to return favours to people who had once helped him. Lazar\nSidelsky remembered how one wet, windy night, as he waited on the street for a\nbus to take him home, ruing a business failure which had left him financially\ncrippled, Mandela drew up in his Oldsmobile, offered him a lift home and, on\nthe way, mentioned that he had not yet repaid a loan of \u00a3\u2014a substantial sum.\nSidelsky brushed the matter aside, saying it was of no account, and Mandela did\nnot pursue the matter then, but a few days later Sidelsky received in the post a\ncheque for \u00a3.\nMandela was also a familiar figure in boxing circles. On most weekday\nevenings, he would drop by for an hour or two of training at a boxing club at an\nOrlando community centre which he joined in . Like all the other boxing\nclubs which flourished in Orlando, it was poorly equipped. There was no ring;\nboxers trained on a cement floor. The club, consisting of both amateur and\nprofessional boxers, nevertheless managed to produce several champions.\nBoxing was the most popular sport among Africans at the time and boxing\nchampions were accorded high status. The greatest hero of all was Jake Tuli, an\nOrlando boy who became the British Empire flyweight boxing champion. His\ntriumph abroad was all the more significant since at home African boxers were\nnot allowed to box white opponents. Mandela was in the heavyweight division.\nHe enjoyed the tactics of boxing rather than the physical confrontation and his\nmain interest was in the training sessions, which served as an outlet for stress\nand tension. But it all added to his reputation as a dynamic young leader.\nMandela\u2019s political standing, as a result of the Defiance Campaign and his\nsubsequent trial, had never been higher. Before his six-month ban in December\n, he had become a well-known figure on the platform at public meetings at\nFreedom Square in Fordsburg, in Alexandra, in Sophiatown and in Orlando. In\nOctober , when the Transvaal ANC was searching for a new president to\n\n\freplace Marks, who had been banned from membership of the ANC for life,\nMandela was chosen for the post. His colleagues sometimes noticed about him a\ncertain imperiousness, particularly when giving orders. Both Walter and\nAlbertina Sisulu tried to persuade him to adopt a less lofty manner in public.\n\u2018But,\u2019 Albertina recalled, \u2018he was a Xhosa aristocrat and his training from\nchildhood had made him the way he was, aloof and sometimes a bit arrogant. It\ndidn\u2019t matter, because the people liked to look up to a leader who was regal and\nmaybe even a bit distant.\u2019\nHis family life suffered grievously from all this activity. So little time did\nMandela spend at home during the  protests that his son, Thembi, then five\nyears old, asked his mother, \u2018Where does Daddy live?\u2019 A second son, Makgatho,\nwas born at this time. Mandela managed to get to the hospital for the birth, but,\nas he later observed, \u2018it was only a brief respite\u2019. When the banning order was\nplaced on Mandela\u2019s political activities, Evelyn secretly welcomed it.\nThe marriage soon ran into serious difficulties. Because Evelyn\u2019s earnings as\na nurse were no longer essential to keep the family afloat, she decided in  to\nenroll for a course on midwifery at King Edward VII hospital in Durban. While\nshe was away, the two children were cared for in Orlando by Mandela\u2019s mother\nand sister. She returned at the end of  to find Mandela in the thick of an\naffair with a secretary he employed at his office. To Evelyn\u2019s fury, she made free\nuse of the family home, even following Mandela into the bedroom and the\nbathroom. When Evelyn objected to her presence, Mandela became enraged.\nOnly when Evelyn threatened to throw boiling water over her did the visits to the\nhouse stop. But the affair continued.\nAnother friendship that Mandela made at this time was also the subject of\nmuch rumour. Lilian Ngoyi was a vivacious and energetic woman from poor\norigins who had for years worked as a machinist in a clothing factory in\nJohannesburg, until the Defiance Campaign inspired her, at the age of forty-one,\nto throw herself tirelessly into political activity. She rose quickly to become the\nmost prominent woman in the ANC in the s. Her talent as a public speaker,\nwith a direct, emotional style, was admired by all who heard her.\n\u2018When she spoke from a platform,\u2019 wrote her friend Helen Joseph, \u2018she could\ndo as she wished with her audience; they laughed with her, wept with her.\u2019 In\nconversation, her face was alive with expression, her hands constantly on the\nmove. Mandela, among many others, found her immensely attractive. Living in\n\n\fOrlando, she often visited Mandela\u2019s house, and her work for the ANC, as\npresident of the Women\u2019s League, regularly brought them together. Mandela\nalways denied that they were lovers, but the rumours persisted for many years.\nMandela\u2019s frequent absences from home became a constant source of\nargument. Evelyn, knowing of the rumours about his involvement with other\nwomen, took to questioning him about his movements, eventually provoking\nMandela to respond, \u2018No policeman asks questions like you.\u2019 Evelyn never\nunderstood Mandela\u2019s deep commitment to political activity, believing his\ninterest to be no more than a youthful aberration which would in time fade away.\nNor did she become reconciled to the idea of living permanently in\nJohannesburg, expecting that they would eventually return to the Transkei to\nplay a prominent role in the community there, as Mandela himself had once\ntalked of doing.\nAnother source of dispute between them developed soon after the birth of a\ndaughter, Makaziwe, in . Since the death of their first daughter, Evelyn had\nprayed fervently for another girl. The arrival of Makaziwe she took to be a sign\nfrom God. \u2018It was then that I began my return to my Christian faith,\u2019 she said.\nShe became a devout Jehovah\u2019s Witness, even attempting to convert Mandela to\nher belief, arguing that her religious faith was a higher cause than his politics. A\ntussle between religion and politics soon engulfed the Mandela household,\ncentering on the children. Evelyn would take them to church at every\nopportunity, read them Watchtower literature and get them to distribute\nWatchtower pamphlets in Orlando; Mandela would instruct them in politics,\nearnestly explaining the significance of pictures he had hung on the wall of\nChurchill, Stalin, Roosevelt, Gandhi and the storming of the Winter Palace in St.\nPetersburg in .\nThe marriage sank to the level of sullen silence. Mandela became increasingly\ncold and distant, spending even more time away from home.\n\nFrom , Mandela was never free from the attention of the police Special\nBranch. His movements, his contacts, his speeches, like those of other prominent\npolitical activists, were all recorded in police dos - siers. Informers and police\nagents infiltrated deep into the hierarchy of the ANC as well as the rank and file,\ncreating an atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust. The sudden increase in ANC\nmembership, prompted by the Defiance Campaign, made it especially vulnerable\n\n\fto police infiltration, leading Mandela to warn of \u2018many shady characters\u2019 within\nits ranks\u2014saboteurs, agents provocateurs, informers, splitters and place-seekers:\n\u2018Outside appearances are highly deceptive, and we cannot classify these men by\nlooking at their faces or listening to their sweet tongues, or by their vehement\nspeeches demanding immediate action.\u2019\nPolice raids on ANC offices and the homes of officials became a constant\nhazard. \u2018The raids began in the early s,\u2019 recalled Sisulu. \u2018Raids on our\nhomes, raids on the offices. It became impossible to keep any proper records\nfrom that time on. You couldn\u2019t keep a diary, you couldn\u2019t keep minutes, and\nnot having proper records was very frustrating. There was a lot of harassment,\nwhich made my job as secretary-general very difficult.\u2019\nThe Special Branch in time acquired more and more powers, acting without\nrestraint, indifferent to any notion of legal rights and answerable only to\nministers. It had started out as a small unit in  in Marshall Square, keeping\ntrack of illicit gold and diamond dealings, but had developed a political role\nduring the war, monitoring anti-government organisations like the Broederbond,\nbefore switching its attention in post-war years to the Communist Party. The\nNationalist government had turned it into a political arm, separate from the rest\nof the police force, giving it licence to act as it saw fit in dealing with political\ndissidents. Special Branch detectives regularly invaded political meetings,\nrecording speeches, photographing members of the audience, noting car number\nplates outside. An attempt to prevent them attending private meetings initially\nsucceeded. A Supreme Court judge ruled that the police were not entitled as of\nright to be present. \u2018This is not yet a police state,\u2019 he declared. But the\ngovernment soon overcame this by amending the law, enabling the police to sit\nin on any meeting they wanted to. The Special Branch tapped phone calls,\nintercepted mail, bugged meetings, kept activists under constant surveillance and\nused threats and intimidation with their employers and families. It was directly\nresponsible for making recommendations about banning orders, about\nbanishment to internal exile and other methods of putting dissidents \u2018out of\naction\u2019. Its dossiers were never closed.\nThe activists delighted in trying to outwit Special Branch detectives, regarding\nmost of them as being inept and incompetent. Between the two sides there were\nmany cases of cautious familiarity. Special Branch men tended to address ANC\nactivists by their first names. Occasionally, at the end of the day, the head of the\nJohannesburg Special Branch, Major At Spengler, a heavy, thick-set Afrikaner\n\n\fdetective, would call in at a shebeen in a printing works in Market Street, used\nby the ANC to produce pamphlets, for a quiet drink with leading activists and\nblack journalists who congregated there.\nCompared to the era of torture, solitary confinement, indefinite detention\nwithout trial and murder which followed, the s were a relatively benign\ndecade in the annals of the security police. Assaults on political prisoners were\nextremely rare, lawyers could gain access to arrested activists without difficulty\nand house searches still required a magisterial warrant. When Head Constable\nCarl Johannes Dirker, a lugubrious figure who dogged the lives of many activists\nyear after year, once arrived at Michael Harmel\u2019s house, he was asked whether\nhe had a warrant. He sheepishly replied that, being in a hurry, he had taken the\nwrong file, so Harmel\u2019s warrant was still in his office. \u2018What, then, are you\nlooking for?\u2019 asked Harmel. \u2018Politics, man, politics,\u2019 he replied.\nHowever inefficient the Special Branch may have been, government\nrepression exacted a heavy toll. Banning orders preventing activists from\nattending meetings, restricting their movements to specific districts, prohibiting\ntheir involvement in political organisations and trade unions had a debilitating\neffect. Mandela recalled in his autobiography:\nBanning not only confines one physically, it imprisons one\u2019s spirit. It induces a\nkind of psychological claustrophobia that makes one yearn for not only freedom\nof movement but spiritual escape. Banning was a dangerous game, for one was\nnot shackled or chained behind bars; the bars were laws and regulations that\ncould easily be violated and often were. One could slip away unseen for short\nperiods of time and have the temporary illusion of freedom. The insidious effect\nof bans was that at a certain point one began to think that the oppressor was not\nwithout but within.\nThe ANC itself suffered from a similar paralysis. Its attempts to hold public\nmeetings were frequently blocked by the authorities, printers refused to handle\nANC pamphlets for fear of prosecution and most newspapers declined to publish\nANC statements. \u2018The old methods of bringing about mass action through public\nmass meetings, press statements and leaflets calling upon people to go into\naction have become extremely dangerous and difficult to use effectively, \u2019\nMandela warned an ANC meeting in the Transvaal, held in the aftermath of the\nDefiance Campaign. In an endeavour to circumvent police harassment and to\nprepare the ANC for the possibility of an outright ban, as had happened to the\n\n\fCommunist Party, Mandela drew up a new plan for political action, advocating a\nradical departure from the methods previously adopted by the ANC.\nIt was popularly known as the \u2018M\u2019 Plan, named after Mandela but not given\nhis full name to avoid implicating him in ANC activity at a time when he was\nsupposed to be banned. It involved splitting the entire movement into small units\n\u2014\u2018cells\u2019 at street level, \u2018zones\u2019 and \u2018wards\u2019 covering larger areas of townships\n\u2014providing a means of communication throughout the organisation without the\nneed to call public meetings and issue statements and enabling it to survive\ngovernment repression. Part of the plan required branch leaders and other\nofficials to organise political lectures for the benefit of local members. The\nlecturers were often banned members. Mandela himself, despite being banned,\nfrequently gave lectures in the evening to groups in Orlando.\nThe \u2018M\u2019 Plan, to which the ANC\u2019s national executive attached \u2018the highest\nimportance\u2019, according to Mandela, was implemented in only a few places,\nmostly in towns in the Eastern Cape. It placed a huge burden of work on local\nofficials, far beyond their capacity to carry it out. There were no funds to pay\nparty workers; everything depended on volunteers working in their spare time.\n\u2018Most people were so busy with their ordinary work that they could not find time\nfor Congress duties,\u2019 a Natal ANC official reported. The plan also ran into\nresistance from branch leaders with strong local bases opposed to changes which\nundermined their own influence.\nMandela\u2019s frustration at being hemmed in by the government began to boil\nover into reckless talk about the use of violence. Shortly after his six-month ban\nexpired in June , he addressed a public meeting in Freedom Square in\nSophiatown, telling the crowd that the time for passive resistance had ended, that\nnon-violence would never defeat a white minority government bent on retaining\npower at any cost and that the only weapon that would destroy apartheid was\nviolence, which Africans would have to use in the near future. With the crowd\nclapping and cheering, Mandela went on to sing a freedom song with the words\n\u2018There are the enemies, let us take our weapons and attack them.\u2019 The crowd\njoined in. When it was over, Mandela pointed to the police clustered around the\nperimeter of Freedom Square and shouted, \u2018There, there are our enemies.\u2019 The\ncrowd cheered and made aggressive gestures at the police. The police looked\nnervous, Mandela recalled in his autobiography: \u2018A number of them pointed\nback at me as if to say, \u201cMandela, we will get you for this.\u201d\u2019\n\n\fIn secret with Walter Sisulu, Mandela went further. Through the assistance of\ncommunist friends, Sisulu had received an invitation to attend a student festival\nin Bucharest in  and he had arranged to extend his journey abroad with\nvisits to China and the Soviet Union. Before leaving, he agreed with Mandela to\napproach the Chinese about the possibility of their supplying weapons for an\narmed struggle. The Chinese expressed support for the ANC\u2019s political efforts,\nbut warned against armed struggle. The idea was premature, they felt. Sisulu was\ntold, \u2018Don\u2019t play about with it.\u2019 On his return, neither of them took the matter\nfurther, nor did they disclose to their ANC colleagues what had occurred.\nLoose talk about the use of violence appalled other senior figures in the\nANC\u2019s leadership, in particular its new president, Albert Luthuli, who had been\nchosen to replace the discredited Dr Moroka at the annual conference in\nDecember . Luthuli was a man of great moral authority and dignity who\nduring the s came to personify the ideals of non-racialism and non-violence\nespoused by the ANC. Unlike his two predecessors, Xuma and Moroka, he was\nat home in the world of popular politics and mass action, having a genuine\ninsight into the concerns and problems of ordinary people. He also conformed to\nthe image many whites held of the \u2018Good Native\u2019: he was a devout Christian, a\nMethodist lay preacher and a tribal chief, with a slow and courteous demeanour.\nFor fifteen years he had taught at Adams College in Natal, an American mission\nhigh school, and for seventeen years he had served as chief of the Umvoti\nMission Reserve in Zululand. But drawn into the world of African politics in the\ns, he displayed an unexpected determination to fight for African rights. As\npresident of the ANC\u2019s Natal region, he had no hesitation in supporting the\nDefiance Campaign, nor did he see any conflict in doing so with his role as\nchief.\nThe government thought otherwise. In October , Luthuli was summoned\nto Pretoria and given an ultimatum: he was to resign from either the ANC or the\nchieftaincy. Luthuli refused to make that choice and was duly dismissed as chief.\nIn a personal statement about his dismissal, entitled \u2018The Road to Freedom is\nvia the Cross\u2019, Luthuli explained his sense of disillusionment about \u2018the path of\nmoderation\u2019 he had followed hitherto:\nWho will deny that thirty years of my life have been spent knocking in vain,\npatiently, moderately at a closed and barred door? What have been the fruits of\nmy many years of moderation? Has there been any reciprocal tolerance or\n\n\fmoderation from the Government, be it Nationalist or United Party? No! On the\ncontrary, the past thirty years have seen the greatest number of laws restricting\nour rights and progress until today we have reached a stage where we have\nalmost no rights at all . . . in short, we have witnessed in these years an\nintensification of our subjection to ensure and protect white supremacy.\nHe went on:\nThis stand of mine . . . might seem foolish and disappointing to some liberal and\nmoderate Europeans and non-Europeans with whom I have worked these many\nyears and with whom I still hope to work. This is no parting of the ways but \u2018a\nlaunching further into the deep\u2019 . . . I have embraced the non-violent passiveresistance technique in fighting for freedom because I am convinced it is the\nonly non-revolutionary, legitimate and humane way that could be used by people\ndenied, as we are, effective and constitutional means to further aspirations.\nLuthuli went to great lengths to try to reassure whites about African political\nintentions. He spoke of the future in terms of African \u2018partnership\u2019 in\ngovernment rather than absolute control of it, accepting \u2018the fact of the\nmultiracial nature of the country\u2019. The ANC\u2019s goal, he wrote in his\nautobiography, \u2018is not that Congress shall rule South Africa, but that all Africans\nshall participate in ownership and government\u2019.\nHe placed great faith in the moral impact on whites of the African struggle\nand possessed an abiding optimism that whites would sooner or later be\ncompelled to change heart and accept a shared society. It was such thinking\nwhich set the tone of ANC policy throughout the s.\nMandela\u2019s remarks in Sophiatown about the use of violence consequently\nearned him a severe reprimand from the ANC\u2019s national executive. The Special\nBranch also exacted its revenge. In September , Mandela was served with\nan order under the Suppression of Communism Act requiring him to resign from\nthe ANC, restricting him to the Johannesburg district and prohibiting him from\nattending meetings or gatherings for two years. At the age of thirty-five,\nMandela\u2019s career as a leading ANC activist was brought abruptly to a halt.\nHenceforth, his involvement had to be conducted in a clandestine manner. From\nbeing at the centre of political activity, Mandela was forced to remain on the\nsidelines, able to exert little influence over the direction the ANC took.\nOther setbacks were to follow.\n\n\fSophiatown was one of the most vibrant African communities in South Africa. It\nwas the home of writers, musicians, journalists and politicians like the former\nANC leader Dr Xuma. In its narrow, crowded streets were schools, churches,\ncinemas, shops and night-clubs and the only swimming pool for African children\nin the whole of Johannesburg. It was famous for its gangsters and its shebeen\nqueens, for its nightly toll of murders and knife fights, and for its passion for\njazz and dance parties. Drinking establishments like the Back of the Moon and\nthe Thirty-nine Steps attracted the African elite in business, sports and\nentertainment from all over Johannesburg. On Sunday afternoons the Odin\ncinema was a regular venue for well-organised \u2018jam sessions\u2019, featuring popular\nvocal groups like the Manhattan Brothers quartet and their lead singer, Miriam\nMakeba, and bringing together white as well as black musicians. Sophiatown\nproduced its own stars, including Wilson Silgee\u2019s Jazz Maniacs and Dolly\nRathebe, the blues singer who starred in the  film Jim Comes to Joburg and\nbecame one of the most sought-after women of the s. It also boasted an allAfrican female band, the Sophiatown Scottish, who dressed in tartan kilts and\nwhite gloves and paraded through the streets on Sundays to the accompaniment\nof drums and trumpets. Its racy, hard-drinking, exuberant style, influenced by\nAmerican jazz and gangster movies, set the pace for the rest of black urban\nSouth Africa. Black youths referred to it proudly as \u2018the centre of the\nmetropolis\u2019. The sense of drama and excitement it generated was captured\nregularly on the pages of the popular monthly magazine Drum, whose writers,\nlike Sophiatown\u2019s Can Themba, were at the forefront of a new wave of\ninvestigative journalism, satire, commentary, fiction and musical criticism and\nwhose readers, as its young English editor, Anthony Sampson, noted, \u2018thought\nand spoke in jazz and exclamation marks\u2019. Drum used Sophiatown as the\nyardstick of what readers wanted to read about. Sophiatown\u2019s resident\ncommunity of , was predominantly African but included substantial\nminorities of Coloureds, Indians, Chinese and even some whites attracted to its\nbohemian lifestyle.\nAs famous as Sophiatown\u2019s musicians and writers were its gangs. Two\neffectively divided Sophiatown into rival zones: the Berliners controlled the\nterritory between Ray Street and Johannes Road, while the Americans held sway\nbetween Toby Street and Meyer Street. The Berliners tended to engage in smallscale crime, in particular payroll robberies. The Americans specialised in\n\n\fstealing goods from city shops and railway delivery trucks, recycling them in\nSophiatown. \u2018Sophiatown creaked with stolen property,\u2019 recalled Michael\nDingake, a former resident. Food, liquor, clothes, cutlery, household appliances\nand furniture items all sold at a fast pace at give-away prices. Gang leaders liked\nto see themselves as folk heroes, courageous and clever enough to become\nwealthy at the expense of whites. They dressed in flashy \u2018American\u2019 clothes,\ndrove American-made cars and copied the style of American cinema gangsters,\nlike Richard Widmark in the film Street with No Name. A motto they favoured\nwas taken from Willard Motley\u2019s novel about a young American gangster,\nKnock on Any Door, which was popular locally: \u2018Live fast, die young, and leave\na good-looking corpse.\u2019\nAmid the noise and bustle of this urban maze stood an Anglican mission,\nwhose church, Christ the King, dominated the skyline. Its priest-in-charge,\nTrevor Huddleston, was a familiar figure on the dusty streets of Sophiatown,\ndressed in a white flowing cassock and large black hat and usually surrounded\nby crowds of grubby urchins calling out \u2018Fader\u2019. Because of his close-cropped,\nGerman-style hair-cut, he was often referred to in the adult community as \u2018die\nJerry\u2019. Huddleston had arrived in Sophiatown in  at the age of twenty-nine\nafter training in a Yorkshire monastery for a monastic order in the Church of\nEngland called the Community of the Resurrection. Like Michael Scott, he had\nbecome a political activist, but at a much slower pace. Scott complained, during\nthe Tobruk crisis, that Huddleston had failed to come to his aid; and Huddleston\nlater admitted that it had taken him a long time to \u2018wake up\u2019 to the realities of\nSouth Africa. But once aroused, his commitment to the African cause became\nunshakeable. With immense energy, moral zeal and a flair for publicity, he\ntackled the authorities over one issue after another, campaigning tirelessly with\ndiplomats, businessmen and officials for support in improving African urban\nlife. With the same gusto, he threw himself into the nationalist fray, developing\nclose friendships with Oliver Tambo and Yusuf Cachalia and earning himself the\nenmity of the government. \u2018In the Middle Ages,\u2019 said one government minister,\nJan de Klerk, \u2018people like Michael Scott and Huddleston would have been\nburned at the stake.\u2019 After six years in Sophiatown, Huddleston moved to the\nsouth side of Johannesburg to take up the post of superintendent of St. Peter\u2019s\nSchool in Rosettenville. But his heart remained in Sophiatown. As prominent\nchurchman Charles Hooper once noted, \u2018Made in Sophiatown\u2019 was branded\nupon his personality. And it was over Sophiatown that Huddleston was to\nengage in his most dogged campaign against the government.\n\n\fWhat enabled Sophiatown to develop such a distinctive character was no more\nthan an accident of history. In  a speculator called Herman Tobiansky\nbought  acres of land on the slopes of a rocky ridge four miles west of\nJohannesburg, intending to establish a new white suburb there. He named it after\nhis wife, Sophia, and pegged out streets with the names of his children: Edith,\nGerty, Bertha, Toby and Sol. But his plans went awry when the council decided\nfirst to establish a sewerage-disposal site nearby and then a municipal location\nfor Africans called Western Native Township next door. Unable to attract a\nsufficient number of white buyers, Tobiansky resorted to selling his plots to\nAfricans, Coloureds and Indians, as he was then entitled to do. Sophiatown,\nalong with its two adjoining districts of Martindale and Newclare, thus\ndeveloped as a \u2018freehold\u2019 township, its houses of all shapes and sizes lining steep\nstreets which climbed the hillside. Unlike municipal locations, there was no\nfence surrounding it, no superintendent to allocate houses, no policeman to\nexamine permits at the gate and no restrictions on who came and went. \u2018The\nstreets of Sophiatown were never deserted, they were always full. There was\nalways life, people going up and down like ants,\u2019 recalled one former resident.\n\u2018Sophiatown had variety, Sophiatown had difference.\u2019\nIn reality, much of Sophiatown had degenerated into a slum. Though some\nimpressive houses remained, like Dr Xuma\u2019s, most buildings were decaying and\ndecrepit, their yards packed tightly with shacks and hovels in which whole\nfamilies struggled to survive. Landlords crammed as many tenants as possible\ninto one property, often charging them exorbitant rents; as many as eighty\npeople lived on one stand, sharing a single water tap and a single toilet. Much of\nthe area was a health hazard. Yet despite the squalor, Sophiatown retained a\nstrong sense of community. \u2018Whatever else Sophiatown was, it was home,\u2019\nwrote Bloke Modisane. \u2018We made the desert bloom; made alterations; converted\nhalf-verandas into kitchens, decorated the houses and filled them with music.\nWe were house-proud. We took the ugliness of life in a slum and wove a kind of\nbeauty.\u2019\nWith the growth of Johannesburg, however, Sophiatown became encircled by\nwhite suburbs. Only a narrow stretch of open veld separated it from the prim\nwhite suburb of Westdene. The residents there soon began to agitate for the\nremoval of this \u2018black spot\u2019. Bowing to white pressure, in  the\nJohannesburg municipality approved a scheme for its removal, but then took no\naction. The Nationalist government, however, saw an opportunity for enforcing\n\n\fits apartheid policy and in June  announced plans to move the entire\npopulation to a new site under municipal control called Meadowlands, nine\nmiles from Johannesburg, close to the existing township of Orlando. It cited the\nneed for slum clearance in Sophiatown as the reason, although elsewhere in\nJohannesburg there were slums under municipal control where conditions were\nfar worse. No freehold ownership was to be allowed in Meadowlands.\nThe plan ran into a storm of protest. Father Huddleston formed one protest\ncommittee and Dr Xuma another. The ANC, stirring itself for the first time since\nthe end of the Defiance Campaign, decided in conjunction with the Indian\nCongress to organise a joint protest at the Odin cinema. Among the speakers\ninvited were Huddleston, Yusuf Cachalia and Mandela, whose six-month\nbanning order had just expired.\nThe Odin cinema on that Sunday morning in June  was packed with some\n, residents. Huddleston arrived, hotfoot from conducting mass at the Church\nof Christ the King, and immediately fell into an altercation with Special Branch\ndetectives, questioning their right to attend; the Special Branch men grudgingly\nwithdrew. Shortly after Huddleston had finished his speech, a group of armed\npolice strode in, marched on to the stage and arrested the next speaker, Yusuf\nCachalia, dragging him towards the exit. The crowd rose to their feet, shouting\nand booing. Mandela, fearing an ugly turn of events, jumped on to the stage and\nbegan singing a well-known protest song, getting the crowd to join in.\nHuddleston, pursuing Cachalia through the exit, found himself confronting \narmed police on the street outside. He remonstrated with the officer in charge\nand eventually the police withdrew, allowing the meeting to continue. Cachalia\nwas later released without being charged. \u2018I had seen and felt, in those moments,\nthe terrifying spectre of the police state,\u2019 Huddleston wrote in his book Naught\nfor Your Comfort. \u2018There was the fierce breath of totalitarianism and tyranny in\nevery attitude, every movement of the police.\u2019\nProtest meetings in Freedom Square in the centre of Sophiatown and in other\nlocations continued week after week. With Special Branch detectives recording\nevery word in their notebooks, speakers vied with each other to impress the\ncrowds with their bravado and fearlessness in denouncing the government.\nBloke Modisane recorded, \u2018Every Sunday morning we assembled at Freedom\nSquare, Morris and Victoria Road, to be stampeded into orgiastic reverberations\nof resounding slogans by thumb-raising politicians trading on mob passions, and\none after another they mounted the platform almost in an effort to outdo the\n\n\fother by the sheer volume of noise.\u2019 The crowds responded in kind with shouts\nof \u2018Asihambi\u2019\u2014\u2018We will not move!\u2019\nMandela addressed many such meetings, depicting Sophiatown as \u2018the battle\nbetween reactionary forces and the forces of liberation\u2019 and raising the spectre of\nviolent opposition, before being silenced by his second banning order in\nSeptember . His involvement in the campaign nevertheless continued. He\nwas a frequent visitor to the So - phiatown home of Robert Resha, the local ANC\nleader well known for his militant views. He was also able to act there in his\nprofessional capacity as a lawyer, advising and defending residents.\nThe ANC placed great store on the success of its Sophiatown campaign,\nbelieving that it was an issue that would galvanize popular resistance to\napartheid elsewhere. Chief Luthuli called for it to become the \u2018Waterloo of\nApartheid\u2019. Resha recruited some  volunteers in Sophiatown ready to come\nto the assistance of any residents threatened with eviction.\nYet the campaign was marked by confusion and disputes. The ANC entirely\nunderestimated the willingness of a large number of tenants to escape their slum\nconditions and move to better housing at cheaper rents in a new township. Local\norganisers found themselves accused of acting simply to defend the interests of\nlandlords. When Resha\u2019s volunteers appeared in uniform on the streets for the\nfirst time, the black newspaper The World reported sourly that \u2018many of the\nvolunteers were the sons and relatives of property owners\u2019. Moreover, neither\nthe volunteers nor the residents wishing to stay were given any clear idea from\nthe ANC about how they should resist or for how long. While urging residents\nnot to move from an area where their homes were to be bulldozed, the ANC was\nunable to organise anything but temporary accommodation elsewhere.\nEven as the day of reckoning approached, there was still no sign of a coherent\nplan, as Bloke Modisane recorded:\nIt began to be rumoured around the protest meetings, in and about Sophiatown,\nthat we would resist, by force if necessary, the will of the government; a\ncampaign with a top-secret plan was whispered in the wind, the hush-hush Mplan which would be implemented on the night of the day before the first\nremovals; the top-secret plan was of such priority in secrecy that there was found\nno one who knew any details about it, except that it would spring into effective\naction on the night before removal day.\nThe first group of  families were warned in December  that they\n\n\fwould have to leave their homes by  February . Without making any\ncontingency plans, the ANC assumed that the government would not act until \nFebruary. When the government abruptly announced on  February that the\nremovals would take place the following morning, therefore, the ANC was\ncaught unprepared.\nA group of young activists meeting that night were in favour of erecting\nbarricades and defying the police with whatever weapons came to hand. But the\nANC\u2019s leaders, including Mandela, ordered them to stand down, believing that\nviolence would have disastrous consequences.\nAt dawn on  February, a large convoy of trucks and armed police moved into\nSophiatown, taking control of every street corner and cordoning off two streets\nscheduled for removal. Within a few hours, the trucks were on their way, with\ntenants sitting atop stacks of furniture, stoves and bedding. Some were singing,\n\u2018To Meadowlands we will go . . . \u2019 Once they had gone, the demolition squads\nmoved in.\nThere was no resistance, no demonstration, no disruption, just slogans on the\nwalls saying \u2018We Won\u2019t Move!\u2019 The ANC had chosen the ground on which to\nstand and had suffered abject failure. Its campaign had been little more than a\npropaganda exercise.\nMandela admitted the ANC\u2019s shortcomings, but drew other conclusions. \u2018The\nlesson I took away from the campaign was that, in the end, we had no alternative\nto armed and violent resistance,\u2019 he wrote in his autobiography. \u2018Over and over\nagain, we had used all the non-violent weapons in our arsenal\u2014speeches,\ndeputations, threats, marches, strikes, stay-aways, voluntary imprisonment all to\nno avail, for whatever we did was met by an iron hand.\u2019\n\nThe destruction of Sophiatown was but the first of a series of forced removals\nwhich tore apart long-established communities in South Africa\u2019s towns. Tens of\nthousands of families were uprooted from their homes under the Group Areas\nAct, on the pretext of preserving racial harmony. The Indian communities in\nJohannesburg\u2019s western districts of Pageview, Vrededorp and Fordsburg, where\nthey had lived for seventy years, building substantial houses, temples, mosques,\nschools, clinics, cinemas, libraries, businesses and restaurants, were ordered to\nquit and move to Lenasia, a \u2018group area\u2019 for Indians twenty miles south-west of\n\n\fthe city which the government insisted was to become the sole location for\nJohannesburg\u2019s Indians. Pageview was declared a white area in , even\nthough no whites were living there. A similar fate befell the Indian community\nin Durban, which once owned a quarter of the total area of the city. In the\nTransvaal, hundreds of Indian businessmen and traders were expelled from\ncentral business districts, to the considerable advantage of white shopkeepers. In\nCape Town, District Six, an area close to the city centre occupied by Coloureds\nsince , was razed to the ground, its residents forced to move to a bleak tract\nof land ten miles away. Compensation was paid to families ordered to leave but\nusually at derisory rates. White property speculators were able to amass fortunes\nout of the forced sale of houses. In Sophiatown, the new white suburb which\narose from the rubble was named Triomf.\n\nYear by year, the apartheid machine gathered increasing momentum. The\ndriving force behind it was a Dutch-born ideological fanatic, Hendrik Verwoerd,\nwho aspired to create in South Africa a new racial order. Appointed as Minister\nof Native Affairs in , he had already played a prominent role in shaping\nNationalist doctrine and theories both as a professor of sociology at the\nUniversity of Stellenbosch and as editor of the Nationalist paper Die Transvaler.\nVerwoerd believed that his own rise to prominence was as much a matter of\ndivine inspiration as of the policies he propounded and he allowed nothing to\ndeflect him from his purpose. \u2018I do not have the nagging doubt of ever\nwondering whether perhaps I am wrong,\u2019 he said.\nIn , Verwoerd turned his attention to the system of African education. For\nmore than  years it had remained largely in the hands of church missions.\nAbout  per cent of all schools were mission schools, administered by some\nforty mission bodies. Most were heavily dependent on state assistance for the\npayment of teachers\u2019 salaries and school equipment. In many cases they suffered\nfrom low teaching standards, inadequate equipment and overcrowded classes.\nThere was always a shortage of funds. Less than half of all African children of\nschool age attended any school at all. But however poor the education offered,\nthe schools provided a vital lifeline into the world of employment and the chance\nof an income. The start of each school year was marked by desperate struggles\nby mothers trying to get their children into schools.\nVerwoerd decided that control of African education should be wrested from\n\n\fthe churches, explaining his reasons in the long, didactic speeches he was fond\nof making.\nRacial relations cannot improve if the wrong type of education is given to\nNatives. They cannot improve if the result of Native education is the\ncreation of a frustrated people who . . . have expectations in life which\ncircumstances in South Africa do not allow to be fulfilled. . . . Above all,\ngood racial relations cannot exist when the education is given under the\ncontrol of people who create wrong expectations on the part of the Native\nhimself, if such people believe in a policy of equality. People who\nbelieve in equality are not desirable teachers for Natives. Education must\ntrain and teach people in accordance with their opportunities in life,\naccording to the sphere in which they live.\nBantu education should stand with both feet in the reserves and have\nits roots in the spirit and being of Bantu society. . . . There is no place for\nhim in the European community above the level of certain forms of\nlabour. . . . Until now he has been subject to a school system which drew\nhim away from his own community and misled him by showing him the\ngreen pastures of European society in which he is not allowed to graze. . .\n. What is the use of teaching a Bantu child mathematics when it cannot\nuse it in practice? That is absurd.\nUnder the terms of the Bantu Education Act, which Verwoerd introduced in\n, church missions were given the choice of turning their schools over to the\ngovernment or continuing with them as private schools with gradually\ndiminishing subsidies. All schools, whatever their status, would have to be\nregistered by the government. No private schools would be allowed to exist\nwithout government approval. Control of schools would pass not to the\nDepartment of Education but to the Department of Native Affairs. Introducing\nthe new legislation before parliament, Verwoerd was forthright about its\npurpose: \u2018Natives will be taught from childhood to realize that equality with\nEuropeans is not for them.\u2019\nOpposition to the Bantu Education Act was widespread, both among churches\nand within the African community. Verwoerd\u2019s blunt explanations left little\nroom for doubt that what was intended, as Mandela noted at the time, was \u2018an\ninferior type of education, designed to relegate Africans to a position of\nperpetual servitude\u2019. The issue was recognised as being of the utmost\n\n\fimportance; the whole outlook of African children for generations to come\nwould be affected.\nBut deciding the best course of action to take caused deep dis - sension. Some\nchurchmen decided to close their schools rather than submit to the government.\nThe Anglican Bishop of Johannesburg, Ambrose Reeves, shut down all his\nschools, which had a total enrolment of , children. Father Huddleston\ndecided to close down St Peter\u2019s School. In an article explaining the effect of the\nact, he wrote:\nThere is only one path open to the African: it is the path back to tribal culture\nand tradition; to ethnic groups; to the reserves; to anywhere other than the\nprivileged places habited by the master race. It is because we cannot accept such\nprinciples that we are closing St Peter\u2019s. . . . It has been a decision made in\nanguish and only after the most careful thought and prayer. For it means the end\nof forty years of labour and devotion.\nOther churchmen argued that however harmful the system of Bantu education\nmight be, the cost of school closures, leaving thousands of children on the streets\nwithout any kind of instruction and throwing hundreds of teachers out of work,\nwould be too great to bear. \u2018A rotten system of education,\u2019 said Archbishop\nClayton of Cape Town, would be \u2018better than none\u2019. With the exception of the\nJohannesburg diocese, the Anglican Church followed his lead, agreeing to hand\nover its schools to the government. Every other missionary body, except the\nRoman Catholics and Seventh-Day Adventists, took the same line. Whatever\nopportunity there was for the churches to take a united stand against the\ngovernment was lost.\nThe response of the ANC was far more confused. When members of the\nnational executive committee, including Mandela, met to decide what strategy to\nadopt, two options were considered: one was to call for an indefinite boycott of\nschools in an attempt to destroy the Bantu Education Act before it could take\nroot; the other was to call for a temporary boycott. Those in favour of an\nindefinite boycott argued that popular resentment against the act was so strong\nthat their supporters would not be satisfied with a mere protest. Those in favour\nof limited action pointed out that the ANC did not have the means to sustain a\npermanent boycott; it had neither resources nor time enough to organise an\nalternative to government schools and realistically could offer the public next to\nnothing in terms of support. Despite his reputation as a firebrand, Mandela spoke\n\n\fin favour of a pragmatic approach. At the end of a heated session, the national\nexecutive committee recommended a week\u2019s boycott starting on  April ,\nthe date on which the transfer of schools into government hands was scheduled\nto take place.\nThe issue was then put to the ANC\u2019s national conference in December .\nThe dilemma facing the African community was summed up by Chief Luthuli:\n\u2018The choice before parents is an almost impossible one\u2014they do not want Bantu\neducation and they do not want their children on the streets. They have to choose\nbetween two evils and no rule of thumb which is the greater.\u2019\nIgnoring the national executive committee\u2019s recommendation, the conference\nvoted in favour of an indefinite boycott. Strong doubts remained, however, about\nthe wisdom of the move. \u2018To imagine that the ANC has the power to bring about\nsuch a boycott in a few months would be totally unreal,\u2019 declared the left-wing\njournal Fighting Talk. Verwoerd raised the stakes by threatening to ban children\ninvolved in boycotts permanently from school education and to close down their\nschools. In March , the national executive committee, worried by the lack\nof preparation, announced that the boycott would be deferred.\nBut some ANC branches, notably those on the East Rand, were determined to\ncarry on the campaign, regardless of the views of the national executive\ncommittee. Scattered boycotts began in April. Attempts were made to provide\nalternative education at improvised schools known as \u2018cultural clubs\u2019. But the\nclubs lacked equipment, qualified teachers and money and were frequently the\ntarget of police raids. Father Huddleston described one such cultural club set up\nin an empty cinema in Benoni: \u2018Seated at the table was a young African woman\ntrying to demonstrate some game, trying to keep fifty, a hundred children\ninterested, or at least quiet. . . . There was no blackboard; there were no school\nbooks; there were no benches. . . . Such things as would equip a school would\nmake it illegal.\u2019 An African reporter who visited the same club noted how \u2018the\nchildren were unruly and unmanageable\u2019.\nThe campaign soon collapsed in bitterness and recrimination. Only a small\nfraction of parents and schoolchildren were ever involved in the boycott. The\nANC itself admitted that it had amounted to little more than \u2018sporadic, unrelated\nand ineffectual small incidents in various parts of the country\u2019. Critics, like Dr\nXuma, claimed that ANC leaders had acted \u2018for propaganda reasons\u2019 and\n\u2018aroused vain hopes\u2019, in much the same way as had occurred with the\n\n\fSophiatown campaign. But whereas Sophiatown had been a local issue, African\neducation was a national issue of paramount importance to the African\ncommunity. By falling at this hurdle, the ANC suffered a far more grievous blow\nto its reputation.\nAs the government\u2019s opponents had feared, Verwoerd soon moved to reshape\nAfrican education to his liking. In , new syllabuses were introduced for\nprimary schools, emphasising obedience, tribal loyalty, rural traditions and use\nof the vernacular. Vernacular instruction was made compulsory in all African\nprimary schools and later extended to the first class of secondary schools.\nMore was to come. In , the government introduced legislation to\nsegregate universities. Hitherto, South African universities had been free to\nchoose whom they accepted as students. African students had been allowed to\nenrol for degree courses at the \u2018open\u2019 universities of Cape Town and the\nWitwatersrand. They had been admitted to the same lectures and the same\nstudent societies as whites. Now separate colleges were to be provided for\nColoureds, for Indians and for Africans. In the case of Africans, they were to be\ntribal in character, sited in isolated rural areas\u2014one in Natal for Zulu students,\none in the Transvaal for Sotho, Tsonga and Venda-speaking students, one in\nCape Province for Xhosa students. The university college of Fort Hare, which\nhad achieved such a distinguished record in producing graduates since the s,\nwas to be reduced to the status of a Xhosa tribal college.\nIn an article in Liberation, a left-wing journal run under the auspices of\nMichael Harmel, Mandela condemned the legislation as \u2018a step to extend Bantu\neducation to the field of higher education\u2019. Tribal colleges, he said, would be\nused by the government to enforce its political ideology at a university level:\n\u2018They will bear no resemblance whatsoever to modern universities. Not free\ninquiry but indoctrination is their purpose, and the education they will give will\nnot be directed towards the unleashing of the creative potentialities of the people\nbut towards preparing them for perpetual mental and spiritual servitude to the\nwhites.\u2019\nWhat was needed to fight the government, he said, was not a campaign\nconducted on the basis of isolated struggles, but \u2018a broad united front of all the\ngenuine opponents of the racial policies of the government\u2019. THE FREEDOM CHARTER\nFINDING ALLIES IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY WAS AN EXERCISE\nFRAUGHT with complications. During the Defiance Campaign, the ANC had\nsaid that it was \u2018prepared to work with any white man who accepted the\nprinciple of equality\u2019. But while traditional liberals were genuinely appalled by\nthe onslaught of apartheid and the trail of destruction it carved through\nindividual rights and liberties, few were willing to take a determined stand\nagainst the government. Mandela developed a particular dislike for their brand of\npolitics.\nIn May , after Malan\u2019s National Party had won a second election victory,\nwhite liberals launched the Liberal Party in an attempt to bridge the gap between\nwhite and black. By white South African standards, it was a brave endeavour.\nThe Liberal Party opened its membership to all races and advocated the\nextension of full political rights to non-whites. With the exception of the\nCommunist Party, no political party in South Africa had previously gone so far.\nYet its programme was hedged with reservations. The Liberal Party wanted\nnot full citizenship rights for all but \u2018equal rights for all civilized people\u2019\u2014in\nother words, a qualified franchise. Furthermore, it opposed the use of passive\nresistance, strikes and boycotts, rejecting such tactics as being unconstitutional\nand insisting that only \u2018parliamentary methods\u2019 should be adopted.\nIt was also vehemently hostile to having any truck with communists, sharing\nthe intense distrust of communist intentions held throughout the Western world\nat the time. Indeed, one of the motives of the founders of the Liberal Party was\nto provide an alternative to the influence of communists among the non-white\npopulation. All this came with a heavy dose of paternalism, with liberals\nexpressing \u2018profound sympathy with the aspirations of all non-European\npeoples\u2019 but urging restraint, caution, compromise and gradualism on their part.\nMandela vented his anger on the liberals in a June  article in Liberation.\nWith South Africa divided by racial discrimination into two hostile camps, he\n\n\fwrote, there could be no middle course:\nThe fault of the Liberals\u2014and this spells their doom\u2014is to attempt to strike just\nsuch a course. They believe in criticizing and condemning the government for its\nreactionary policies but they are afraid to identify themselves with the people\nand to assume the task of mobilizing that social force capable of lifting the\nstruggle to higher levels. . . .\nTalk of democratic and constitutional means can only have a basis in reality\nfor those people who enjoy democratic and constitutional rights. . . . The theory\nthat we can sit with folded arms and wait for a future parliament to legislate for\n\u2018the essential dignity of every human being irrespective of race, colour or creed\u2019\nis crass perversion of elementary principles of political struggle. No organization\nwhose interests are identical with those of the toiling masses will advocate\nconciliation to win its demands. . . .\nThe real question is: in the general struggle for political rights can the\noppressed people count on the Liberal Party as an ally? The answer is that the\nnew party gives organizational expression to a tendency which has for many\nyears existed among a section of the white ruling class and in the [opposition]\nUnited Party. This section hates and fears the idea of a revolutionary democracy\nin South Africa, just as much as the Malans and the Oppenheimers [a prominent\nmining family] do. Rather than attempt the costly, dubious and dangerous task of\ncrushing the non-European mass movement by force, they would seek to divert\nit with fine words and promises and to divide it by giving concessions and bribes\nto a privileged minority (the \u2018suitably qualified\u2019 voters perhaps).\nIt became clear, therefore, that the high-sounding principles enunciated by the\nLiberal Party, though apparently democratic and progressive in form, are\nessentially reactionary in content. They stand not for the freedom of the people\nbut for the adoption of more subtle systems of oppression and exploitation.\nThough they talk of liberty and human dignity they are subordinate henchmen of\nthe ruling circles. . . .\nMandela\u2019s resentment of white liberals spilled over at a meeting of the ANC\u2019s\nnational executive committee attended by Chief Luthuli and Professor Matthews,\nshortly after they and other ANC officials had held talks in private with a\nnumber of white liberals about the formation of the Liberal Party. Mandela\nrecalled the incident in his autobiography. Along with others who had not been\npresent, he had wanted to know what had transpired. When told that the\n\n\fconversations had taken place on a private basis and were therefore privileged,\nhe retorted: \u2018What kind of leaders are you who can discuss matters with white\nliberals and then not share that information with your colleagues at the ANC?\nThat\u2019s the trouble with you, you are scared and overawed of the white man. You\nvalue his company more than that of your African comrades.\u2019\nMandela was quickly rebuked. Matthews, his old teacher from Fort Hare,\nresponded, \u2018Mandela, what do you know about whites? I taught you whatever\nyou know about whites and you are still ignorant. Even now, you are barely out\nof your student uniform.\u2019 Luthuli replied that if he was being accused of being\nafraid of the white man, he would have no alternative but to resign. Mandela\nbeat a hasty retreat and apologised.\n\nThere were, however, other white opponents of the government willing to\nidentify themselves with the ANC and the cause of African nationalism in a way\nthat white liberals were not prepared to do. In , in conditions of utmost\nsecrecy, a hardcore of communist activists decided to relaunch the Communist\nParty and to devote its energy to the business of liberation. So secret were the\nactivities of the Communist Party that no word of its existence was heard until\n, not even by the Special Branch. Its founding conference in  was held\nat the back of an Indian trader\u2019s store in a village in the eastern Transvaal to\nwhich many delegates were taken in vehicles without knowing their destination.\nThe key working group included Moses Kotane, Yusuf Dadoo, Bram Fischer,\nMichael Harmel and Rusty Bernstein. Although most members were readily\nidentified as being \u2018former\u2019 communists, their involvement in a well-organised,\ntightly disciplined, underground version of the Communist Party was never\nsuspected.\nThey operated mainly in small units of four or five people, meeting\nclandestinely, often in \u2018unmarked\u2019 cars owned by friends and colleagues.\nMeetings of the secretariat took place several times each week. National\nconferences were also held, with delegates attending from towns across South\nAfrica, without attracting the attention of the Special Branch. Among white\ncommunists there were a number of notable husband-and-wife teams: Bram and\nMolly Fischer, Rusty and Hilda Bernstein, Jack and Rica Hodgson, Joe Slovo\nand Ruth First, Brian and Sonya Bunting, and Ben and Mary Turok. In all, their\nnumbers were small\u2014fewer than  members were at the core of Communist\n\n\fParty activity\u2014but the impact they made was remarkable.\nThey were particularly adept at keeping alive a radical press. When The\nGuardian, run mainly by communists since , was suppressed by the\ngovernment in , a new paper, The Clarion, appeared the following week,\nusing the same staff and the same editor; in Cape Town, a former communist\nmember of parliament, Sam Kahn, managed to sell a copy to the minister of\njustice outside the House of Assembly, smiling as he did so. When The Clarion\nwas suppressed, People\u2019 s World appeared; after that came Advance and then\nNew Age, at which point the government tired of the game. During the s,\nRuth First served as the Johannesburg editor of all five papers, as well as editor\nof the radical monthly Fighting Talk. Another outlet for left-wing views was\nMichael Harmel\u2019s monthly journal Liberation, for which Mandela wrote a series\nof articles in the s. All these papers devoted considerable space to\ndescriptions of Soviet achievements and justifications of Soviet foreign policy.\nThe main focus of their efforts, however, was a new political organisation, the\nCongress of Democrats. Launched in , largely as a result of communist\nendeavour, the Congress of Democrats was intended to function as a white\ncounterpart to the ANC and the Indian Congress, in the way that Sisulu and\nTambo had advocated at the Darragh Hall meeting in Johannesburg at the end of\nthe Defiance Campaign. Unlike the Liberal Party, it had no qualms about\ndemanding universal franchise.\nIts membership was open only to whites. By agreement with the ANC, it\nconfined its recruitment to the white community, to avoid competing with the\nANC for black members. But the pool of white sympathisers on which it could\ndraw for support was tiny. Most white opponents of the government were\nattracted more by the incremental, multiracial approach of the Liberal Party than\nby the radical vision proposed by the Congress of Democrats. From its inception,\ntherefore, it became little more than an elite organisation for whites already\ncommitted to the idea of democratic rule in South Africa. Not all its members\nwere communists, but communists played a key role in its foundation and in its\nleadership ranks. \u2018But for them, it would not have seen the light of day,\u2019 Rusty\nBernstein admitted forty years later. \u2018It was communist pressure which got the\nANC to recognise that they had an ally. Communist Party members effectively\nlaunched it.\u2019\nIt was Bernstein who gave the keynote address at the inaugural conference of\n\n\fthe Congress of Democrats at the Trades Hall in Kerk Street, Johannesburg, in\nOctober , urging white opponents of white supremacy to \u2018take sides\u2019 in the\nracial confrontation that was coming and fill \u2018the void in the democratic camp\u2019.\nA veteran member of the Communist Party, who joined in  while studying\narchitecture at the University of the Witwatersrand, he preferred a backroom\nrole, handling propaganda, but was propelled to prominence by the part he\nplayed in launching the Congress of Democrats. Other communists active in the\nleadership included Bram Fischer, Molly Fischer, Joe Slovo, Ruth First, Michael\nHarmel and Cecil Williams, a theatre producer. The president, Piet Beyleveld, a\ntrade unionist, joined the underground Communist Party in , mainly as a\nresult of Bram Fischer\u2019s influence. The post of national secretary was also held\nby communists: first by Jack Hodgson, then, when he was banned, by Yettah\nBarenblatt and then by Ben Turok.\nThe presence of so many known \u2018former\u2019 communists in the leadership led to\nimmediate accusations by the Liberal Party that the Congress of Democrats was\nlittle more than a communist front. The evidence of communist influence was at\ntimes incontrovertible: discussion papers were replete with Marxist theories and\nconcepts, and public pronouncements, notably on foreign affairs, often followed\nthe party line. A war of words between white liberals and members of the\nCongress of Democrats lasted for years.\nThe ANC too found itself under attack for its alliance with the Congress of\nDemocrats, not just from white liberals but from its own Africanist wing.\nAfricanists portrayed the Congress of Democrats as a pernicious fifth column,\nintent on subverting the African liberation movement for its own purposes. They\ndenounced as \u2018Eastern functionaries\u2019 those ANC members like Walter Sisulu\nwho had accepted invitations to attend a communist-sponsored youth festival in\nBucharest in  and subsequently visited Peking and Moscow. When Sisulu\nreturned from his tour of communist countries in , he was greeted by a\nstorm of controversy on all sides. Most whites readily identified him as one of\nthe most dangerous enemies of the state. Africanists nicknamed him \u2018Mao Tsetung\u2019.\nChief Luthuli took a more philosophical view of the role of communists. He\ndeveloped a close personal relationship with Moses Kotane, the Communist\nParty\u2019s general secretary, often seeking his advice. \u2018He knew Moses was  per\ncent a member of the Communist Party,\u2019 remarked Oliver Tambo, \u2018but he also\nknew him to be  per cent ANC, and this gave Luthuli great confidence in\n\n\fhim.\u2019 When Luthuli was restricted to his home area by government banning\norder, he would send for Kotane to discuss ANC issues.\n\u2018People ask me why I work with communists and my reply is that I have one\nenemy, the Nationalist government, and I will not fight on two fronts. I shall\nwork with all who are prepared to stand with me in the struggle for the liberation\nof our country,\u2019 he said. The ANC, he felt, must not be side-tracked by\nideological clashes and witch-hunts. The time would come when conservatives\nand communists within the ranks of the ANC would have to sort out their\ndifferences. In the meantime, he would accept help from anyone subscribing to\nthe ANC\u2019s aims: \u2018We leave our differing political theories to one side until the\nday of liberation.\u2019\nNor was Luthuli unduly concerned about the increasing use the ANC made of\nanti-colonial rhetoric and its applause of the Soviet Union for its role as an antiimperial power. The unconditional support it expressed for the anti-apartheid\ncampaign was welcome. Certainly, ANC leaders had \u2018picked up the language\u2019,\nhe said, \u2018but they learned the language without becoming communists\u2019.\nMandela was later more forthright in explaining his willingness to collaborate\nwith communists:\nIt is perhaps difficult for white South Africans, with an ingrained prejudice\nagainst communism, to understand why experienced African politicians so\nreadily accept communists as their friends. But to us the reason is obvious.\nTheoretical differences amongst those fighting against oppression is a luxury we\ncannot afford at this stage. What is more, for many decades communists were\nthe only political group in South Africa who were prepared to eat with us, talk\nwith us, live with us and work with us. They were the only political group which\nwas prepared to work with the Africans for the attainment of political rights and\na stake in society. Because of this, there are many Africans who, today, tend to\nequate freedom with communism.\nYear by year, Mandela was to draw closer to the communists. His closest\ncolleague, Walter Sisulu, eventually decided to make the leap, secretly joining\nthe party in  and becoming a member of its central committee the following\nyear.\n\nIn an attempt to revive its flagging fortunes and to restore a sense of purpose to\n\n\fthe nationalist movement, the ANC developed the idea of holding a national\nconvention called the Congress of the People to give a vision of the democratic\nfuture it wanted. The idea was first proposed by Professor Matthews, president\nof the ANC\u2019s Cape region, at a provincial conference in Cradock in August\n. What subsequently happened assumed great significance, for not only did\nthe Freedom Charter that was drawn up become a major landmark in the\nconfrontation between the nationalist movement and the government, but the\ngovernment used it as a pretext to try to crush the nationalist movement by\ncharging its leaders with treason. For more than four years, Mandela\u2019s life was\novershadowed by the possibility of a death sentence.\nMatthews\u2019s original proposal was accepted enthusiastically at the ANC\u2019s\nnational conference in December  and he was asked to produce a\nmemorandum to bring the idea into sharper focus.\nThe main task of the Congress will be to draw up a Freedom Charter for\nall people and groups in South Africa. From such a Congress ought to\ncome a Declaration which will inspire all the peoples of South Africa\nwith fresh hope for the future, which will turn the minds of the people\naway from the sterile and negative struggles of the past and the present to\na positive programme of freedom in our lifetime. Such a charter properly\nconceived as a mirror of the future South African society can galvanize\nthe people of South Africa into action and make them go over into the\noffensive against the reactionary forces at work in this country, instead of\nbeing perpetually on the defensive, fighting rearguard actions all the\ntime.\nThree other organisations were invited to join in: the Congress of Democrats,\nthe Indian Congress and the newly formed Coloured People\u2019s Organization,\nbased in Cape Town. In March , the four organisations, collectively known\nas the Congress Alliance, formed a National Action Council, on which each\norganisation had equal representation, to prepare for the Congress of the People.\nTeams of \u2018freedom volunteers\u2019 were recruited to canvass support for the\nCongress and to collect suggestions for what the Freedom Charter might contain.\nThousands of contributions poured in, many written on scraps of paper, pages\ntorn from school exercise books and bits of cardboard, from church groups,\nwomen\u2019s organisations, sports and cultural clubs. The range of demands was\nhuge, covering everything from the right to vote to the provision of proper\ntoilets.\n\n\fMembers of the Congress of Democrats were notably energetic in the\ncampaign, raising concern in some ANC quarters about the role of their new\nallies. Africanist suspicions about white participation were voiced anew. Many\nquestioned why the Congress of Democrats, with a membership of no more than\na few hundred, had been accorded equal status on the National Action Council\nwith the ANC, with its far higher membership. An even sharper reaction came\nfrom the Liberal Party, which refused an invitation to participate in the Congress\nof the People on account of the prominent involvement of Congress of\nDemocrats members.\nBehind the scenes, the influence of Congress of Democrats members was even\nmore crucial. A subcommittee formed to sort out all the bits of paper and to\nprepare a draft version of the Freedom Charter for debate by delegates to the\nCongress of the People included Joe Slovo and Rusty Bernstein. It was\nBernstein, a member of the Communist Party\u2019s central committee and its chief\npropaganda expert, who undertook most of the burden of writing the draft\nversion of the Freedom Charter.\nOnly a few weeks had been left at the end of the campaign for the task to be\ncompleted before the Congress of the People assembled in June . The\nthousands of demands, all stored in a trunk, had first to be sorted into categories\nand topics, like land, employment and housing, before the writing could begin.\n\u2018It was one of the most difficult tasks I\u2019ve done in the political field,\u2019 recalled\nBernstein. \u2018Many of the demands were contradictory. Some people, for example,\nwanted land nationalised; some wanted it redistributed to peasants. It was a\nprocess of gradually and unsystematically selecting what made sense, making a\npr\u00e9cis of them. It was not a scientifically based sample. It was a fairly personal\nassessment. But I also had to keep my own personal preferences out of it. It was\nnot a process I enjoyed. I was uneasy about some of the formulations. Some of\nthem I formulated against my better judgement. In some cases I would\npersonally have taken a more radical position.\u2019\nOne clause, later to become the subject of particular controversy, was\nrewritten at the last minute. In its original version, the general economic clause\nof the Freedom Charter demanded that \u2018the land, the forests, the mines of coal,\ngold, and diamonds, the quarries, the factories and workshops, and the railways\nshould be worked for the benefit of the people\u2019. It added, \u2018The mines should be\nnationalized.\u2019 But a change was engineered by Ben Turok, a prominent COD\nofficial and Communist Party member, who had been given responsibility for\n\n\fpresenting the economic clause at the Congress of the People. Turok\u2019s amended\nversion demanded the nationalisation of \u2018the mineral wealth beneath the soil, the\nbanks and monopoly industry\u2019. It added, \u2018All other industries and trades should\nbe controlled to assist the well-being of the people.\u2019\nThe draft version was shown to senior ANC officials, including Mandela, on\nthe eve of the Congress. \u2018We made few changes, as there was little time and the\ndocument was already in good shape,\u2019 said Mandela. Neither Chief Luthuli nor\nProfessor Matthews had an opportunity to see it beforehand. Luthuli was not\nonly subject to a banning order restricting him to his home district in Natal but\nrecovering from a stroke; Matthews was preoccupied with university business at\nFort Hare.\nThe Congress of the People duly opened on  June  on a rough football\nfield near Kliptown, a ramshackle collection of houses and shacks fifteen miles\nto the south-west of Johannesburg. Nearly , delegates attended\u2014lawyers,\ndoctors, clergymen, trade unionists, city workers, and peasants\u2014including \nIndians,  Coloureds and  whites. It was a multiracial gathering unique in\nSouth Africa\u2019s history. Those present felt a sense of excitement and festivity. It\nwas also an occasion notable for the number of prominent activists who were\nabsent, forced to stay away by banning orders. Many nevertheless managed to\nwatch the proceedings from a distance. Mandela and Sisulu, both banned at the\ntime, found a safe place on the edge of a crowd of spectators, hidden from the\nview of Special Branch detectives monitoring the Congress.\nThe plan had been for delegates to debate each clause of the Freedom Charter\nand decide what amendments, if any, were needed. But the Congress only started\nlate in the day, because of the delayed arrival of many delegates, and much time\nwas then taken up with prayers, greetings and an awards ceremony for three\ndistinguished activists, Chief Luthuli, Father Trevor Huddleston and the Indian\nleader Dr Yusuf Dadoo. The following day, when each clause was read out by\nindividual speakers, there was little time left but for their own introductions. Ben\nTurok, introducing the general economic clause, added his own particular twist.\nSpeaking of the mine owners after liberation, he declared:\nThey will not have those lovely big Buicks that they drive around in. The whole\nsystem of the big factories and the gold mines in this country are the enemies of\nthe people. When you walk down one of the streets in Johannesburg, you see a\nvery impressive-looking building, and outside you see various banks. . . That\n\n\fmoney, friends, does not come back to you. It goes to our friends living in Lower\nHoughton [a wealthy white suburb]. Let the banks come back to the people, let\nus have a people\u2019s committee to run the banks.\nAlong with everything else that was said from the platform, his words were\nrecorded by Special Branch detectives.\nClause by clause, the Freedom Charter was approved by a show of hands.\nOnly two sections were left by four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, when the\nproceedings were abruptly interrupted by armed police who surrounded the\ndelegates. Senior officers mounted the platform and presented the chairman, Piet\nBeyleveld, with a warrant to investigate treason. Beyleveld explained to\ndelegates the reason for the police action, told them he had authorised the\nremoval of all papers and documents and asked if they wished to proceed with\nthe Congress. The crowd roared its assent. While police worked their way up\nand down the rows of delegates, searching bags, confiscating documents,\nrecording names and addresses, and taking photographs, speakers on the\nplatform resumed reading out the Freedom Charter.\nIt was a document more notable for its modest content and na\u00efve promises\nthan for any revolutionary intent. The Freedom Charter affirmed the right of all\ncitizens to vote, to hold office and to be equal before the law. It proposed equal\nstatus for \u2018all national groups\u2019 and an end to discriminatory legislation. \u2018South\nAfrica,\u2019 it declared, \u2018belongs to all who live in it, black and white.\u2019 It went on to\nstate that the mines, banks and monopoly industry would be transferred to public\nownership and that land would be redistributed. Other promises included free\ncompulsory education, minimum wages, free medical care and welfare for the\naged. The tone throughout was one of simple idealism. \u2018Rent and prices shall be\nlowered, food plentiful and no one shall go hungry,\u2019 the Freedom Charter\nproclaimed. \u2018Slums shall be demolished and new suburbs built.\u2019 No suggestions\nwere put forward as to how all this would be achieved.\nIn the South African context, however, such sentiments were dangerous.\nWhite liberals deplored the \u2018socialist\u2019 character of the Freedom Charter, arguing\nthat left-wing activists in the Congress had clearly got the upper hand, thus\njustifying their refusal to take part. A prominent African liberal, Jordan\nNgubane, who had once played a leading role in the Congress Youth League,\nclaimed that the Freedom Charter\u2019s ultimate aim was \u2018to condition the African\npeople for the purpose of accepting communism via the back door\u2019.\n\n\fAfricanist critics within the ANC were outraged by the clause declaring that\nSouth Africa belonged to \u2018all who live in it, black and white\u2019. In the Africanist\nview, the only true \u2018owners\u2019 of South Africa were Africans. The Africanists\nclaimed that the ANC, through its willingness to support multiracial objectives,\nhad yielded to the influence of other racial groups like the Congress of\nDemocrats and the Indian Congress. Their journal, The Africanist, asserted that\nthe Charter\ndid not emanate as a finished document from the ANC. It emanated as such from\nthe vodka cocktail parties of Parktown and Lower Houghton [a number of leftwing intellectuals lived in these white suburbs]. The black masses who met at\nKliptown were merely pawns in the game of power politics. The whites who\nwere at Kliptown, apart from the Special Branch, were mainly members of the\nCongress of Democrats. They are part of the ruling class in South Africa . . . they\nare in reality concerned with the maintenance of the status quo.\nWhat the Africanists wanted, instead of the Freedom Charter, was to return to\nthe era of \u2018go-it-alone\u2019 politics and to revert to the goals of the  Programme\nof Action, which emphasised \u2018freedom from white domination\u2019. Nothing could\nbe gained, they insisted, by trying to appease white opinion. The only way by\nwhich white domination would be broken was by black force.\nIn March , at a special ANC conference called to ratify the Freedom\nCharter, the Africanists kept up a noisy barrage of attacks on the \u2018Charterists\u2019,\nwith shouts of \u2018Africa for the Africans\u2019. Luthuli had hoped to use the occasion\nfor a thorough debate about the economic clauses of the Freedom Charter, about\nwhich he and others had serious reservations. But he was obliged to abandon the\nidea in order to close ranks against what he called Africanist \u2018obstructionism\u2019.\nThose who shared his misgivings, he said, were \u2018not prepared to split Congress\non it\u2019. The Freedom Charter was adopted without any amendment.\nMandela had no such reservations about the Freedom Charter. In an article for\nLiberation in June , he described it as \u2018a beacon to the Congress movement\nand an inspiration to the people of South Africa\u2019.\nIt is true that in demanding the nationalization of the banks, the gold\nmines and the land, the Charter strikes a fatal blow at the financial and\ngold-mining monopolies and farming interests that have for centuries\nplundered the country and condemned its people to servitude. But such a\nstep is imperative because the realization of the Charter is inconceivable,\n\n\fin fact, impossible, unless and until these monopolies are smashed and\nthe national wealth of the country turned over to the people.\nHe denied, however, that this would involve a socialist transformation:\nWhilst the Charter proclaims changes of a far-reaching nature, it is by no means\na blueprint for a socialist state but a programme for the unification of various\nclasses and groupings amongst the people on a democratic basis. Under\nsocialism the workers hold state power. They and the peasants own the means of\nproduction, the land, the factories, and the mills. All production is for use and\nnot for profit. The Charter does not contemplate such profound economic and\npolitical changes. Its declaration \u2018The People Shall Govern\u2019 visualizes the\ntransfer of power not to any single social class but to all the people of this\ncountry, be they workers, peasants, professional men or petty-bourgeoisie . . .\nThe breaking up and democratization of these monopolies will open fresh\nfields for the development of a prosperous non-European bourgeois class. For\nthe first time in the history of this country the Non-European bourgeoisie will\nhave the opportunity to own in their own name and right mills and factories, and\ntrade and private enterprise will boom and flourish as never before. . . . The\nCharter offers immense opportunities for an overall improvement in the material\nconditions of all classes and groups.\nMandela was nevertheless clear about the impact it would make: \u2018The Charter\nis more than a mere list of demands for democratic reform, \u2019 he wrote. \u2018It is a\nrevolutionary document precisely because the changes it envisages cannot be\nwon without breaking up the economic and political set-up of present South\nAfrica.\u2019\nThe government thought so too and set out to prove that the Charter\u2019s aims\ncould not be achieved without violence.\n\nThe knock on the door came just after dawn on  December . Armed with a\nsearch warrant, Special Branch detectives rifled through every room in\nMandela\u2019s house in Orlando, seizing documents and papers. They then presented\nhim with a warrant for his arrest. On it Mandela read the words \u2018Hoogverraad\u2014\nHigh Treason\u2019. As his children watched, he was driven away in a police car.\nAt Marshall Square police station, he found a number of colleagues also under\narrest; more arrived during the course of the day. In all, the Special Branch\n\n\farrested  activists around the country in its swoop, including almost all senior\nANC leaders, among them Chief Luthuli, Professor Matthews, Sisulu, Tambo\nand Kotane, as well as prominent white activists like Joe Slovo, Ruth First,\nRusty Bernstein, Ben Turok, Jack Hodgson, Piet Beyleveld and a British-born\nsocial worker, Helen Joseph. Many of those arrested had expected it to happen.\nSince the Congress of the People, the police had made more than , raids on\nhomes and offices of activists in search of evidence, and the government had\ncontinued to issue dark warnings about treason.\nFor two weeks, after being formally charged in the magistrate\u2019s court, they\nwere held in the Fort, Johannesburg\u2019s main prison, a former Boer fortress built\nin  on top of a hill near the centre of the city to defend it against the British.\nThe African section there was notorious for its bullying, bribery and harsh\ntreatment of prisoners. Thousands of pass law offenders went through its cells\neach year, emerging dazed and dumbfounded by the experience.\nThe African, Coloured, and Indian male prisoners\u2014some  people\u2014were\nlocked into two communal cells with concrete floors, no furniture and two\nexposed latrines. They were each given a sisal mat on which to sleep and three\nthin, lice-ridden blankets. But far from being daunted by their surroundings,\nMandela and the others relished the opportunity to make contact with their\ncolleagues after the months of living under bans and restrictions, unable to\nattend meetings openly. \u2018Our communal cell became a kind of convention for\nfar-flung freedom-fighters, \u2019 wrote Mandela. A committee was formed to\norganise lectures and entertainment; freedom songs reverberated around the\nprison walls. Their white colleagues\u2014seventeen men and six women, all\nmembers of the Congress of Democrats\u2014were meanwhile placed in more\ncomfortable quarters in a separate wing and provided with mattresses, cushions\nand newly-laundered blankets.\nAs the accused were too numerous to fit into any courtroom, the authorities\nconverted the army\u2019s Drill Hall in Twist Street into a court of justice for the\npreparatory examination of the case. It was a cheerless barn-like building with a\ngalvanised-iron roof which, during the heat of a summer\u2019s day, felt like an oven.\nAt one end of the hall stood the magistrate\u2019s table, with other tables for the\nprosecutors and defence lawyers. In front of the magistrate\u2019s table were \nchairs for the accused, in six long rows. Behind them were placed another \nseats for the public, divided into two groups, one for whites, one for non-whites.\n\n\fOn the ten-minute journey from the Fort to the Drill Hall for the opening\nday\u2019s session on  December, the convoy of police vehicles with the accused\non board was greeted with cheering and waving from African onlookers. A huge\ncrowd at the Drill Hall, shouting slogans and bearing placards inscribed \u2018We\nStand by Our Leaders\u2019, surrounded the vehicles as they swept into the backyard.\n\u2018The trip,\u2019 said Mandela, \u2018became like a triumphal procession.\u2019\nThe court proceedings quickly degenerated into farce. When the accused were\nbrought in, the spectators\u2019 section, though packed, contained not a single\nAfrican. So many whites had wanted to attend that court officials had simply\nmoved them into chairs intended for black spectators. When defence lawyers\ndrew attention to the matter, the magistrate, Frederick Wessel, was obliged to\norder that proper arrangements for black spectators be made.\nNo sooner had the prosecutor, J. C. van Niekerk, begun his opening address\nthan it became clear that hardly anyone could hear a word he was saying. Court\nofficials had forgotten to install loudspeaker equipment. No more than twenty\nminutes into the case, the court adjourned for lunch. After lunch, just as the\nprosecutor was about to start again, the magistrate asked whether any\ninterpreters were available for those accused who did not understand English.\nNone was. So, after two minutes, the court adjourned once more. The \naccused were taken back to the Fort.\nWhen they entered the courtroom the following day, they discovered that a\nhuge wire cage had been erected overnight for them to sit in. They were led\ninside and seated on benches, surrounded by sixteen armed guards. Defence\nlawyers, seeking to enter the cage to consult their clients, were told to talk to\nthem through the wire. Some of the accused, more amused than angry at this\nabsurdity, wrote signs saying, \u2018Dangerous! Do not feed!\u2019 and \u2018No monkey nuts\u2019.\nThe defence lawyers, however, were furious. Maurice Franks, normally a\npatient, polite and softly-spoken man, could scarcely contain his outrage: \u2018Your\nWorship confronts this unprecedented scene which we see before us today, the\naccused caged, as Your Worship sees, caged, one might almost say\u2014I am most\nanxious not to allow my indignation to get the better of the language I use\u2014. . .\ncaged like wild beasts. . . . \u2019 He warned that unless the cage was removed\nimmediately, the entire defence team would walk out of court. The magistrate\nadjourned the case once more, agreed that the cage should be removed and\nordered the front of it to be pulled down forthwith.\n\n\fOnce again, van Niekerk rose to read his opening address. But he had barely\nbegun when there was a new interruption. In the street outside, as crowds of\nsupporters pressed close to the entrance, the police ordered a baton charge to\ndisperse them, causing uproar which overwhelmed the court proceedings. A\nburst of gunfire was heard. Everyone in court stood up; the magistrate hurried\naway. The Bishop of Johannesburg, Ambrose Reeves, rushed out of the Drill\nHall and ran towards the retreating crowd with his hands in the air, appealing for\ncalm. A score of people were injured in the police shooting. The court adjourned\nonce more.\nOver the next two days, van Niekerk completed his reading of the charges.\nThe prosecution\u2019s case was that the  accused were members of a countrywide\nconspiracy plotting to overthrow the existing state by revolutionary methods\ninvolving violence and to establish a communist state. The Freedom Charter, the\nCongress of the People and the Defiance Campaign were all cited as key parts of\nthe conspiracy. The penalty for such high treason was death.\nDespite the gravity of the charges, the accused were then released on bail that\nwas nominal. The sliding scale fixed for bail was \u00a3 for Europeans, \u00a3 for\nIndians and \u00a3 for Africans and Coloureds. They were also required to report\nonce a week to the police and prohibited from attending meetings. Mandela and\nTambo were back in their office the next day trying to catch up on a backlog of\nwork.\nThe court resumed in calmer conditions on  January, with the accused seated\nin alphabetical order, all races mixed up, in curious contravention of normal\nprocedure under apartheid. Among their number were clergymen, lawyers,\njournalists and a member of parliament. Most were clerks, drivers, factory\nworkers and labourers.\nThe defence response to the charges was made by Vernon Berrang\u00e9, an\nimposing figure, much feared for his rapier-like skills at cross-examination and\nsecretly a senior member of the underground Communist Party. The Freedom\nCharter, he said, contained ideas and beliefs that were shared by the\noverwhelming majority of man - kind as well as the citizens of South Africa.\nWhat was on trial was not just the  individuals but the ideas they openly\nespoused. Not only would the accused defend those ideas; they would show they\nwere \u2018the victims of political kite-flying\u2019 by the government to see how far it\ncould go in stifling free speech. \u2018This trial has been instituted in an attempt to\n\n\fsilence and outlaw the ideas held by the accused and the thousands whom they\nrepresent,\u2019 he went on. It was no ordinary trial, but a battle of ideas between\nthose who wanted equal opportunities and freedom of thought and expression for\nall races and those who sought to confine the riches of life to a minority.\nAfter the preliminary exchange, the preparatory examination settled into a\nroutine of numbing monotony. For the first six weeks, the prosecution did\nnothing else but hand in thousands of documents seized by the police in their\nfrequent raids on homes, offices and meetings. All the newspapers, magazines,\nbooks and pamphlets collected over three years were duly produced to the court\nand numbered one by one. Nothing was left out, not even invitations to dinner\nand weddings or letters from girlfriends. A notice over the kitchen at the\nCongress of the People saying \u2018Soup without meat\u2019 was solemnly read, marked\nas an exhibit and handed in. The next exhibit, logically enough, was \u2018Soup with\nmeat\u2019. Extracts from the documents were read out, regardless of their relevance.\nAs the prosecution case dragged on, many of the accused began to lose interest.\nSome took to reading newspapers, tackling cross-word puzzles or playing chess;\nothers just dozed. \u2018The heat beats down in waves,\u2019 wrote Alex La Guma, one of\nthe accused. \u2018Heads nod. Eyelids struggle to keep open. Ears strain to listen.\u2019 To\nbreak the tedium, Mandela often brought a book to read or a legal brief to work\non.\nA succession of Special Branch detectives took the witness stand to read out\ntheir notes of speeches made at political meetings. Many admitted that ANC\nspeakers had often stressed the importance of nonviolence. \u2018In the past four\nyears, I have attended many meetings of the ANC,\u2019 said Detective Wilson\nGumisa. \u2018At all meetings an appeal has been made to conduct the struggle in a\nnonviolent manner. There is also an appeal to cooperate with Europeans. The\nANC people say this at almost all meetings.\u2019\nOthers produced more contentious evidence. An African detective, Jeremiah\nMollson, claimed that he had been able to remember verbatim all the speeches\nmade at a five-hour meeting, recording them word for word when he returned\nhome. Under cross-examination from Berrang\u00e9, he admitted that he had received\nonly a limited education and that before joining the police in , he had been\n\u2018loafing\u2019 for fourteen years. A week after his first appearance, he was back in\ncourt to give further evidence on speeches. Handed his notes and asked to read\nthem out, Mollson puzzled over them for some time and then said that there was\na whole page that he could not decipher. Joe Slovo, conducting his own defence,\n\n\fwas quick to pounce:\nSLOVO: Do you understand English?\nMOLLSON: Not so well.\nSLOVO: Do you mean to say that you reported these speeches in English but\nyou don\u2019t understand English well?\nMOLLSON: Yes, Your Worship.\nSLOVO: Do you agree with me that your notes are a lot of rubbish?\nMOLLSON: I don\u2019t know.\nTime and again, defence lawyers were able to demonstrate examples of\nfabrication by Special Branch detectives. At other times, they had little difficulty\nin dismissing their evidence as gibberish. Some reports of the speeches caused\nso much amusement among the accused that the magistrate felt obliged to warn\nthat \u2018the proceedings are not as funny as they may seem\u2019.\nIn August , eight months after the proceedings had started, the\nprosecution announced it would produce evidence linking the ANC directly to\nplanned violence. Into the witness box walked a confident, bespectacled, middleaged man who said he was a lawyer with a degree from Fort Hare. Solomon\nNgubase told the court he was an official of the Port Elizabeth branch of the\nANC and a member of the national executive who had been present at a meeting\nwhen it had been decided to send Walter Sisulu and David Bopape to the Soviet\nUnion to procure arms for a Mau-Mau type rebellion against whites in South\nAfrica.\nUnder cross-examination by Berrang\u00e9, none of this turned out to be true.\nNgubase was not a university graduate, or a member of the ANC, or a lawyer.\nHe had forged his certificate for a university degree, practised fraudulently as an\nadvocate for several years, served four jail terms and was currently facing\nprosecution on another charge of fraud.\nBERRANG\u00c9: When did you last do an honest day\u2019s work?\nNGUBASE: I can\u2019t remember.\nBERRANG\u00c9: You have lived a life of lies and deception?\nNGUBASE: I cannot be able to check that.\n\n\f\u2018This,\u2019 said Berrang\u00e9, sitting down, \u2018is the sort of witness the Crown brings\nhere.\u2019\nAnother state witness, Andrew Murray, professor of philosophy at the\nUniversity of Cape Town, had a more distinguished background but also fell\nfoul of Berrang\u00e9. Murray was reputedly an expert on communism. After\nexamining various documents like the Freedom Charter and speeches made by\nthe accused, he had no hesitation in describing them as \u2018communistic\u2019. Berrang\u00e9\nchallenged the validity of Murray\u2019s opinion and set out to demonstrate how\ndifficult it was to be certain that a particular comment was either communist or\nbore evidence of communist tendencies. He read out a series of extracts of \u2018the\nsort of statement that communists make\u2019 and asked Murray to identify them. The\nfirst extract concerned the need for worker cooperation. It was communistic, said\nMurray. Berrang\u00e9 then disclosed that the author was South Africa\u2019s former\nprime minister, Dr Malan. He read two more extracts, both of which Murray\ndescribed as communistic. The author of one, said Berrang\u00e9, was Woodrow\nWilson and the other, Franklin D. Roosevelt, both former presidents of the\nUnited States. The climax came when Berrang\u00e9 read out a passage which\nMurray again unhesitatingly described as \u2018communism straight from the\nshoulder\u2019. The author, said Berrang\u00e9, savouring the moment, was Murray\nhimself.\nIn September , the prosecution completed giving its evidence and the\ncourt adjourned. In December, without any explanation, the charges against\nsixty-one of the accused were dropped. Most were minor figures in the ANC, but\namong them were Luthuli and Tambo. As the ANC\u2019s president, Luthuli was\nbaffled about the reasoning behind his release. \u2018The truth is I would be happier\nto see the whole thing through with my comrades,\u2019 he said.\nWhen the court reassembled in January , a different atmosphere\nprevailed. To sharpen up its case, the government brought in a new chief\nprosecutor, Oswald Pirow, a former justice minister renowned for his pro-Nazi\nsympathies, his dislike of Jews and his hatred of communism. Pirow, a man who\nbelieved that Hitler was \u2018the greatest man of his age\u2019, was also a formidable\nlawyer. New evidence would be produced, he said, to show the existence of a\nhighly dangerous conspiracy. It would include an inflammatory speech by the\nANC\u2019s Sophiatown leader, Robert Resha, in which he urged his audience to\n\u2018murder, murder\u2019. Later that month, the magistrate found \u2018sufficient reason\u2019 for\ncommitting the ninety-five accused to trial in the Transvaal Supreme Court on\n\n\fcharges of high treason.\n\nIn its preliminary stages, the treason trial served as a rallying point for antiapartheid activists. The accused became popular heroes. For many blacks, the\nANC emerged as a real force capable of challenging the government. White\nliberals raised their own voice of protest against the trial, fearing that its real\npurpose was to intimidate the government\u2019s opponents of any kind. \u2018Unless\nwhite South Africans defend under all circumstances the democratic values\nwhich they cherish,\u2019 said Alan Paton, chairman of the Liberal Party, \u2018the day\nmay soon come when they lose them.\u2019 A defence fund launched by prominent\nwhites to assist the accused and their families and to help pay for defence\nlawyers received widespread support. In London, Canon John Collins\nestablished a British defence fund which attracted substantial contributions.\nYet the disruption caused both to the accused and to the ANC itself was\nsevere. Many of the accused lost their livelihoods during the proceedings and\nsuffered much personal hardship. The ANC, deprived of effective leadership,\nfell into disarray. Disputes and dissension, never far beneath the surface, broke\nout anew, threatening to wreck the movement from within.\nThe law practice of Mandela and Tambo, once a thriving concern, was\neffectively crippled. Mandela and Tambo attempted to keep it going by working\nin the early morning, in the late afternoon and at weekends. But the practice\nsteadily fell apart, leaving both of them in serious financial difficulties. Added to\nall this, Mandela\u2019s marriage finally collapsed. \u2018THE FABULOUS DECADE\u2019\nWHEN MANDELA WAS RELEASED ON BAIL FROM THE FORT IN\nDecember , a few days before Christmas, he returned home to Orlando to\nfind that Evelyn had finally moved out. Her leaving did not surprise him. What\nhe found most distressing, in fact, was that she had taken the curtains with her.\nThe marriage had seemed irreparable for some time. The long sullen silences\nthey endured were broken only by fierce rows. According to Evelyn, after one\nparticular argument, \u2018Nelson grabbed me by the throat and shook me and\nshouted at me. Some elderly neighbours heard the noise and came in to break it\nup.\u2019 She went to live at her brother\u2019s house in Orlando East for a time but\nMandela suggested she should return home: \u2018I was desperate to save the\nmarriage, even if it meant clutching at a straw,\u2019 she said. \u2018But there was no\nthawing of the freeze.\u2019 She confided in Albertina and Walter Sisulu, both of\nwhom were anxious to help achieve a reconciliation. But when Walter\napproached Mandela, he was told curtly it was none of his business. The only\nresult was to increase Mandela\u2019s anger. \u2018I don\u2019t think Nelson ever forgave me\nfor that,\u2019 said Evelyn. He came home less and less, took his laundry to a cousin\nand started sleeping elsewhere.\nThe rift between them became common knowledge. In a final attempt to\nprevent a breakdown, Evelyn asked first her brother and then Kaizer Matanzima\nto intervene. Mandela\u2019s response to both of them was that he no longer loved\nEvelyn. According to Mandela, he was also presented with an ultimatum from\nEvelyn: he had to choose between her and the ANC. There was no doubt in his\nmind where his priorities lay. After yet another terrible argument, Evelyn left the\nhouse to stay in nurses\u2019 quarters, hoping that Mandela would come to realise he\nneeded her to keep the family together. But this time Mandela never went to see\nher, nor did he send any messages. When he was arrested on charges of treason\nand taken to the Fort, Evelyn visited him only once. It was one of their last\nmeetings. By the time he returned, she had moved in with her brother in Orlando\n\n\fEast.\nTheir children\u2014Thembi, then aged ten years, Makgatho, aged five, and\nMakaziwe, aged two\u2014were all adversely affected by the collapse of the\nmarriage, but the most deeply wounded was Thembi. According to Evelyn, he\n\u2018suffered intensely\u2019. Mandela had taken as much interest in Thembi as he had\ntime to spare. They regularly went jogging together and to the boxing gym. He\ntaught him to drive his Oldsmobile. Mandela was affectionate, but also a strict\ndisciplinarian. A visitor who stayed at the Mandela household, Robert Matji, was\nshocked by Mandela\u2019s severity in dealing with Thembi over an incident\ninvolving a school textbook. \u2018He set about cross-examining his son as if he was\nstanding trial in the Supreme Court,\u2019 Matji recalled. \u2018If we did anything wrong,\u2019\nsaid Makgatho, \u2018we would get a lesson from him that was worse than a beating.\u2019\nAs the marriage disintegrated, Thembi tended to take his mother\u2019s side. He lost\ninterest in schoolwork and became quiet and withdrawn. Mandela rarely\nmanaged to brighten him up. In time, Thembi would become increasingly\nalienated from his father.\n\nMandela first caught sight of Winnie Madikizela several months later during a\nrecess in the preparatory examination at the Drill Hall. Driving past\nBaragwanath Hospital, the main black hospital south of Johannesburg, he\nnoticed a young woman waiting at a bus stop and was immediately struck by her\nbeauty.\nIt was perhaps inevitable that they should have met. Winnie, a social worker\nat Baragwanath, was a close friend of Adelaide Tsukudu, a nurse at the hospital\nwho was engaged to Oliver Tambo; they both lived at Helping Hand Hostel in\nJeppe Street. Winnie had already met Tambo and discovered that they came\nfrom the district of Bizana in the Transkei. Several weeks after that first glimpse,\nMandela was buying food in a Greek delicatessen in Bree Street in Johannesburg\nwhen Tambo arrived with Adelaide and Winnie in tow. Tambo introduced them:\n\u2018Winnie from Bizana\u2019, he called her. The next day, Mandela telephoned Winnie\nat the hospital, inviting her to lunch. \u2018I cannot say for certain if there is such a\nthing as love at first sight,\u2019 wrote Mandela in his autobiography, \u2018but I do know\nthat the moment I first glimpsed Winnie Nomzamo, I knew that I wanted her as\nmy wife.\u2019\nWinnie had arrived in Johannesburg four years before, a shy, unsophisticated\n\n\fcountry girl, to enrol at the Jan Hofmeyr School of Social Work, a college for\nblack social workers founded during the war years. Her childhood in Bizana had\nbeen marked by rebelliousness, harsh discipline and family discord. Her father,\nColumbus Madikizela, was a Methodist mission school teacher, a successful\nfarmer and businessman, whose authoritarian manner and fierce temper kept his\nchildren in fear of him. When he entered the room, they were made to stand to\nattention and allowed to sit only with his permission. He showed them no\nphysical affection, never touching or hugging them. The only physical contact he\nhad, in fact, was to beat them for transgressions.\nHer mother, Gertrude, was also a teacher, with similar views on the need for\ndiscipline. Winnie once described her as a \u2018religious fanatic\u2019. An ardent\nMethodist, she made her children pray at least twice a day in a special private\ncorner of a field. Winnie was regularly locked into a room with her mother and\nforced to pray aloud. Gertrude was also obsessed with physical hygiene and\nmaintained rigid standards of cleanliness and order in the house. Each evening\nthe children lined up for an inspection to ensure that they had washed properly.\nThey had to clean their teeth with ash until the gums bled.\nGertrude\u2019s physical appearance, her light complexion, long hair and blue eyes,\nwas a frequent source of family comment. In South African terminology, she\nwas a \u2018Coloured\u2019, of mixed ancestry. Columbus\u2019s mother, Seyina, never\nconcealed her dislike of Gertrude for that reason, referring to her disparagingly\nin front of the children as a mlungu, a white person. Columbus sometimes joined\nin with his own \u2018teasing\u2019.\nWinnie\u2019s rebelliousness was evident from an early age. Tall and strong as a\nchild, she preferred the company of boys and took up boyish pursuits. She was\noften embroiled in fights and gained a reputation among other children as a\nbully. Arguments usually began when Winnie failed to get her own way. In one\nmemorable quarrel with an older sister, Winnie pulled out a weapon she had\nfashioned from a baking-powder tin with a nail driven through it and slashed at\nher sister\u2019s face, ripping her lip and tearing into the flesh of her mouth. The\nbeating that Gertrude subsequently gave Winnie she remembered for the rest of\nher life. Gertrude regarded Winnie as the most wilful and troublesome of her\nfive daughters and regularly beat her.\nGertrude died when Winnie was ten years old, leaving behind a family of nine\nchildren. Drawn into caring for the younger children, Winnie began to exhibit a\n\n\fgentler side to her nature. At boarding schools at Emfundisweni and Shawbury,\nMethodist mission schools, she lost some of her aggression and showed promise\nas a student. In , at the age of eighteen, she passed her matriculation and\ngained entrance to the Jan Hofmeyr School of Social Work, arriving there in\nJanuary . Her home for the next five years was the Helping Hand Hostel.\nBy the time she graduated in December , Winnie had acquired the\noutward sophistication of a city girl. Tall and slender, with large, dark, luminous\neyes, she possessed a beauty that men found alluring. At college, she proved\nherself a cheerful and competent student, and was well regarded for her\nenthusiastic nature and willingness to help others. She took up sporting activities\nwith the same energy, earning herself nicknames like \u2018The Amazon Queen\u2019 and\n\u2018Lady Tar - zan\u2019. \u2018I solved problems the simple way, using physical force, as I\nhad done way back in my childhood days,\u2019 she explained.\nWhen she was appointed as a social worker at Baragwanath, the popular\nAfrican press\u2014Bantu World and Drum\u2014made much of the story of the once\nbarefoot girl from Pondoland who, with brains, beauty and determination, had\nmade her mark in the city of gold. At Baragwanath, she gained a reputation as an\neffective and dedicated social worker. A young African doctor, Nthatho\nMotlana, recalled, \u2018She was an outgoing personality, laughing a great deal, very\ncheerful and intensely concerned about other people\u2019s welfare.\u2019\nShe was courted for a while by Mandela\u2019s kinsman Kaizer Matanzima, who\nmet her while making an official visit to Baragwanath as a chief from\nThembuland. By coincidence, Matanzima arranged to use Mandela\u2019s house in\nOrlando and his car to take Winnie for a candlelit dinner. On his return to the\nTranskei, he wrote passionate letters to her and she replied. But Matanzima\nappeared to want her for his second wife and Winnie lost interest.\nShe had known of Nelson Mandela by name for some time, not only because\nof his political activities but because he was a patron of the Jan Hofmeyr School.\nShe had once seen him in a Johannesburg magistrate\u2019s court, representing a\ncolleague of hers who had been assaulted by the police. But her own interest in\npolitical activity had been negligible; she took a far greater interest in clothes\nthan in politics. When Mandela telephoned her at Baragwanath asking for help\nin raising money for the Treason Trial Defence Fund from the Jan Hofmeyr\nSchool and suggesting they discuss the matter over lunch, she was overawed. \u2018I\nwas petrified,\u2019 she said. \u2018I couldn\u2019t work for the rest of the day.\u2019\n\n\fMandela was thirty-eight years old at the time, sixteen years older than\nWinnie. He had recently been served with a new banning order, restricting him\nto Johannesburg for five years and prohibiting him from attending all meetings.\nHe was on trial for treason, a charge which carried the death penalty. His law\npractice was falling apart. He was in serious financial difficulty. His family life\nwas disintegrating. He rarely had enough time to see his children. To conduct a\nwhirlwind romance with a twenty-two-year-old girl in those circumstances was\nsomething of an indulgence.\nTheir first date set the pattern for their future relationship. It was a Sunday.\nMandela was at work in his office. He sent a friend to collect Winnie and\ntogether they walked round the corner to an Indian restaurant. Their lunch was\nconstantly interrupted by a stream of people wanting to talk to Mandela. On the\nstreet outside, yet others sought his attention. \u2018Nelson couldn\u2019t walk from here to\nthere without having consultations,\u2019 she remarked later. They drove south of\nJohannesburg to a stretch of open veld. Walking through the long grass, Mandela\ntold her of the difficulties he faced with the treason trial and his hopes for the\nfuture. On their way back to the car, the strap on Winnie\u2019s sandal broke. \u2018I was\nwalking with difficulty barefoot,\u2019 she said, \u2018so he held my hand as my father\nwould hold a little girl\u2019s hand.\u2019 When they reached the car, he said, \u2018It was a\nlovely day,\u2019 and turned and kissed her.\nWinnie fitted in to Mandela\u2019s activities as best she could: \u2018He did not even\npretend that I would have some special claim to his time.\u2019 When he wanted to\nsee her, he would send a car for her or telephone her, telling her to be ready at a\ncertain time. He introduced her to his friends, took her to meetings and arranged\nfor her to meet his colleagues at the Drill Hall. In an aside to Mandela, Moses\nKotane remarked, \u2018Such intimidating and seductive beauty does not go with a\nrevolutionary!\u2019\nA striking couple, they delighted in each other\u2019s company, holding hands and\nsitting together intimately whenever they could. Their relationship was\nextremely physical. On many occasions, Mandela found it difficult to tear\nhimself away. But always there were other demands. Mandela took it for granted\nthat Winnie would follow whatever he decided and rarely consulted her about\nhis intentions. He never mentioned the matter of his divorce from Evelyn. Nor\ndid he discuss it with Evelyn. He merely placed a notice in a newspaper stating\nthat he intended to institute divorce proceedings. Until then, Evelyn had believed\nthat, though she and Mandela had separated, their marriage would remain\n\n\fnominally in place. \u2018I had heard that Nelson was going out with a social worker\nfrom Baragwanath Hospital,\u2019 she said. \u2018It was just one more woman, I had\nthought. He would discard her like he had the others.\u2019 The children, meanwhile,\nhad commuted amicably between her house in Orlando East and his house in\nOrlando West, on the occasions that he was there. The news of his intention to\ndivorce her came as a shock not only to Evelyn but to the children and to many\nof their friends. Winnie was sometimes unfairly accused of breaking up the\nmarriage. Thembi was never reconciled to the divorce.\nAverse to any discussion of his private life, Mandela kept the details of his\ndivorce proceedings to himself. Winnie had no idea that the divorce had been\nfinalised until one day he suddenly suggested that she should visit a friend, Ray\nHarmel, the wife of Michael Harmel, who would make her a wedding dress.\n\u2018How many bridesmaids would you like to have?\u2019 he inquired, by way of\nproposing. When Winnie travelled to Bizana to tell her father, Columbus, of the\nplanned marriage, he exclaimed, \u2018But you are marrying a jailbird!\u2019\nThe wedding took place in Bizana on  June , a year after they had first\nmet. Mandela had to obtain special permission to leave Johannesburg for six\ndays. The ceremony was held at a local church, with Winnie wearing a wedding\ngown of white satin, made for her by Ray Harmel. At a reception at the Bizana\nTown Hall, Columbus spoke of his love for his daughter and of Mandela\u2019s\ndangerous career as a politician. He expressed deep foreboding for the future:\n\u2018This marriage will be no bed of roses; it is threatened from all sides and only\nthe deepest love will preserve it.\u2019 He advised his daughter, \u2018Be like your\nhusband, become like his people and as one with them. If they be witches,\nbecome one with them.\u2019\nAfter all the feasts and dancing at Bizana, there was no time for Mandela and\nWinnie to travel on to his ancestral home in Thembuland to continue with the\ncelebrations, as custom required. So Winnie wrapped up a piece of the wedding\ncake and took it back to no. , Orlando West, intending that she and her\nhusband would share it with his family on a later visit when his restrictions were\nlifted. It was a journey they never made.\n\nThe juggernaut of apartheid, meanwhile, rolled on relentlessly. Race laws by\nnow covered every facet of life\u2014housing, education, hospitals, employment,\npublic transport, marriage and sex. In public buildings, on trams and buses, at\n\n\fairports and railway stations, in restaurants, hotels, cinemas and theatres, on the\nbeaches and even in the graveyard \u2018non-whites\u2019, as they were commonly termed,\nwere kept separate wherever possible from the white caste. Signs declaring\n\u2018Blanke\u2019 and \u2018Nie-Blanke \u2019 proliferated on park benches, in elevators, in\nlibraries, in liquor stores and in taxis. New laws were added whenever a gap\ncould be closed. In , legislation was introduced making it a criminal offence\nfor Africans to attend church services in white areas without government\npermission.\nNothing was allowed to get in the government\u2019s way, neither the courts nor\nthe constitution. Thwarted in its initial attempts to remove the right of Coloureds\nin the Cape to vote by an Appeal Court ruling declaring the legislation invalid,\nthe government introduced a new bill making parliament a High Court, higher in\nauthority than the Appeal Court, with power to give the final judgement on\nconstitutional matters. When the Appeal Court then ruled that the High Court of\nParliament itself was invalid, the government changed the Appeal Court\u2014\u2018six\nold men in Bloemfontein\u2019, as one minister disparagingly described it\u2014by adding\nfive more judges and by passing regulations requiring a full quorum of eleven\njudges to hear constitutional appeals. It also proceeded to enlarge the Senate\nfrom forty-eight to eighty-nine members, elected on a basis which ensured that\nthe government could obtain the two-thirds majority in a joint session of\nparliament needed to pass constitutional legislation. With the Senate duly packed\nwith its own supporters, in  the government finally succeeded in obtaining\nlegislation removing the Coloured vote and the Appeal Court, filled with new\ngovernment appointments, formally gave its endorsement.\nNew regulations were introduced to curb still further African entry into\n\u2018white\u2019 areas. Under the dreaded Section  of the Urban Areas Act of , the\nonly Africans entitled to remain longer than seventy-two hours in a white area\nwere those who could prove either continuous residence in the area since birth or\ncontinuous work in the area for the same employer for ten years or continuous\nlawful residence in the area for at least fifteen years. If an African failed to prove\nhis right to be present in a white area, he was \u2018endorsed out\u2019\u2014ordered to return\nto a reserve. In , the pass laws were extended for the first time to women,\nprovoking protests in towns across the country. A crowd of , women, led\nby Lilian Ngoyi and Helen Joseph, marched to the prime minister\u2019s office in\nUnion Buildings in Pretoria in August  to demonstrate their opposition,\nsinging a song specially rehearsed for the occasion: \u2018Now you have touched the\n\n\fwomen, you have struck a rock.\u2019 As her initiation into the world of political\nprotest, Winnie Mandela spent two weeks in the Fort in October  after\nparticipating in a street protest against the pass laws and consequently lost her\njob as a social worker at Baragwanath Hospital. None of the protests had any\neffect on the government.\nAll this was dwarfed by the scheme that Hendrik Verwoerd had in mind.\nElected prime minister by his National Party colleagues in September , after\nthe death of Hans Strijdom, Verwoerd cast himself in the role of a leader chosen\nby God and proceeded to act accordingly. \u2018I believe that the will of God was\nrevealed in the ballot,\u2019 he said on the day of his election.\nVerwoerd\u2019s ultimate objective, as he explained it, was total territorial\nseparation between white and black. He acknowledged that this \u2018ideal\u2019 could not\nbe reached for many years. The journey there would be arduous, but it was\nessential that the goal should be clearly stated. Unless white and black were\nseparated as far as possible, the future would hold nothing but \u2018rivalry and\nclashes\u2019 between them. The solution lay in giving each race \u2018mastery\u2019 over its\nown area. Thus the Native reserves would become the homelands of the blacks\n\u2014or Bantu, as Verwoerd insisted upon calling them\u2014where they would enjoy\nfull social and political rights under a system of government suited to their own\ntribal background. Those blacks living in white areas would be accorded rights\nin the homelands too, which was where their real roots lay, and otherwise treated\nas \u2018visitors\u2019 and assigned separate locations. For a period of twenty years or so,\naccording to Verwoerd\u2019s calculations, the flow of Africans to urban areas would\ncontinue to increase. But in the meantime, the reserves would be properly\ndeveloped, and in white areas the government would endeavour to separate\nwhite and black in every sphere of life. The time would then come when the\nflow would be reversed. At the end of this grand design, Verwoerd confidently\nexpected, South Africa would consist of flourishing black homelands living side\nby side in peace with an ever-prosperous white territory.\nVerwoerd\u2019s plans for separate development were far removed from the\nprevious Nationalist strategy of white baaskap, but his purpose was essentially\nthe same: to relegate the African population to a permanently inferior status. The\nkey to his policy was tribalism. By reviving tribal authority and by placing\ngreater powers in the hands of tribal chiefs beholden to the government, he\nintended to establish a new administrative structure for the reserves which could\nrestore traditional customs and practices and keep African advancement in line\n\n\fwith what the reserves themselves required. For most of the century, the system\nof government in the reserves had largely bypassed the chiefs, whose status had\nlong since declined. Verwoerd\u2019s objective henceforth was to use the chiefs as the\nallies of white government, creating small centres of tribally based power on the\nperiphery of South Africa. By emphasising tribal loyalties, he would keep the\nblack population divided. A central part of Verwoerd\u2019s strategy became division\nof the blacks, which would counter the challenge mounted by African\nnationalists, destroy the notion of black majority rule and guarantee the\nsupremacy of the whites.\nVerwoerd had laid the groundwork for his grand scheme when, as Minister of\nNative Affairs in , he introduced the Bantu Authorities Act, which was\nintended to replace the existing European model of administration in the reserves\nwith a structure of tribal authorities staffed by African chiefs and officials\nappointed and paid by the government. No provision was made for any form of\nelected representatives. In the case of the Transkei, tribal authorities were\ninstalled in place of a partly elected district council system. Chiefs were made\nresponsible for the maintenance of law and order and the implementation of\ngovernment measures. Those who refused to cooperate were deposed.\nThe Transkei was crucial to the success of Verwoerd\u2019s strategy. Covering an\narea of , square miles, it was the only African reserve constituting a\ncoherent piece of territory. Its black population of . million was enough to\ngive it credibility as a separate entity. What was also important was that\nVerwoerd had found there a local ally in the business of apartheid: Kaizer\nMatanzima.\nMatanzima saw in apartheid a means both of restoring hegemony for the\nXhosa-speaking people of the Transkei and of satisfying his own aspirations for\npower. Like Verwoerd, he believed in the rule of chiefs. He liked to describe\nhimself as a \u2018Xhosa nationalist\u2019 and was more than willing to forfeit claims in\nwhite South Africa if it meant regaining autonomy for Xhosas at home. Mandela\nspent hours arguing with Ma - tanzima, trying to persuade him to oppose the\nimplementation of the Bantu Authorities Act, but to no avail. In ,\nMatanzima played a vital role in getting the old General Council, or Bunga, in\nthe Transkei, to vote itself out of existence and accept the new system. He was\nduly rewarded. In , he was appointed Regional Chief of Emigrant\nThembuland and was led to expect further promotion. Mandela recalled,\n\u2018Something snapped inside me when he went over to the Nats.\u2019\n\n\fIn , consulting only a handful of his closest advisers, Verwoerd unveiled\nhis master plan. South Africa, he announced, would be turned into a \u2018multinational state\u2019 by fragmenting the African population into separate ethnic\ngroups. The Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Bill provided for the\nestablishment of eight black \u2018homelands\u2019, one for each of the major ethnic\ngroups: North Sotho, South Sotho, Swazi, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa, and\nZulu.\nNo previous attempt had ever been made to implement territorial segregation\non this tribal basis. Hitherto the whole emphasis of government policy had been\nsimply to segregate black from white. Now Verwoerd decreed that the African\npeople were not homogeneous but a collection of separate national groups\ndivided by language and culture. Their roots lay in separate homelands; there\nthey would be accorded \u2018separate freedoms\u2019. This principle applied not only to\nrural but to urban blacks, regardless of how many generations they had lived in\ntowns; they were all deemed citizens of the new homelands.\nVerwoerd\u2019s \u2018new vision\u2019, as it was called, was hailed by the National Party as\nproviding a lasting solution for South Africa. The advantages to whites seemed\nconclusive. The whites maintained unfettered control over their own areas, while\nclaiming to permit blacks equivalent rights in the homelands. The blacks,\nmeanwhile, were divided into separate ethnic groups, inhibiting their ability to\nact as a single community against outnumbered whites. Because each national\ngroup was a minority of the whole, no one \u2018nation\u2019 could claim rights on the\nbasis of numerical strength. Thus the demands for majority rule by African\nnationalists were irrelevant. The problem of urban blacks was solved by denying\nthem any permanent place in towns. In the long term there was the prospect,\naccording to Verwoerd, that the number of urban Africans might be reduced. On\nthe basis of Verwoerd\u2019s calculations, the reverse flow back to the homelands\nwould begin by . All this was to be set in motion in the name of racial\nharmony, peace and security. \u2018The development of South Africa on the basis of\nthis bill,\u2019 said Verwoerd, \u2018will create so much friendship, so much gratitude, so\nmany mutual interests. . . that there will arise what I will call a commonwealth,\nfounded on common interests.\u2019\nMandela took a different view. Writing in Liberation in its May  issue, he\ndescribed the bill as \u2018nothing but a crude, empty fraud\u2019 to bluff people that the\naim was self-government. \u2018The Bantustans are not intended to voice aspirations\nof the African people; they are instruments for their subjection. Under the\n\n\fpretext of giving them self-government the African people are being split up into\ntribal units in order to retard their growth and development into full nationhood.\u2019\nThe burden would fall on millions of Africans, born and living in urban areas,\nwho had never seen the reserves, who had no desire to go there and who would\nnow be \u2018treated as outcasts\u2019. He contrasted the government\u2019s aims with the\nmessage of the Freedom Charter, which declared that \u2018South Africa belongs to\nall who live in it, black and white.\u2019\nThe new system of administration caused deep dissension in the reserves,\nsplitting apart communities and even families. There was prolonged violence in\nthe Hurutshe Reserve in western Tranvaal, in Sekhukhuneland, and in\nPondoland. Chiefs and councillors resisting government authority were deposed\nand deported. Armoured units and aircraft had to be deployed to crush the\nPondoland revolt.\nThe Mandela household was directly affected by these events. Not only did\nMatanzima throw in his lot with the government but so did Winnie\u2019s father,\nColumbus Madikizela, accepting an appointment to serve on Matanzima\u2019s\ncouncil in the Transkei. Both became the target of attack. Madikizela\u2019s house\nwas burned down, his store was burgled and his mother was assaulted. On one\noccasion, he only narrowly escaped his attackers by climbing through a small\nback window. ANC supporters were involved in the attacks. To have her father\nand her husband entrenched in two opposing camps was a difficult experience\nfor Winnie. But life with Mandela was to bring far greater complications.\n\nIt was remarkable, in the circumstances, how much optimism about the future\nsurvived. Since  the Nationalist government had never shown anything but\nruthless determination in pursuit of white supremacy, riding roughshod over all\nopponents who stood in the way. The white electorate, meanwhile, had\ndemonstrated its appreciation by rewarding the National Party with three\nsuccessive election victories, with an ever-increasing majority. Yet ANC leaders,\nconvinced that the handful of whites who supported them represented something\nmore than a fringe of white politics, still placed inordinate hope in the notion\nthat eventually enough whites would have a change of heart about apartheid to\nbring about the downfall of the government.\nThe optimists included Walter Sisulu, who, despite being forced to resign as\nsecretary-general of the ANC and being subjected to a series of banning orders,\n\n\fmanaged to play a central role behind the scenes. Writing in the journal Africa\nSouth in , Sisulu reached this conclusion:\nAs far as the Nationalist Party is concerned, any serious analysis will reveal that\nit has reached its high-water mark. There is no possibility of the Nationalists\ngrowing stronger than they are at present. . . . Already there are signs that the\nedge of the Nationalist blitzkrieg is blunted in the face of the determined and\ngrowing resistance of the people. . . . In particular, the Europeans of the country\nare gradually beginning to see that South Africa has no choice but to follow the\nroad to a multiracial society.\nThese views were commonly held among the African elite. In his essay on the\ns which he called \u2018The Fabulous Decade\u2019, the Johannesburg journalist\nLewis Nkosi wrote of how the cause of racial justice and intellectual freedom\nseemed to be gathering strength: \u2018It was a time of infinite hope and possibility; it\nseemed not extravagant in the least to predict then that the Nationalist\ngovernment would soon collapse, if not from the pressure of extra-parliamentary\nopposition, certainly from the growing volume of unenforceable laws.\u2019\nThe treason trial had its own effect. Not only was the presence of so many\nwhites on trial seen by many blacks as evidence that whites too were beginning\nto turn against the government but the swift reaction of white liberals in\norganising a defence fund for them suggested a wider concern about government\npolicy. \u2018The trial has been an inestimable blessing because it forged together\ndiverse men and women of goodwill of all races who rallied to the support of the\nTreason Trial Fund and to keeping up the morale of the accused,\u2019 wrote Chief\nLuthuli. \u2018In all humility I can say that if there is one thing which helped push our\nmovement along non-racial lines, away from narrow, separative racialism, it is\nthe treason trial, which showed the depth of the sincerity and the devotion to a\nnoble cause on the white side of the colour line.\u2019\nAmong the accused themselves, sitting side by side, month after month, there\ndeveloped an intense camaraderie. It helped that the accused were seated in\nalphabetical order and not in racial groups. \u2018The only place in South Africa\nwhere there was absolutely no colour bar was in the treason trial,\u2019 remarked\nBernstein. \u2018It produced a core at the centre of people who really thought of\nthemselves as a united group. I mean, the treason trial was a sort of family of\ntheir own.\u2019 Luthuli observed, \u2018By the time the preparatory examination had\ndrawn to its close, the sense of common purpose among those who reject\n\n\fapartheid was immeasurably deepened.\u2019\nIt became fashionable during the treason trial for some of the more\nadventurous white liberals in Johannesburg to invite one or two of the more\nrespectable ANC leaders like Luthuli and Matthews to the northern suburbs for\ntea or dinner. Bram Fischer was assiduous in organising dinner parties at\nBeaumont Street to introduce the ANC leaders on trial to white politicians and\nbusinessmen, most of whom had never met Africans on a social basis. On one\noccasion at Beaumont Street, Mandela encountered the judges who were\npresiding at his trial. \u2018We never discussed the trial,\u2019 said Mandela, \u2018but it helped\nto introduce a particular respect by the judges afterwards.\u2019 Luthuli recalled a\nmeeting with the mining magnate Harry Oppenheimer at which he took the ANC\nto task for the \u2018extremism\u2019 of its demands, such as the demand for votes, which\nmade it difficult for him, he said, to persuade \u2018liberal-minded people\u2019 of the\njustice of its demands. Luthuli replied that it was better for white South Africa to\nknow the full extent of African demands rather than be introduced to them\ninstallment by installment and taken by surprise. Mandela met Oppenheimer on\nanother occasion. There was little common ground, but that such meetings took\nplace at all was seen as an example of the rising importance of the ANC in white\neyes.\nOnce he was freed from the treason trial, Luthuli went on a speaking tour of\nmajor cities, including Johannesburg and Cape Town, to talk to white audiences,\nwhom he found notably sympathetic. He even received an invitation to address\nan Afrikaner study group in Pretoria on the subject of African aspirations. The\nmeeting in the Cathedral Hall was interrupted by a group of thirty white thugs,\nwho assaulted Luthuli and began beating up the audience. Lying on the floor of\nthe stage with a chair protecting his head, Luthuli was asked by a concerned\nwhite supporter, \u2018Are you hurt?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019m used to this,\u2019 he replied, scrambling to\nhis feet. Though his head was bruised and his jaw painfully swollen, he\ncontinued with his address. \u2018It was a good and encouraging meeting,\u2019 he said.\nShortly afterwards, Luthuli received a banning order restricting him to his home\ndistrict in Natal for five years and prohibiting him from attending all meetings.\nThere were encouraging signs from other quarters. The Liberal Party,\nadopting a more radical posture, came out in favour of universal adult suffrage\nand endorsed the use of tactics like boycotts. On university campuses in\nJohannesburg and Cape Town, white students demonstrated against new curbs\nplaced on African entrants. Among avant-garde whites, multiracial parties were\n\n\fmuch in vogue; the more daring went in for illicit affairs.\nIn the world of music, a new African jazz style known as kwela gained a huge\nfollowing among white teenagers. Played originally on the penny whistle, a\ncheap, six-hole metal flageolet favoured by African youths in the townships,\nkwela-jazz was developed by African musicians into a fast, colourful and\ndistinctive idiom which became internationally famous. A multiracial Union of\nSouthern African Artists was formed to assist black performers. At Dorkay\nHouse in Johannesburg, it initiated a series of talent contests which grew first\ninto small \u2018festivals\u2019 and then into township jazz concerts which attracted\nenthusiastic white audiences. A performance at City Hall in Johannesburg in\n was packed out. The climax of these efforts came in  with the\nproduction of King Kong, a jazz opera on the life of the heavyweight boxing\nchampion Ezekiel \u2018King Kong\u2019 Dhlamini. With a score by Todd Matshikiza,\nfeaturing singers like the Manhattan Brothers and Miriam Makeba and produced\nand directed by whites, King Kong was a success from its opening night in\nJohannesburg. As Lewis Nkosi wrote:\nThe resounding welcome accorded the musical at the University Great Hall that\nnight was not so much for the jazz opera as a finished artistic product as it was\napplause for an Idea which had been achieved by pooling together resources\nfrom both black and white artists in the face of impossible odds. For so long\nblack and white artists had worked in watertight compartments, in complete\nisolation, with very little contact or cross-fertilization of ideas. Johannesburg\nseemed at the time to be on the verge of creating a new and exciting Bohemia. . .\n. There was a surge of optimism, very difficult to prove founded or unfounded,\nthat art might yet crack the wall of apartheid.\nThere was a similar sense of exhilaration about the advance of African\nnationalists elsewhere in Africa. Ghana\u2019s independence from Britain in \nsignalled the beginning of the retreat from Africa of Europe\u2019s colonial powers\nand the emergence of new black-run states. As the number of African and Asian\nmembers of the United Nations multiplied, so the volume of condemnation of\nSouth Africa\u2019s racial policies rose. Western governments were also becoming\nmore critical. Foreign support for the anti-apartheid movement was seen to be an\nincreasingly important factor. \u2018World attention,\u2019 said Luthuli, \u2018is something\nwhich we of the resistance need and desire.\u2019\nAll this seemed to enhance the moral advantage that African nationalists in\n\n\fSouth Africa perceived they had in their confrontation with the government.\nWriting in Africa South in , Walter Sisulu observed:\nNothing has brought greater credit to the ANC in the eyes of Africa and the\nworld than its steadfast refusal to respond to the vicious persecution of the\nNationalists and their predecessors in the Union Government by a blind and\nirrational \u2018anti-Whiteism\u2019. It has shown the African people to be larger-minded\nthan, and morally superior to, their oppressors; it strikingly refutes the ridiculous\nclaims of \u2018white South Africa\u2019 about alleged African \u2018immaturity\u2019 and\n\u2018unreadiness for self-government\u2019.\nLuthuli also emphasised the moral strength of the ANC\u2019s position:\nHow easy it would have been in South Africa for the natural feelings of\nresentment at white domination to have been turned into feelings of hatred and a\ndesire for revenge against the white community. Here, when every day in every\naspect of life, every non-white comes up against the ubiquitous sign \u2018Europeans\nOnly\u2019, and the equally ubiquitous policeman to enforce it\u2014here it could well be\nexpected that a racialism equal to that of their oppressors would flourish to\ncounter the white arrogance towards black. That it has not done so is no\naccident. It is because, deliberately and advisedly, African leadership for the past\nfifty years, with the inspiration of the African National Congress . . . has set\nitself steadfastly against racial vaingloriousness. We knew that in doing so we\npassed up opportunities for an easy demagogic appeal to the natural passions of\na people denied freedom and liberty; we discarded the chance of an easy and\nexpedient emotional appeal. Our vision has always been that of a non-racial\ndemocratic South Africa which upholds the rights of all who live in our country\nto remain as full citizens with equal rights and responsibilities with all others.\nThe singular achievement of the ANC and its white allies in the s was\nthat they established a multiracial tradition in politics strong enough to withstand\nall attempts by the government to obliterate it. In the long term this was to have\nthe most profound consequences for South Africa. But at the time, the white\naudience they reached was minimal and the signs of change they detected were\nmisleading. In power was a government determined to enforce its rule whatever\nthe cost. \u2018Alas,\u2019 Nkosi wrote of the s, \u2018we didn\u2019t realize how small and\npowerless we were.\u2019\n",
    "1960-1966": " A TRIAL OF ENDURANCE\nTHE TREASON TRIAL REASSEMBLED IN AUGUST , NOT IN AN\nARMY drill hall but in a disused synagogue, with the Star of David hanging\nhigh above the judges\u2019 rostrum. In order to avoid the spectacle of African\ncrowds milling about in the court precincts, cheering the accused as they came\nand went, the venue had been changed from Johannesburg to the more staid\nsurroundings of Pretoria, thirty-five miles away, where popular support for the\nANC was muted. The Old Synagogue there, a large ornate and empty building\nlong since given up by the Jewish community, was one of the few locations\navailable capable of being converted into a \u2018Special Criminal Court\u2019 dealing\nwith ninety-two accused people.\nSince none of the accused lived in Pretoria, the government provided a bus for\nthe journey from the Johannesburg townships where most of them lived. This\nmeant that in addition to the hours they spent in court each day, the accused had\nto endure four hours of uncomfortable travel to get there and back; on some days\nthey spent as much time in the bus as in court.\nTo avoid such lumbering journeys, Mandela often travelled to Pretoria with\nHelen Joseph, whose fast French car was capable of reaching there in an hour.\nAfter spending a couple of hours in the early morning working in his law office,\nMandela would meet Joseph on the Pretoria road, leaving his car on the roadside\nfor his return in the afternoon, when he would drive back to the office to put in a\nfew more hours of work. For amusement on the way, they picked out houses for\nthemselves for the day when liberation dawned. Joseph described Mandela\u2019s\nchoice as \u2018unpretentious and on the small side\u2019. Mandela thought that Joseph\u2019s\nhouse, with its well-planned garden and green lawns, was too bourgeois.\nThe defence team assembled for the trial included some of the most\nexperienced and distinguished lawyers in South Africa. The team was led by\nIsrael Maisels, a former major in the South African Air Force and chairman of\nthe Johannesburg Bar, whose accomplishments as a lawyer were widely admired\n\n\fby the legal profession. In some respects, Maisels was a curious choice. He was\nnot a \u2018political\u2019 advocate; he undertook to lead the defence case on the condition\nthat it was conducted on a legal basis, not a political basis. But whatever\nmisgivings the accused had about his approach were soon overcome. A tall,\nbespectacled figure, with dark hair receding from a massive forehead, Maisels\ndominated the proceedings from the outset, cutting a swathe through the\nprosecution\u2019s case.\nHis second-in-command was Bram Fischer. Fischer\u2019s position in the trial was\nunique. As a member of an eminent Afrikaner family and a distinguished lawyer\nin his own right, with clients who included the giant mining companies, he was\naccorded the highest respect by the Afrikaner establishment. He was also known\nas a staunch friend and ally of the accused, whose home in Beaumont Street was\nalways open to political dissidents and their families and who worked tirelessly\nin the courts on their behalf. His name occasionally cropped up in the\nprosecution\u2019s evidence. What was not known, except to a few of the accused,\nlike Bernstein, Slovo, First and Kotane, was that he was a senior figure in the\nunderground communist movement. Fischer\u2019s quiet demeanour, his courteous\nnature and his boyish, gentle face gave little clue as to the complex life he led. In\ncourt, his manner was equally soft-spoken, almost self-effacing, but he was\ninvariably effective in achieving the results he wanted.\nOther members of the defence team included Sydney Kentridge, Tony\nO\u2019Dowd and Vernon Berrang\u00e9. Mandela was elected to a twelve-member liaison\ncommittee set up by the accused for consultations with the defence team.\nMarshalling them all was Michael Parkington, who was an attorney of\nexceptional ability but who also seemed an unlikely choice: a former Royal Air\nForce pilot and law lecturer at Cambridge University, he was a renowned\nconservative and anti-communist.\nFrom the opening moments of the trial, the defence team adopted an\naggressive strategy. Their first target was the judges sitting on the rostrum. Three\nhad been appointed: Judge Franz Rumpff, who had been involved in the\nDefiance Campaign trial; Judge Joe Ludorf, a former National Party official\nfamous for his defence of a Nazi supporter, Robey Leibbrandt, tried for treason\nduring the war; and Judge Alexander Kennedy, a Natal judge who in  had\nsentenced twenty-two Africans to death in a mass murder trial arising from\ndisturbances following a police raid. Rising to his feet, Maisels asked for the\nrecusal of two of the judges, Rumpff and Ludorf, setting out his reasons why the\n\n\faccused had cause to doubt that they would receive a fair trial at their hands.\nAfter an adjournment, Ludorf agreed to withdraw, but Rumpff did not. Ludorf \u2019s\nreplacement was Judge Simon Bekker.\nTheir next target was the indictment. The indictment charged that the accused\nwere guilty of high treason because they had conspired and acted \u2018in concert and\nwith common purpose\u2019 to overthrow the state by violence. It also included two\nalternative charges of contravening the Suppression of Communism Act. Maisels\nopened with a devastating assault on the indictment lasting nearly ten hours,\narguing that it failed to provide in clear terms exactly what charges the accused\nhad to meet. Fischer followed with a four-hour attack on the two alternative\ncounts under the Suppression of Communism Act, making the same point about\nthe lack of particulars.\nThe court quashed one of the two alternative charges and ordered the\nprosecution to supply additional particulars about the other. The court also\nordered the prosecution to tell each accused how he or she was affected by the\ndifference between allegations of \u2018conspiracy\u2019 and allegations of \u2018concert and\ncommon purpose\u2019. The prosecution\u2019s response was to drop the remaining charge\nof high treason and to delete the words \u2018acting in concert and with common\npurpose\u2019, leaving only the allegation of conspiracy. In October, after further\nprotracted argument, the prosecution abandoned the indictment altogether and\nwas forced to start anew.\nA huge party was held at the Slovos\u2019 house in Roosevelt Park that night to\ncelebrate the event. Towards midnight the house was surrounded by police, who\nswarmed in through the doors and windows, accompanied by journalists from\nthe Afrikaans press, hoping to find blacks drinking illicit liquor. The blacks were\nwell versed at this game and not a single one was found with so much as a drop\nof liquor in his or her glass. The newspaper Die Burger described the celebration\nunder the headline \u2018Many colours at party\u2019: \u2018A party at which whites, natives\nand Indians were present was held in a Johannesburg suburb last night. There\nwere about  people present. White and non-white drank, danced, sang and\nchatted together. The police appeared at . p.m. In many of the motor cars\nwhite women rode with natives.\u2019\nIn November, when a new indictment was issued, the charges against sixtyone of the ninety-one accused were suspended, leaving only thirty defendants to\nreturn to court. This group, the prosecution believed, comprised the most\n\n\f\u2018dangerous\u2019. They included Mandela, Sisulu, Robert Resha, Lilian Ngoyi, Helen\nJoseph, Kathy Kathrada and Duma Nokwe, a young advocate recently appointed\nANC secretary-general. Those relegated to the \u2018second division\u2019 included Joe\nSlovo, Ruth First, Rusty Bernstein, Ben Turok, Piet Beyleveld, Moses Kotane,\nand Professor Matthews.\nUnder the new indictment, the focus of the trial was narrowed considerably.\nThe prosecution\u2019s case was limited to proving the intention of the accused to act\nviolently. Specifically, what was at issue was whether or not violence was the\npolicy of the ANC and its allied organisations. At the core of the prosecution\u2019s\ncase was the Freedom Charter. To achieve its aims, according to the indictment,\n\u2018would necessarily involve the overthrow of the State by violence\u2019.\nWhen the trial reassembled in January , the defence immediately asked\nfor the new indictment to be dismissed as inadequate. The argument over the\nindictment continued for month after month. But this time the court eventually\nallowed it to proceed. In May , two and a half years after Mandela and the\nother accused were arrested, the minister of justice commented: \u2018This trial will\nbe proceeded with, no matter how many millions of pounds it costs. . . . What\ndoes it matter how long it takes?\u2019\n\nMandela\u2019s home life, meanwhile, was lived in fragments, as Winnie soon\ndiscovered. Not only were there the relentless demands of the treason trial in\nPretoria and Mandela\u2019s constant struggle to keep his law practice alive in\nJohannesburg, but he was constantly involved in political meetings and\ndiscussions. He spent as little time at home with Winnie as he had with Evelyn,\nthough the enjoyment was far greater. His routine was much the same. He rose\nbefore dawn, went for an early-morning run, welcoming the emptiness of the\nstreets at that time, and had a quick breakfast of toast and orange juice before\nheading for the city. He returned home at night, often in the company of\ncolleagues. \u2018He would come home from court and say, \u201cDarling, I brought my\nfriends here to taste your lovely cooking,\u201d and he would pitch up with ten people\nand we would have one chop in the fridge,\u2019 Winnie recalled. \u2018I used to be\nreduced to tears and he would laugh and run around looking for a packet of\ntinned fish from the local shops.\u2019 Money was always tight and much depended\non Winnie\u2019s earnings as a social worker. Even when they were alone together,\nthere were frequent interruptions from people seeking advice and help. \u2018There\n\n\fnever was any kind of life that I can recall as family life, a young bride\u2019s life,\nwhere you sit with your husband and dream dreams of what life might have\nbeen, even if we knew that it would never be like that.\u2019\nTheir moments for relaxation were few. Mandela was selective about which\nparties he went to: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t just go to any party. In fact, I missed most of the\nparties that were held in Bram\u2019s house and in Joe Slovo\u2019s house.\u2019 On Sunday\nevenings they sometimes went to Uncle Joe\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Fordsburg to listen to jazz\nmusicians like Dollar Brand and Kippie Moeketsi. They would occasionally eat\nat Indian restaurants to indulge Mandela\u2019s passion for curry. Mandela also found\ntime to try to teach Winnie how to drive his car, though, inevitably, it ended in a\nrow. On Saturday mornings he would take his three children to a cinema in\nFordsburg, leaving them there while he rushed off on another mission.\nLife at no. , Orlando West, was nevertheless relatively comfortable. The\nhouse possessed electricity, hot water, an indoor bathroom and a telephone.\nMandela\u2019s small study, partitioned off from the front room and furnished with\nthree cane chairs, a couch, a bookshelf, a display cabinet and a huge picture of\nLenin, provided a retreat into which he enjoyed settling. To add to the comfort,\nWinnie added two rooms, decorated the house in new colours and improved the\nsmall garden.\nThe interruptions, however, never ended. One night, soon after they were\nmarried, there was a sudden, violent banging on the front door. \u2018I was convinced\nsomething terrible must have happened,\u2019 said Winnie. \u2018But Nelson, who was\nwide awake and out of bed in an instant, told me not to be alarmed\u2014it was only\na police raid. They were banging with their truncheons, flashing bright torches\nthrough the windows, shouting at us to open up and making enough noise to\nwaken the whole neighbourhood.\u2019\nShe found the experience repugnant as well as frightening:\nThere were these coarse Boer policemen thumbing through our personal\nbelongings, pulling books off shelves, turning drawers of clothing upside down,\nreading our letters, rough-handling our possessions and all the time passing\nderogatory and derisory remarks about kaffirs. And it was all for nothing. They\ncouldn\u2019t find anything incriminating. After they had gone we tidied up the mess\nand I made coffee before we went back to bed. Nelson warned me I would have\nto get used to raids like that.\nOn  February , their first daughter, Zenani, was born in Baragwanath\n\n\fHospital. Mandela was away in Pretoria at the time, attending the treason trial.\n\nIn August , the real trial began. The accused were able for the first time to\nplead not guilty. The chief prosecutor, Oswald Pirow, then set out his case. The\nessence of the crime of high treason, he said, was \u2018hostile intent\u2019. Such intent\nwas evident in the demands of the accused for full equality. They knew that to\nachieve the demands of the Freedom Charter \u2018in their lifetime\u2019 would \u2018inevitably\nresult in a violent collision with the state resulting in its subversion\u2019. The\nCongress alliance, he said, was part of an international communist-inspired\nmovement which was \u2018pledged to overthrow by violence all governments in\nnon-communist countries where sections of the population did not have equal\npolitical and economic rights\u2019. The essential element of hostility was to be found\nin all the facts: \u2018Insistence upon violence runs through the case in an unbroken\nthread.\u2019 The speeches made by the accused \u2018bristle with references to the spilling\nof blood\u2019.\nFor the next two months, the prosecution, repeating the tedious process\nadopted at the preparatory examination, submitted more than , documents\u2014\nbooks, pamphlets, magazines, newspapers, letters, bulletins and circulars\u2014\nseized during the course of , police raids. Some were read into the record in\nfull, some in part, while the accused sat in a half-doze. Once again, Special\nBranch detectives gave their evidence and, once again, the defence team pointed\nout its inaccuracies and unreliability. In all,  police witnesses took the stand.\nThe accused complained that they could not properly hear much of the\nproceedings and used to joke that they could all be hanged \u2018for what we didn\u2019t\nsay, for what we didn\u2019t do\u2014and now for what we can\u2019t hear!\u2019\nOnce again, the prosecution produced its expert witness on communism,\nProfessor Andrew Murray, undeterred by the humiliation he had received at the\npreparatory examination. Murray spent days analysing speeches and documents\nwritten by defendants, concluding that they were communist-inspired. But under\nrelentless cross-examination by Maisels, he was eventually obliged to admit that\nthe accused were motivated not by communism but by grievances over\napartheid.\nMAISELS: It is clear, is it not, Professor, to summarize this position, that\nthe laws of the white man\u2014and I use that not meaning of this\ngovernment but of successive South African governments \u2014all these\n\n\flaws in which the black man has, and has had, no say, are such that for a\nNative and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the Indian and the Coloured\u2014\nthey prescribe, and just listen to this catalogue, where he may live.\nCorrect?\nMURRAY: Yes.\nMAISELS: Where he may work?\nMURRAY: Yes.\nMAISELS: What work he may do?\nMURRAY: Yes.\nMAISELS: What he is to get paid?\nMURRAY: Yes.\nMAISELS: What schools he may go to?\nMURRAY: Yes.\nMAISELS: Where he may travel to in South Africa, in his own country?\nMURRAY: Yes.\nMAISELS: In these circumstances, do you not think that the Native may\nwell regard himself as oppressed and exploited by the white man?\nMURRAY: I think in certain spheres of life, yes.\nMurray finally agreed that the Freedom Charter was not a \u2018communist\u2019\ndocument but a natural and understandable reaction to the injustices of white\nsupremacy. Maisels concluded, \u2018We know, of course, as a fact that no single act\nof violence was committed over the whole period of this indictment by any [of\nthe accused], notwithstanding all the grievances and the exploitation of\ngrievances. You know that, don\u2019t you, Professor?\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Murray replied.\n\nThere was, however, one piece of evidence not so easy for the defence team to\nhandle. In January , the prosecution produced a tape-recording of the\nspeech made by Robert Resha to a group of \u2018freedom volunteers\u2019 at a closed\nmeeting at ANC headquarters in Johannesburg, recorded by a microphone\n\n\fhidden in the ceiling, thirteen days before the accused were arrested in\nDecember . \u2018When you are disciplined and you are told by the organization\nnot to be violent, you must not be violent,\u2019 Resha had said, but \u2018if you are a true\nvolunteer and you are called upon to be violent, you must be absolutely violent,\nyou must murder! Murder! That is all.\u2019 Here, said the prosecution, was the true\nand secret face of the ANC, unmasked of its public pretence of non-violence.\nOn  March , the prosecution closed its case. On  March , the\ndefence case began. But the defence team had hardly got into their stride when a\nsudden upheaval occurred that brought the trial proceedings to a halt and shook\nthe country to its core.\n\nThe name of Sharpeville was to leave an indelible stain on South Africa. What\ntook place there on  March  became a permanent symbol of the brutality\nof the apartheid regime. The impact was felt around the world. Never before had\nSouth Africa faced such universal condemnation.\nThe events of that day centred not on the ANC but on a rival organisation, the\nPan-Africanist Congress, which had been launched the previous year by a\nsplinter group of dissident Africanists. Its leader, Robert Sobukwe, a thirty-fiveyear-old instructor in African languages at the University of the Witwatersrand,\nwas convinced that he would gain a mass following by promising African rule.\nHe rejected the idea of white participation in government, derided\n\u2018multiracialism\u2019 as a device to keep blacks in subjection and denounced\ncommunism and communist influence. He placed great faith in the idea of heroic\nleadership. Once the masses were given bold, decisive leadership, he believed,\nthen the fires of rebellion could soon be lit. With mass support, African rule, he\nclaimed, could be attained in four years.\nThough Mandela had once shared many of the views held by Africanists, he\nnow regarded that as an adolescent phase in his political life. He dismissed PAC\npolicies as \u2018immature\u2019 and \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 and abhorred the crude racist statements made\nby its more extreme officials. The freedom struggle, he said, required\ncompromise and discipline, not empty rhetoric which ignored the complex\nrealities of South Africa.\nSisulu launched a ferocious public attack on the Africanists, describing their\n\u2018inverted racialism\u2019 as akin to that of the ruling National Party. But while\n\n\fscorning them as \u2018armchair revolutionaries\u2019, Sisulu was nevertheless mindful of\nthe effect they might have. \u2018There are men and women amongst them who\ngenuinely believe that the salvation of our people lies in a fanatical African\nracialism and denunciation of everything that is not African,\u2019 he said. \u2018And such\na policy is not without its potential mass appeal.\u2019\nFrom the outset, the PAC, like the ANC, possessed no coherent strategy. It\nwas poorly organised, short of funds and trained leaders and relied on little more\nthan the notion that the time was ripe for militant action. But determined to force\nthe pace and establish the PAC\u2019s credentials as the leading nationalist group,\nSobukwe devised plans for a campaign of mass protest against the pass laws.\nThe slogans chosen were \u2018Leaders in Front\u2019 and \u2018No Bail, No Defence, No\nFine\u2019. By swamping the prison system, they would make the pass laws\nunworkable. The campaign, he believed, would disrupt the economy and\neventually inspire a popular uprising.\nThough few preparations had been made, Sobukwe announced that the\ncampaign would begin on  March. On that date, PAC supporters would\npresent themselves at police stations for arrest. They would say, \u2018We do not have\npasses. We will not carry passes again. Millions of our people have been arrested\nunder pass laws, so you had better arrest us all now.\u2019 They would not return to\nwork until their demands were met. This would be the first step to freedom in\n.\n\nThe PAC\u2019s campaign that day was largely a failure. In the early morning, after\nputting his papers in order and making last-minute arrangements for the welfare\nof his family, Sobukwe began the three-mile walk from his home to Orlando\npolice station, being joined along the way by small groups of PAC supporters. In\nall, about  volunteers presented themselves for arrest in Johannesburg, an\ninsignificant number. At Pretoria\u2019s Hercules police station, six men arrived\nexpecting arrest, only to have their names taken and to be sent away. In Durban,\nPort Elizabeth and East London there were no demonstrations at all.\nBut in Sharpeville, a township in southern Transvaal, the response was much\ngreater. From early in the morning, PAC pickets were active on the streets,\ntelling residents they should not go to work. By mid-morning, a crowd of several\nthousand Africans had gathered outside the police station. Their mood,\naccording to most accounts, was relaxed and amiable. But they showed no signs\n\n\fof dispersing. Police reinforcements were called in. At . p.m., by which time\nnearly  police were facing a crowd of some , Africans, a scuffle broke\nout near one of the gates to the police compound. A police officer was pushed\nover. The crowd surged forward to see what was happening. According to police\nwitnesses, stones were thrown at them. No order was given to shoot. No warning\nshots were fired. In a moment of panic, the police opened fire indiscriminately\ninto the crowd. The crowd turned and fled. But still the firing continued. Sixtyseven Africans were killed and  wounded. Most were shot in the back.\nLater in the day, a similar incident, though on a smaller scale, occurred in\nLanga, a black township outside Cape Town occupied mainly by migrant\nworkers. Confronted by a crowd of , Africans, police mounted baton\ncharges to break it up. The crowd retaliated by throwing stones. The police\nopened fire, killing two Africans and injuring forty-nine others. That night\nrioting broke out in the township. The Langa protest then turned into a major\nconfrontation with the authorities in Cape Town. A strike which began that day\neventually spread until almost all African workers in Cape Town joined it,\nbringing industry to a standstill.\n\nAt the treason trial in Pretoria that day, Chief Luthuli was on the witness stand,\ngiving evidence for the defence about the ANC\u2019s policy of non-violence. His\nbanning order restricting him to his home district in Natal had been lifted to\nenable him to travel to Pretoria, where he was staying at the home of white\nfriends. But he was suffering from high blood pressure and the state of his health\nwas a cause of constant concern.\nAs the full extent of the shooting at Sharpeville and Langa became clear, a\nsmall group consisting of Mandela, Sisulu, Slovo and Duma Nokwe held an allnight meeting in Johannesburg to plan what response to make. There was\nconsiderable anger at the PAC\u2019s precipitate action in launching its campaign\nwithout proper preparation. \u2018It was a blatant case of opportunism,\u2019 said Mandela.\n\u2018Their actions were motivated more by a desire to eclipse the ANC than to defeat\nthe enemy.\u2019 In just one day, the PAC, hitherto an insignificant splinter group,\nhad captured national and international attention. Yet it had neither the means\nnor the ability to make any further moves, or manage the surge of black anger\nthat now followed.\nThe leadership of the crisis thus fell to the ANC. Mandela\u2019s group decided to\n\n\fcall for a national stay-away on  March, to mark it as a day of mourning and to\ninitiate a campaign of pass-burning. Duma Nokwe was sent to Pretoria to gain\nLuthuli\u2019s approval. On  March, Luthuli duly announced a day of mourning on\n March and publicly burned his pass, calling on others to do the same.\nMandela burned his pass in Orlando before a crowd of press photographers and\nseveral hundred onlookers. The response to the strike call two days later in many\nlarge towns was overwhelming. In demonstrations across the country, thousands\nof Africans burned their pass books. Violence broke out in Johannesburg\u2019s black\nsuburbs. In Langa, police brutality in trying to break the week-long strike\nprovoked a mass march by some , Africans into the centre of Cape Town.\nMany blacks believed that they were on the verge of liberation.\nTo much of the white population, it seemed that South Africa had indeed\nreached a critical turning point. The sight of massed ranks of blacks marching on\nthe centre of a white city suggested that black patience had finally snapped. As\nfear and alarm about the defiant mood of the black population spread, whites\nrushed to gunshops in the Transvaal and in Cape Town, clearing out their stocks.\nHouse prices and the stock market slumped. Foreign embassies were inundated\nwith inquiries about immigration. Liberal whites were convinced that the\ngovernment would now have no alternative but to change its policies.\nAn outburst of international protest against the Sharpeville killings added to\nthe atmosphere of crisis. Photographs of the shooting, published by newspapers\naround the world, made a sharp impact on millions of people who saw them. In\nthe following days, as reports of demonstrations, marches and police brutality\naccumulated, the impression gained abroad was of an evil regime in the throes of\ncrisis so severe that it might not survive. Western attitudes towards South Africa\nbecame markedly more hostile. A United Nations Security Council resolution\nblamed South Africa\u2019s racial policies for causing \u2018international friction\u2019. In a\nGeneral Assembly debate, British delegates, who had previously stuck to the\nargument that South Africa\u2019s racial policies were its own internal affair, now\nopenly attacked apartheid. The United States added its own condemnation. For\nthe first time, the General Assembly approved a resolution not just expressing\nabhorrence of South African policies but asking for action to be taken. Foreign\ninvestors, meanwhile, fearing imminent upheaval, took their own action. A sharp\noutflow of capital hit the value of the currency and halved its foreign exchange\nreserves.\nTo all criticism, both domestic and foreign, Verwoerd remained impervious.\n\n\fNothing was to shake his faith in apartheid. The British prime minister, Harold\nMacmillan, who paid a visit to South Africa shortly before Sharpeville in\nFebruary , held long private discussions with Verwoerd, endeavouring to\nexplain the consequences of \u2018the wind of change\u2019 blowing through Africa but\nmaking no headway. As he recalled in his memoirs:\nIt was only during these days that I began to realize to the full extent the degree\nof obstinacy, amounting really to fanaticism, which Dr Verwoerd brought to the\nconsideration of his policies. . . . I had the unusual experience of soon noticing\nthat nothing one could say or put forward would have the smallest effect upon\nthe views of this determined man.\nFar from being willing to make concessions, Verwoerd ordered a massive\ncrackdown on his opponents. In parliament on  March, the government\nintroduced new security legislation, the Unlawful Organizations Act,\nempowering it to proscribe the ANC, the PAC and any other organisations\nattempting to further their aims. Government spokesmen claimed that the\nnationalist parties were determined on the violent overthrow of the government.\n\u2018Their aim,\u2019 said the minister of justice, Fran\u00e7ois Erasmus, on  March, \u2018is to\nbring to its knees any white government in South Africa which stands for white\nsupremacy and for white leadership. . . . [They] do not want peace and order . . .\nwhat they want is our country.\u2019 Armed with this new legislation, said Erasmus,\nthe government would be able to protect innocent Africans and bring an end to\nthe ANC-PAC \u2018reign of terror\u2019.\nOn  March, the government declared a state of emergency and began to\nround up hundreds of anti-apartheid dissidents. Officials were empowered to\narrest suspects without warrants and to detain them indefinitely. Large-scale\npolice raids were conducted in one township after another. In Langa, police units\nthrew a cordon around the township, cut off water and electricity supplies, then\nstaged house-to-house raids, dragging men and women on to the streets and\nassaulting them with clubs and whips. Four days of continuous brutality\neventually broke the strike.\nThe knock on Mandela\u2019s door at no. , Orlando West, came at . in the\nmorning on  March. A posse of armed Special Branch policemen ransacked\nthe house, searching for papers and confiscating everything they found,\nincluding transcripts Mandela had recently made of his mother\u2019s recollections of\nfamily history which he was never to see again. The police possessed no warrant\n\n\ffor his arrest, gave him no opportunity to contact a lawyer and refused to tell\nWinnie where he was being taken. \u2018I simply nodded at Winnie; it was no time\nfor words of comfort.\u2019\nAt Newlands police station, close to the old site of Sophiatown, Mandela\nfound a number of colleagues also under arrest, including Sisulu, Resha and\nNokwe. A group of about forty men in all were packed into a small, open yard\nand left standing for the rest of the night without food or blankets. In the\nmorning they were moved into a small cell where the only toilet facility was a\nsingle drainage hole in the floor which soon became blocked. The stench was\noverpowering. Still they were given no food or water.\nWhen the cell door was next opened, the prisoners surged through it into an\nadjacent courtyard and refused to move until they had been fed. The station\ncommander, called to the scene, berated Mandela for standing with his hands in\nhis pockets. At  p.m., food finally arrived. At  p.m., prisoners were given\nsleeping mats and blankets encrusted with dried vomit and ridden with lice, the\nstench of which was so foul that the prisoners retched in disgust.\nThe next morning, when the station commander accused him of being\n\u2018cheeky\u2019, Mandela nearly came to blows with him. \u2018I was still raving mad with\ntemper when in came Special Branch detective Sergeant Helberg and says,\n\u201cHello, Nelson!\u201d in a pleasant way. \u201cI am not Nelson to you, I am Mr Mandela!\u201d\nI shouted.\u2019 By this time tempers all round were running high. Before matters\ndegenerated further, Mandela was told he was to be taken to Pretoria to attend\nthe treason trial. \u2018Fortunately we were told to get into a truck,\u2019 he said.\nOne week later, the ANC and the PAC were declared illegal organisations. As\nthe government sought to crush all resistance, wave after wave of arrests took\nplace. Few dissidents escaped the dragnet. Oliver Tambo was driven across the\nborder into Bechuanaland (later Botswana) to establish external links for the\nANC. The Indian communist leader, Yusuf Dadoo, also went into exile. Ruth\nFirst, disguised in a red wig, escaped with her children to Swaziland. A small\nCommunist Party committee, including Michael Harmel, Moses Kotane and Ben\nTurok, continued to operate underground in Johannesburg, moving from one\nhide-out to another, evading arrest. But scores of other prominent activists, even\nLiberal Party members, were incarcerated. The PAC\u2019s headquarters in\nJohannesburg were left in the hands of a student who previously had been\nworking as an office manager. By the beginning of May, the total number of\n\n\farrests had reached more than ,.\nBut for the shooting at Sharpeville, the day might have marked no more than\nanother abortive episode in the annals of African protest. The poor response to\nthe PAC\u2019s call for mass civil disobedience showed how few were ready to seek\nthe confrontation with white power that Sobukwe told them would result in the\ngovernment\u2019s downfall. Not only did Sobukwe misjudge popular reaction to his\ncampaign; he also entirely underestimated the government\u2019s real strength and its\npowers of repression. Though the government was pitched into a political crisis\nof unprecedented magnitude, it was never in danger of losing control.\nBut this was not the conclusion that prominent opponents of the government\nreached. They saw the Sharpeville crisis, the dramatic fall it produced in white\nconfidence and the torrent of condemnation emanating from around the world as\nevidence of a regime that was vulnerable at home and abroad. \u2018The type of\ndespotism we still endure in the Union in this age,\u2019 wrote Michael Harmel, the\nleading theoretician of the Congress alliance, \u2018is a kind of freak, an anachronism\nwhich cannot hope much longer to survive.\u2019 With so few avenues left open for\npolitical action, Congress activists now began to think in terms of revolutionary\nstrategy to hasten its end.\n\nIn the wake of the Sharpeville shooting, the treason trial acquired a new\nsignificance. The government maintained that the demonstrations and disorder\nwere all part of a communist-inspired conspiracy to overthrow the state with\nwhich the trial was directly linked, even though the indictment related to events\nbefore December . The accused took a simpler view of the matter. \u2018This\ntrial,\u2019 said Duma Nokwe, \u2018is out of date.\u2019\nOn the day that the state of emergency was declared, the proceedings opened\nin some confusion. Mandela and seventeen other accused were absent. Those\nwho did attend had yet to be arrested. Also missing from the witness box was\nChief Luthuli, who had been in the middle of giving his evidence. When Judge\nRumpff asked for an explanation for his absence, he was told that Luthuli had\nbeen arrested in the early hours of the morning. Rumpff retorted irritably that he\ndid not see why the state of emergency should stand in the way of the trial and\nordered Luthuli to be brought to court.\nWhen Luthuli duly appeared, in frail health, it transpired that he had been\n\n\fassaulted by a white policeman in Pretoria Central police station. \u2018As we were\nbeing marched to our cells in the dim light of early morning,\u2019 he recalled, \u2018I was\nobliged to slow down to negotiate a flight of steps. I was instantly slapped hard\nacross the face from behind. I stooped to gather my hat, and I was hit again.\u2019 He\nadded, \u2018I was angered, but not surprised. Among Africans, the South African\npolice have long been notorious for this sort of thing.\u2019\nThe trial soon came to a standstill. The following day, with Mandela and the\nmissing accused now present, Maisels asked the court to adjourn on the grounds\nthat the government, by declaring a state of emergency, had effectively made a\njudgement on the case. Moreover, defence witnesses would be fearful of giving\ntestimony which might now lead to their prosecution under the terms of the\nemergency regulations. He questioned the propriety of continuing with the trial.\nThe court was adjourned until  April while the judges considered the matter.\nOutside the court, as the accused milled about being rearrested, one of them,\nWilton Mkwayi, became separated from the others. When he tried to rejoin\nthem, a policeman ordered him to leave. When he pointed out he was one of the\naccused, he was called a liar, threatened with arrest and once again ordered to\nleave. Mkwayi shrugged his shoulders, walked away and went underground.\nMeanwhile, the twenty-nine accused were taken to different prisons in Pretoria.\nMandela\u2019s new home, for the next five months, was Pretoria Local. The\nconditions there were initially as bad as those at Newlands. The prisoners were\ncrammed five to a cell six feet by twelve feet, with a single toilet bucket that was\nemptied twice a day. The air was foul, the blankets and mats were ridden with\nlice and bugs and the food, cold and stale, was doled out on rusty dishes. For the\nfirst ten days, the prisoners were allowed no exercise; nor did they get a chance\nto shower.\nMandela became their spokesman, engaged in a constant struggle for\nimprovements. When he first asked for a separate room so that the accused could\nread and study trial documents in quiet, a senior prison officer retorted,\n\u2018Government regulations don\u2019t require you prisoners to read books.\u2019 But slowly,\nhe gained concessions. The cells were painted and fumigated, new blankets and\ntoilet buckets were issued, exercise periods were allowed and a large cell was\nprovided for consultations and legal books. Over the issue of food, Mandela took\nthe complaint to the court. \u2018Speaking with the greatest moderation,\u2019 he said,\naddressing Judge Rumpff, \u2018it is no exaggeration to say that the food which is\n\n\ffurnished to us in jail, My Lord, with due respect, is completely unfit for human\nconsumption.\u2019 The standard of food duly improved.\nWhen the trial resumed on  April, the judges, accepting assurances from the\nminister of justice of an indemnity for the witnesses, decided that the case could\nproceed. The accused, however, had agreed on other tactics. To make clear their\nprotest against the conditions under which the trial was being held during the\nstate of emergency, Nokwe announced that they would dispense with their\ndefence law - yers. Maisels duly rose to address the court: \u2018We have no further\nmandate and we will consequently not trouble Your Lordships any further.\u2019 All\nthe defence lawyers then walked out. For a moment, the court seemed stunned.\nBut Judge Rumpff soon carried on as though nothing had happened. The\naccused, henceforth, were left to conduct their own defence, with Nokwe acting\nas advocate and Mandela as attorney.\nLuthuli returned to the witness box, looking tired and weary but nevertheless\nresolute under cross-examination. Because of his poor health, his appearance\nwas limited to two hours a day. After giving testimony, he was taken back each\ntime to the prison hospital, where he lived. His ordeal did not stop there,\nhowever, as he was himself charged on  counts for burning his pass and\ninciting others to do the same and faced his own trial. At the treason trial, Judge\nRumpff treated him with great consideration, anxious to avoid any undue strain,\nbut the prosecutors gave him no quarter, attacking his honesty and integrity. In\nall, he appeared in court on twenty-six days and did not finally step down from\nthe witness box until June.\nLuthuli spoke of his belief that moral persuasion and economic pressure\nwould eventually lead whites to change their policies. There still remained, he\nsaid, goodwill towards the whites, though it was diminishing with each year that\npassed. He emphasised the ANC\u2019s policy of non-violence, pointing out that it\ncould be changed only at a national conference. \u2018I have heard no suggestion to\nchange that policy, not a whisper,\u2019 he said. He would have opposed such a\nsuggestion, firstly on personal grounds and secondly because it would be\ncontrary to the interests of the liberation movement: \u2018It is not a practical thing.\u2019\nAs the trial dragged on, week after week, Mandela felt keenly his separation\nfrom Winnie, who was pregnant again, and from Zenani, then a year old. He\nmade the most of what few visits they were allowed to make to see him, holding\nand kissing Zenani if the guards permitted him to do so, but the moments of their\n\n\fdeparture were always hard to bear. \u2018As Winnie was saying goodbye, and the\nguards were ushering them out,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018Zeni would often motion for me to\ncome with them, and I could see from her small puzzled face that she did not\nunderstand why I could not.\u2019\nMandela also managed to arrange a few illicit meetings with Winnie during\nvisits to Johannesburg he was permitted to make at weekends to help wind up\nthe affairs of Mandela and Tambo. Accompanied by a Special Branch detective,\nhe would leave Pretoria once the court proceedings had ended, work in his office\nduring the day and spend his nights in a Marshall Square police cell, before\nreturning to Pretoria Local on Sunday. The Special Branch detective, an\naccommodating man, allowed him to buy items from a nearby caf\u00e9 on his own\nand discreetly turned away when Winnie made an appearance. \u2018We had a kind of\ngentleman\u2019s code between us: I would not escape and thereby get him into\ntrouble, while he permitted me a degree of freedom.\u2019\nOn  August, with defence lawyers back in court as a result of a relaxation of\nthe emergency regulations, Mandela finally took the witness stand. Winnie was\npresent to watch him. Under the guidance of Sydney Kentridge, he was asked to\nexplain at length about the history of the ANC and its policies, about the Youth\nLeague, the Defiance Campaign, the \u2018M\u2019 Plan, the Congress of the People and\nthe Freedom Charter. He was also questioned about his views on communism,\ncapitalism and imperialism, about speeches he had given, articles he had written\nand books found in his possession. Kentridge\u2019s aim was to concentrate on issues\nthat he knew the prosecutors would subsequently try to exploit in their efforts to\nestablish the involvement of the ANC in violence and hence to pre-empt them.\nOnce Mandela had stated his case, the burden would be on the prosecution to\nprove otherwise. His evidence took up  pages of the official record.\nKentridge began by examining Mandela on the Youth League, drawing\nattention to its anti-communist stand to demonstrate that the ANC\u2019s outlook was\nrooted not in communism but in a broader spectrum of views. Mandela related\nhis own reasons for supporting a resolution to expel communists from the ANC:\n. . . from the little knowledge I had at the time about communists I\nregarded them as people who were hostile to African nationalism, which\nI regarded as being extremely important from the point of view of\nmobilizing the African people as such. I was also under the view, My\nLord, that the communists opposed organizations like the ANC and that\n\n\fthey would work to subvert both its policies and its campaigns.\nHe went on to explain his change of attitude: \u2018I came to work with them and I\ndiscovered that the views I held about communists in the ANC were not\njustified, both by the outlook and attitude of those persons with whom I worked,\nas well as by their devotion and loyalty to the policy of the ANC.\u2019 Asked if he\never became a communist, he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I did become a communist.\nIf by communist you mean a member of the Communist Party and a person who\nbelieves in the theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin and who adheres strictly\nto the discipline of the party, I did not become a communist.\u2019\nMandela was in the course of explaining the impact of the Defiance Campaign\nwhen Judge Bekker intervened, asking, \u2018Well, as a matter of fact, isn\u2019t your\nfreedom a direct threat to the Europeans?\u2019 Mandela replied:\nNo, it is not a direct threat to the Europeans, as Europeans. We are not antiwhite; we are against white supremacy and in struggling against white\nsupremacy we have the support of some sections of the European population. . .\nAs a matter of fact, My Lord, I think that we in the Congress must take credit for\nthe fact that there is a movement in this country for racial peace. I think in\nnumerous speeches which have been made by leading members of the ANC,\nsome of which have been placed before this court, it is quite clear that the\nCongress has consistently preached a policy of racial harmony and we have\ncondemned racialism no matter by whom it is professed.\nMandela denied that the Freedom Charter meant eliminating private\nenterprise.\nMANDELA: Apart from those industries [mines and banks] the Freedom\nCharter does not call for socialism in this country.\nKENTRIDGE: Have you made any study of socialism?\nMANDELA: I have read some books . . . pro and against.\nKENTRIDGE: And are you interested in socialism?\nMANDELA: I am very much attracted to it.\nKENTRIDGE: Have you read anything about the system in the Soviet\nUnion?\nMANDELA: Very little, My Lords, but I have.\n\n\fKENTRIDGE: Do you find that system interesting?\nMANDELA: I find it very interesting.\nKENTRIDGE: As far as you know what the situation is, is there anything\nabout the Soviet Union that impresses you?\nMANDELA: Yes. I am impressed by the entire absence of the colour bar.\n. . Secondly, I am impressed by the fact that the Soviet Union has no\ncolonies in Africa and as far as I know in any other part of the world. I\nam also impressed by the stand which the Soviet Union has taken on the\nquestion of imperialism . . .\nKENTRIDGE: Do you hope to introduce the system in the Soviet Union\nin South Africa?\nMANDELA: No, My Lords. All that impresses me is the ideal of a\nsocialist society, but I have no intention of copying anything that has\nbeen done in any other country.\nMandela was asked by Kentridge to explain what he meant when, in an article\nin Liberation, he described the Freedom Charter as \u2018a revolutionary document\u2019\nwhich envisaged changes that could not be won \u2018without breaking up the\neconomic and political set-up of present South Africa\u2019. In reply, Mandela said,\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t mean that we would do away with parliamentary institutions; they\nwould remain, but the composition would be so radically different that it would\nbe appropriate to say that the political structure has been broken up.\u2019\nJudge Bekker asked him to expand on this point.\nI accept that the authorities will not of their own free will legislate that\nwe should be given these rights. There will have to be a tremendous\namount of pressure put up by the Congress movement. . . . We will have\nto launch defiance campaigns, stay-at-homes, a combination of these, and\nit will be because of that pressure that we expect the government either to\ngive in to our demands and to say that we have come to the conclusion\nthat we can no longer continue with the present set-up. We will repeal all\nlaws which discriminate against non-Europeans. Either that, or the voters\nwould say that we can\u2019t have this mass defiance of the laws, we can\u2019t\nhave this situation of uncertainty and insecurity. We call upon the\ngovernment to resign, and to make way for a government which is going\nto meet the demands. That is what I have in mind, My Lords, when I say\n\n\fthat these demands cannot be attained without breaking up the political\nand economic set-up in the country. I do visualize the exertion of\npressure on a tremen - dous scale.\nIn their cross-examination of Mandela, the prosecutors tried time and again to\nget him to confess on the matter of violence. Phrases like \u2018revolutionary\neruption\u2019, \u2018seizure of power\u2019 and \u2018people\u2019s democracy\u2019, which he had used in\narticles and speeches and which other activists had also used, were turned over\nagain and again in the search for violent meaning. The nub of the prosecutor\u2019s\nattack was that in order to achieve the aims of the Freedom Charter the ANC\nwould have to resort to the violent overthrow of the government.\nMANDELA: My own view is that it is not necessary in this country to\nemploy force and violence in order to bring about either the demands set\nout in the Freedom Charter, or even to bring about socialism. I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s necessary at all to do so. . . .\nPROSECUTOR: Do you think it\u2019s possible to achieve a transformation\nto a communist state in this country peacefully?\nMANDELA: You keep on talking about a communist state; I talk about a\nsocialist state . . .\nPROSECUTOR: Is there a possibility that the application of pressure by\nthe Congress movement might result in strong counterpressure by the\ngovernment, the ruling class, and that there would be violence?\nMANDELA: That possibility is always there . . . but we believe that our\npolicy will bring down the government in spite of its intentions. . . . In\nthis country there is a large body of voters who are hostile to the policy\nof the government, and we believe that because of pressure, both\nexternally and internally . . . the government will be brought to realize\nthat its policy is futile.\nMandela explained that the kind of state he envisaged could not be achieved\nby \u2018small concessions\u2019 from the government, like having whites representing\nblack interests in parliament: \u2018You will create that state if the vote is extended to\nall sections of the population.\u2019\nPROSECUTOR: Do you think that your people\u2019s democracy could be\nachieved by a process of gradual reforms? Suppose, as a result of\npressure, the ruling class were to agree next month to a qualified\n\n\ffranchise for the Africans, an educational test perhaps\u2014not a stringent\none\u2014and next year, as a result of further pressure, a more important\nconcession is made in, and so on over a period of ten or twenty\nyears\u2014do you think that the people\u2019s democracy could be achieved in\nthat fashion?\nMANDELA: . . . In my own view I would say, \u2018Yes, let us talk,\u2019 and the\ngovernment would say, \u2018We think that the Europeans at present are not\nready for a type of government where there might be domination by nonEuropeans. We think we should give you sixty seats. The African\npopulation to elect sixty Africans to represent them in Parliament. We\nwill leave the matter over for five years and we will review it at the end\nof five years.\u2019 In my view, that would be a victory, My Lords; we would\nhave taken a significant step towards the attainment of universal adult\nsuffrage for Africans, and we would then for the five years say, we will\nsuspend civil disobedience; we won\u2019t have any stay-at-homes, and we\nwill then devote the intervening period for the purposes of educating the\ncountry, the Europeans, to see that these changes can be brought about\nand that it would bring about better racial understanding, better harmony\nin the country. I\u2019d say we should accept it, but, of course, I would not\nabandon the demands for the extension of the franchise to all Africans.\nThat\u2019s how I see it, My Lords.\nThen, at the end of the five-year period, we will have discussions, and\nif the government says, \u2018We will give you again forty more seats,\u2019 I\nmight say that that is quite sufficient. Let\u2019s accept it, and still demand\nthat the franchise should be extended, but for the agreed period we\nshould suspend civil disobedience, no stay-at-homes. In that way we\nwould eventually be able to get everything we want; we shall have our\npeople\u2019s democracy, My Lords . . .\nJUDGE KENNEDY: Mandela, assuming you were wrong in your\nbeliefs, do you visualize any future action on behalf of the government,\nby the government? Because I think the evidence suggests that you could\nnot expect the government to soften in its views. Have you any future\nplans in that event?\nMANDELA: No, My Lords, I don\u2019t think that the Congress has ever\nbelieved that its policy of pressure would ultimately fail. The Congress,\n\n\fof course, does not expect that one single push to coerce the government\nto change its policy will succeed; the Congress expects that over a\nperiod, as a result of a repetition of these pressures, together with world\nopinion, that the government, notwithstanding its attitude of ruling\nAfricans with an iron hand, that notwithstanding that, the methods which\nwe are using will bring about a realization of our aspirations.\nMandela said the ANC believed that it would be possible to achieve its aims\nthrough numerical superiority, without resorting to violence.\nWe had in mind that in the foreseeable future it will be possible for us to\nachieve these demands, and we worked on the basis that Europeans\nthemselves, in spite of the wall of prejudice and hostility which we\nencountered, that they can never remain indifferent indefinitely to our\ndemands, because we are hitting them in the stomach with our policy of\neconomic pressure. It is a method which is well organized. The\nEuropeans dare not look at it with indifference. They would have to\nrespond to it and, indeed, My Lords, they are responding to it.\nMandela\u2019s performance under cross-examination allowed the prosecution to\nmake no headway in trying to expose the ANC on the question of violence. But\nthere remained the prosecution\u2019s key piece of evidence, the tape-recording of\nRobert Resha addressing volunteers in ANC headquarters. \u2018A volunteer is a\nperson who is disciplined,\u2019 he had said. \u2018This is the key of the volunteer\u2014\ndiscipline. When you are disciplined and you are told by the organization not to\nbe violent, you must not be violent. If you are a true volunteer and you are called\nupon to be violent, you must be absolutely violent, you must murder! Murder!\nThat is all!\u2019\nBoth Luthuli and Mandela were asked to comment on Resha\u2019s remarks.\nLuthuli replied that if a general in the army was at fault, it did not imply he\nrepresented a whole policy. \u2018If Resha as a general departs, he departs as Resha.\nIt has nothing to do with the policy of the African National Congress, definitely.\u2019\nMandela\u2019s view was similarly straightforward.\nMANDELA: I understand it to mean that when a volunteer is called upon\nto perform a certain task, he must perform that task, but obviously if that\ntask is contrary to the policy of Congress, we don\u2019t expect any volunteer\nto carry out that task.\nPROSECUTOR: As far as you are concerned, there is nothing in that\n\n\fspeech which you find inconsistent with the policy of the ANC?\nMANDELA: If the speech advocates violence, of course it is totally\ncontrary to the policy of Congress.\nResha himself spent days in the witness box under examination and crossexamination. Asked by Bram Fischer how he could reconcile his speech with\nANC policy, he replied simply, \u2018The example I used in that speech cannot be\nreconciled with the policy of the African National Congress.\u2019\nProfessor Matthews, the concluding witness for the defence, was also asked\nabout Resha\u2019s speech. \u2018Just words,\u2019 said the professor. \u2018You know,\u2019 said the\nprosecutor, Gustav Hoexter, \u2018I think you\u2019re right.\u2019\n\nIn the four years that the treason trial had lasted, Mandela had grown\nconsiderably in stature. His skill in handling the defence of the accused, along\nwith Duma Nokwe, when their lawyers withdrew from the proceedings, added to\nhis standing as a lawyer. He appeared confident and at ease in the witness box,\nholding his own against the attack of the prosecutors, displaying a depth of\nknowledge and understanding which even they found impressive. As the\nspokesman for the prisoners in Pretoria, he had shown equal determination in\nfighting the smaller battles against white authority. He responded instinctively to\nchallenge. When confronted with difficulties, he tackled them undaunted, giving\na lead to others, always mindful of the need to keep up their spirits. He had\nacquired a wider sense of responsibility since his days as a gadfly. Prominent\nwhite activists who had once considered him a \u2018lightweight\u2019 came to regard him\nas \u2018a man ripe for the moment\u2019. His old mentor, Walter Sisulu, the anchor of the\nANC throughout the s, remained as great an influence on him as before.\nMandela\u2019s first reflex in considering many a problem was to ask, \u2018What does\nWalter think?\u2019 According to Rusty Bernstein, \u2018Mandela had good judgement as\nan arbitrator and a conciliator. He was not so good on individual judgements, but\nusually he consulted and listened, and usually he consulted Walter.\u2019\nThat habit would continue for years to come, but by  Mandela had\nemerged as a leader in his own right.\n\nThe state of emergency was lifted on  August , enabling Mandela to go\n\n\fhome for the first time in five months. \u2018After one has been in prison,\u2019 he wrote,\n\u2018it is the small things that one appreciates: being able to take a walk whenever\none wants, going into a shop and buying a newspaper, speaking or choosing to\nremain silent. The simple act of being able to control one\u2019s person.\u2019\nThe problem remained about what to do next. In prison there had been much\ntalk about the use of violence. The banning of the ANC had closed off the\npossibility of conventional opposition. Agitation for action against the\ngovernment was growing among youth groups. The ANC\u2019s leaders, however,\nconsidered the use of violence to be neither a feasible nor a desirable course of\naction, on both practical and political grounds. A major concern was the position\nof Luthuli, who would never have countenanced the idea. But equally important\nwas the ANC\u2019s continuing hope that mass action might still shake the\ngovernment. As Mandela had explained in his testimony at the treason trial, the\nnationalists believed that they could mount sufficient \u2018pressure\u2019 on the\ngovernment and on the economy to cause a change of mind among the white\npopulation. Though there was scant evidence to support it, they clung to the\nnotion that such a change was already under way. What was decided, therefore,\nat a secret meeting of the ANC\u2019s national executive in September was to\nreorganise the ANC on an underground basis, resurrecting the old \u2018M\u2019 Plan. A\nnew working committee in Johannesburg was given responsibility for the task; it\nincluded Mandela, Sisulu, Nokwe, Marks and Kotane.\nWhile the ANC uneasily pondered its next moves, the communists had no\nsuch qualms. Nurtured on theories of revolutionary violence, they read from the\ntrend of events in South Africa a new revolutionary potential and leapt publicly\ninto the fray. On  July , after seven years of secret underground activity,\nthe Communist Party distributed leaflets announcing its existence and calling on\nworkers to rally in the struggle against the government. From his hide-outs in\nJohannesburg, moving between ten different houses in five months, Harmel\nproduced a paper arguing that it was necessary to abandon non-violence as the\nsole means of struggle and move to armed methods. Harmel\u2019s view was, \u2018No\nfurther progress is possible along the traditional paths or by adhering strictly to\nthe non-violence slogan in a situation where every democratic demand or\ncriticism is treated as an act of rebellion or treason.\u2019 Such was the respect in\nwhich Harmel was held that the idea gained immediate credibility. Some\ncommunists, like Ben Turok, regarded him as the \u2018Lenin of the movement\u2019.\nAmong those influenced by Harmel was Bram Fischer. Fischer\u2019s role in the\n\n\fresistance was becoming ever more extraordinary. During the state of\nemergency, his wife, Molly, was imprisoned, leaving him on his own to care for\nhis children, one of whom, Paul, suffered from permanent poor health and\nsometimes hovered close to death. At the treason trial, meanwhile, Fischer\u2019s\nresponsibilities included handling Robert Resha, the most difficult of all the\naccused. At the same time, not only was he providing an important link between\nthe accused and the outside world, even managing to smuggle a radio into\nPretoria Central for them, but he was also one of the principal links between the\nunderground party committee, led by Harmel and Kotane, and the outside world,\nhaving to avoid police surveillance all the while. On top of all this, he was\nconstantly preoccupied with helping the wives and families of detainees. \u2018During\nthe emergency,\u2019 recalled Bernstein, \u2018Bram was undertaking everyone else\u2019s\nproblems.\u2019\nFischer became a reluctant convert to the idea of armed struggle. He had\ndoubts as to whether an underground movement could mount a campaign of\nviolence as well as survive the repression that would inevitably follow. He was\nalso anxious about taking steps from which there could be no retreat. But\nultimately he conceded that every other alternative had been tried, to no avail.\nOther leading communists, notably Kotane, were also sceptical. Kotane was\nworried that the resort to violence would undermine the ability of an\nunderground movement to continue with non-violent political work.\nThe enthusiasts, however, carried the day. They saw themselves in the\ntradition of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries determined to strike against a\nbrutal, decaying regime. The armed struggle, they believed, would receive\nmassive support from the oppressed African population. At the forefront of this\ngroup was Joe Slovo, a hardline Stalinist with romantic notions about\nrevolutionary warfare. At a secret meeting in December  at a private house\nin Victoria, a white suburb of Johannesburg, the communists took the decision to\nestablish an armed force consisting of small squads of saboteurs as a prelude to\nengaging in guerrilla warfare.\nMandela was fully informed of these developments. But though he was as\nkeen as the communists to retaliate against the government, he acknowledged\nthat the ANC, with its broad constituency of interests, was in no position to\nfollow suit. Neither was he himself able to offer any leadership on the matter.\nFor not only was he still preoccupied with the treason trial in Pretoria but he was\nalso subject to a banning order restricting his movements.\n\n\fHis time was also taken up with endeavours to earn a living as a lawyer.\nThough the firm of Mandela and Tambo had closed down, Mandela was\noperating on a freelance basis from Kholvad House in the flat in which Ismail\nMeer had once lived but which had since been taken over by Kathy Kathrada.\nHe was not short of clients. The lounge and the passage outside the flat were\noften crammed with clients.\nAll this left Mandela with little enough time to enjoy any kind of family life.\nWinnie, heavily pregnant, rarely saw him. Even on the birth of their second\ndaughter, Zindziswa, in December , Mandela was diverted from attending\nby another small crisis. Learning that his son, Makgatho, was ill in the Transkei,\nwhere he attended school, Mandela drove through the night to reach him,\nviolating his banning order, bringing him back to Johannesburg for surgery, only\nto find he had missed the birth.\nThe treason trial, meanwhile, lumbered on into its concluding stages. The\nprosecution\u2019s closing argument, begun on  November , finally ended, after\nseveral adjournments, on  March . The defence\u2019s closing argument\nfollowed, with Maisels beginning by refuting all charges of violence. \u2018We admit\nthat there is a question of non-cooperation and passive resistance,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\nshall say quite frankly that if non-cooperation and passive resistance constitute\nhigh treason, then we are guilty. But these are plainly not encompassed in the\nlaw of treason.\u2019\nThe defence lawyers had expected their closing argument to take up to three\nmonths, so complex were many of the issues involved. But after only two weeks,\nwhile Bram Fischer was engaged in a lengthy analysis of ANC policies, the\njudges made a series of interruptions directing him to focus on specific issues.\nFinally, on  March, in a further dramatic intervention, they adjourned the court\nuntil  March to consider whether they could forgo hearing certain aspects of\nthe defence argument, in the interests of shortening the trial. The clear\nimplication was that they had already made up their minds in favour of acquittal.\nThis sudden and unexpected turn of events had an immediate impact on\nMandela\u2019s decisions about his future. His banning order, in place for five years,\nwas due to expire two days hence, on  March. He had planned to use the\nopportunity to travel to Pietermaritzburg at the weekend to address a conference\nof Congress supporters, called the \u2018All-in Conference\u2019, before returning to\nPretoria to resume his place at the treason trial. The purpose of this conference\n\n\fwas to issue demands for a national convention for all South Africans to draw up\na non-racial constitution.\nAt a hastily convened meeting of the ANC\u2019s working committee in\nJohannesburg, it was agreed that if on  March the accused were acquitted,\nMandela should immediately go underground to organise support for the\nnational convention, avoiding any further restrictions on him the government\nmight seek to impose and surfacing in public on carefully planned occasions to\nachieve a maximum of publicity: \u2018It was not a proposal that came as a surprise to\nme, nor was it one I particularly relished, but it was something I knew I had to\ndo.\u2019\nAccompanied by Sisulu, Nokwe and one of his new lieutenants, Joe Modise, a\ntough street-fighter from Alexandra, Mandela went to his house in Orlando to\ntell Winnie what would now happen. They had never previously discussed the\npossibility that he might leave home; nor was she even aware that his banning\norder was due to expire, or that he planned to travel to Pietermaritzburg that\nweekend. Mandela never confided in Winnie. She was simply told what to do.\nShe recalled:\nThey all stood outside in the driveway of the garage and he sent a child to call\nme. On my arrival he simply said, \u2018Darling, just pack some of my clothes in a\nsuitcase with my toiletries. I will be going away for a long time. You\u2019re not to\nworry, my friends here will look after you. They\u2019ll give you news of me from\ntime to time. Look well after the children. I know you\u2019ll have the strength and\ncourage to do so without me. I know you are capable of that.\u2019\nI quickly packed his clothes. I was in tears but I had been conditioned in the\nfew months we had together not to ask any questions. I only wished him well\nbefore we parted and asked that the gods of Africa take care of him wherever he\nwould be, and that he would have a chance to spare the children and me a few\nminutes sometime. He scolded me for reminding him of his duties.\nMandela did not enter the house. By the time Winnie had finished packing his\nbag, he had gone. An hour later, Joe Modise returned to collect it.\nMandela\u2019s sudden appearance at the All-in Conference in an Indian hall in\nPietermaritzburg on  March had an electrifying effect on the delegates. He had\nnot been seen on a public platform since . He was duly elected to head a\nNational Action Council charged with the task of organising the campaign for a\nnational convention. The first phase of the campaign was to take the form of a\n\n\fthree-day national stay-away, to be carried out if the government failed to\nrespond by  May to the demand for a national convention, as everyone\nexpected it to do. Some , delegates joined enthusiastically in the\nproceedings, not knowing that this was to be the last large conference organised\nby African leaders in South Africa for many years. It was also Mandela\u2019s last\npublic appearance. Having made a successful impact, he drove back to Pretoria\nto hear the verdict of the treason trial.\n\nIt took Judge Rumpff forty minutes in the Old Synagogue in Pretoria on \nMarch  to deliver the court\u2019s findings. He reviewed a number of\nconclusions which the three judges had reached unanimously. The court found,\nhe said, that the ANC and its allies had been working \u2018to replace the present\nform of state with a radically and fundamentally different form of state\u2019; that the\nProgramme of Action \u2018envisaged the use of illegal means\u2019 and that illegal means\nwere used during the Defiance Campaign; that some ANC leaders \u2018made\nthemselves guilty of sporadic speeches of violence which in our opinion\namounted to an incitement to violence\u2019; that \u2018a strong left-wing tendency\nmanifested itself\u2019in the ANC during the indictment period between  and\n; and that the ANC frequently revealed \u2018anti-imperialist, anti-West and proSoviet\u2019 attitudes.\nBut although there had been some violent speeches by ANC members\u2014\u2018a\nminute percentage of the total number of speeches made\u2019\u2014there was no proof of\nan ANC policy of violent revolution. There was also no proof that the ANC was\na communist organisation or that it had been infiltrated by communists, or that\nthe Freedom Charter envisaged a communist state.\n\u2018The cornerstone of the case\u2019, said Rumpff, was the ANC\u2019s alleged policy of\nincitement to violence. The prosecution\u2019s failure to prove this policy \u2018inevitably\nmeant a collapse of the whole case\u2019:\nOn all the evidence presented to this court and on our findings of fact, it is\nimpossible for this court to come to the conclusion that the African National\nCongress had acquired or adopted a policy to overthrow the state by violence,\nthat is, in the sense that the masses had to be prepared or conditioned to commit\ndirect acts of violence against the state.\nIn the crowded courtroom, there was not a movement, not a murmur, as\n\n\fRumpff delivered his final words: \u2018The accused are accordingly found not guilty\nand are discharged.\u2019\nOnce the judges in their scarlet robes had filed out, the spectators\u2019 gallery\nerupted in cheers and the accused hugged one another and waved to the\nonlookers. In the courtyard outside, Mandela embraced Winnie. As the accused\ncelebrated their release amid a throng of friends and family, laughing, weeping\nand singing, Maisels and Fischer were hoisted high above their shoulders.\nEach of the three judges at the treason trial handed down separate reasons for\nthe conclusions they reached in their joint judgement. In his reasons for\njudgement, which ran to  pages, Rumpff referred to the evidence given both\nby Luthuli and by Mandela to support his findings that communism had not been\nadopted by the ANC. In the case of Luthuli, it was because of his openly anticommunist Christian stance; in the case of Mandela, it was because in  he\n\u2018foresaw a non-European bourgeois advance under the Freedom Charter\u2019.\nRumpff was not convinced, he said, \u2018that the African National Congress had\nacquired a policy which caused it to cross the dividing line between noncommunism and communism in the spectrum of socialist belief\u2019.\nBekker, giving his reasons for judgement, took issue with the prosecution\u2019s\ncontention that the accused planned to set up a communist system of government\nin South Africa: \u2018I share the view expressed by Mandela that in order to achieve\nthis state (as envisaged in the Freedom Charter) the present economic and\npolitical set-up in South Africa will have to be broken.\u2019 But, he went on, he\ndisagreed with the proposition that the only form of state envisaged by the\nFreedom Charter was a communist one:\nThis definition does not in my opinion necessarily imply a one-party system as\nbeing put forward since in the classes which remain after the exclusion of the\n\u2018few exploiters\u2019 as defined, there may very well be room, for instance, for a\ncommunist party on the one hand and a socialist party on the other. . . . I am\naccordingly unable to agree that the one and only inference to be drawn from the\ndocument is that a dictatorship of the proletariat was being advocated.\nThe court record of the treason trial ran to nearly  million words bound in\n volumes of  pages each. Yet no single act of conspiracy or any act of\nviolence was ever alleged by the prosecution, and many of the claims it made\nabout the \u2018explosive\u2019 nature of the racial situation in South Africa in  and\nabout speeches \u2018bristling with references to the spilling of blood\u2019 it never\n\n\fmanaged to substantiate. As an attempt to demonstrate that opposition to the\ngovernment was due principally to the work of communists, the trial was clearly\na failure.\nThe government drew its own conclusions from this outcome. One of the\nspectators who went to watch the trial when it was still in its early stages was\nJohn Vorster, an advocate and former Nazi sympathiser who had been\nimprisoned without trial during the Second World War for pro-German\nactivities. Appointed by Verwoerd as his new minister of justice a few months\nafter the treason trial verdict, with instructions to root out all resistance, Vorster\nresolved that if the government\u2019s opponents could not be crushed by the law,\nthen the law would have to be changed and evidence obtained by other means.\nRecalling the meeting on the day in August  that Verwoerd appointed him,\nhe said, \u2018I remember saying to Dr Verwoerd that he should let me deal with the\nthreat of subversion and revolution in my own way. I told him that you could not\nfight communism with the Queensbury rules, because if you did then you would\nlose. He agreed with me and said that he would leave me free to do what I had to\ndo\u2014within reason.\u2019\nVorster appointed a new head of the security police, Hendrik van den Bergh,\nwho had been interned with him during the war and who shared his views about\nhow to tackle the problem. As van den Bergh recalled, \u2018For me the choice was\nbetween revolution, violence and a bloodbath and the so-called rule of law,\nabout which there was all the noise. I looked at my children and those of others\nand said, \u201cTo the devil with the rule of law.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn the night that the accused were discharged, Bram Fischer gave a party at\nBeaumont Street to celebrate. As the guests arrived, they were watched by\nSpecial Branch detectives waiting in two cars in the street outside. Mandela did\nnot join them. Nor did he go home. He spent the night in a safe house in\nJohannesburg, growing accustomed to a life in the underground.\n SPEAR OF THE NATION\nA WARRANT FOR MANDELA\u2019S ARREST WAS SOON ISSUED. HE WAS\nTHE only member of the National Action Committee, given responsibility for\norganising the national strike, who had been publicly identified. The names of\nother members, like Sisulu, were deliberately not disclosed, since organising a\nstrike by Africans was a criminal offence. Mandela was therefore certain to face\na prison sentence, unless he could successfully evade capture. There was a large\ncontingent of ANC supporters ready to help. But what was even more important\nwas that Mandela had access to the network of Communist Party supporters who\nhad had eight years of experience of working underground undetected and were\nalready proficient in the use of secret communications, safe houses and hidden\nmeetings.\nThis new style of leadership\u2014operating from an underground headquarters\u2014\ncaused considerable controversy within the ANC. The ANC was accustomed to\nits leaders standing openly in defiance of the government to demonstrate their\nwillingness to make the same sacrifices they were urging on their supporters.\nDuring the Defiance Campaign, prominent officials had lined up to be arrested\nand had openly sought imprisonment. Imprisonment was seen to be as much a\nsymbol of defiance as the breaking of laws. Mandela\u2019s decision, therefore, not to\nseek arrest or to stand trial in connection with charges arising from his\nleadership of the strike represented a significant change in how the ANC\nbelieved it should conduct the business of liberation; some critics charged it was\ntantamount to \u2018running away\u2019.\nMandela\u2019s skill in evading capture, however, soon caught the imagination of\nthe press and the public. The press dubbed him the Black Pimpernel, an African\nversion of the Scarlet Pimpernel, a fictional character who evaded capture during\nthe French Revolution. Mandela moved about the country, from Port Elizabeth\nto Cape Town, to Durban, to Johannesburg, urging support for the strike,\nmeeting journalists and advertising his activities through telephone calls to\nnewspapers. Much of the work he carried out at night, growing used to spending\n\n\fhis days in hide-outs. He disguised himself with different outfits, dressing in\nworkmen\u2019s overalls or chauffeurs\u2019 clothes, growing a beard, wearing round,\nrimless spectacles, walking and speaking in a manner as unobtrusive as possible.\nAfter dark he often appeared as a night watchman, dressed in a large grey\novercoat and cap pulled over his eyes and occasionally sporting large earrings.\nPolice efforts to find him\u2014mounting roadblocks, searching houses\u2014proved\nfruitless. Mandela was constantly on the move, going from one safe house to\nanother. There were times, however, when he had a narrow escape. An African\npoliceman in Johannesburg recognised him in his chauffeur\u2019s uniform, but\npassed by with a smile. Once while he was waiting in his car at a traffic light,\nColonel Spengler, the head of the security police on the Witwatersrand, who had\nknown him for ten years, drew up alongside but did not glance his way.\nMandela adapted to the solitary nature of underground life without difficulty:\n\u2018I welcomed the opportunity to be by myself, to plan, to think, to plot.\u2019 But he\nwas never able to overcome his longing to see more of Winnie. With Winnie, the\ndiscipline by which he was determined to live fell away. \u2018His meetings with\nWinnie were foolhardy,\u2019 said Rusty Bernstein. \u2018They were high-risk. This was\nhis Achilles\u2019 heel. Otherwise he was extremely cautious.\u2019 On one occasion when\na scheduled meeting with Winnie fell through, Mandela was so disappointed that\nhe simply drove off to look for her. He eventually managed to see her after\ngetting a friend to telephone her. Winnie recalled:\nI saw him frequently when he was underground. I waited for that sacred knock at\nthe window in the early hours of the morning. I never knew when. I never had an\nappointment made. At the beginning he used to come home for an hour or so\nearly in the morning, depending on the political situation. Later, they were\nwatching me twenty-four hours a day and I had to slip out through police\ncordons to go to him.\nThen, someone would come and order me to follow him in my car. We would\ndrive a kilometre or so from the house, we would then meet another car, we\nwould jump from that one into another, and by the time I reached him I had gone\nthrough something like ten cars. I never knew where I was. His hide-outs were\nall over the country. The people who arranged this were, of course, mostly\nwhites.\nShe never knew the identity of these white couriers. \u2018I would just find myself\nat the end of the journey in some white house; in most cases when we got there\n\n\fthey were deserted. You could see that arrangements had been made for families\nto stay away while we were there together.\u2019\nThe dates chosen for the three-day stay-at-home were - May, to coincide\nwith the day nominated by the government to proclaim South Africa a republic,\n May. The establishment of a republic, free from all links with the British\ncrown, had been one of the most cherished objectives of Afrikaner nationalists\nsince Britain\u2019s defeat of the old Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange\nFree State in . A referendum among the white electorate in October \nhad produced a small overall majority in favour of a republic. Verwoerd\nintended that Republic Day on  May would be remembered as a day of\ncelebration.\nThe ANC\u2019s plans for strike action thus became a trial of strength. In April,\nMandela wrote a letter to Verwoerd, on behalf of the National Action\nCommittee, requesting him to call a national convention or face a massive strike.\n\u2018We have no illusions about the counter-measures your government might take,\u2019\nhe wrote. \u2018During the last twelve months we have gone through a period of grim\ndictatorship.\u2019 Nevertheless, he added, \u2018We are not deterred by threats of force\nand violence.\u2019 Verwoerd did not reply.\nMandela appealed for help from the leader of the opposition United Party, Sir\nde Villiers Graaf. \u2018Stated bluntly, the alternatives appear to be these: talk it out,\nor shoot it out,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018It is still not too late to turn the tide against the\nNationalist-created crisis. A call for a national convention from you now could\nwell be the turning point.\u2019 He did not receive a reply.\nIn an article in the liberal journal Contact, Mandela appealed for support from\nstudent leaders and sportsmen. He was optimistic about what could be achieved:\n\u2018There are some who are still assailed by doubts and hesitations. We say to them\nthat the times are critical and momentous. We urge them to join in with us and\ntogether to deliver the knockout punch.\u2019\nThe counter-measures ordered by Verwoerd far exceeded anything that\nMandela had expected. In the largest mobilisation since the war, the government\ncalled out army and police reserves. All police leave was cancelled. Armed\nguards were posted to protect power stations and other essential services. Police\nraids were conducted night after night in African townships; helicopters were\nused to train searchlights on houses, yards and unlit areas; police vans broadcast\nwarnings that Africans who went on strike would be sacked and forced out of\n\n\ftowns. Employers threatened mass dismissals. All political meetings were\nbanned. A twelve-day detention law was introduced. Troops camped in the heart\nof Johannesburg, ready for action. It was the biggest show of strength the\nNationalist government had ever mounted.\nIn parliament, Verwoerd issued warnings not only to \u2018agitators\u2019 but also to\n\u2018members of the ordinary public\u2019, including \u2018some intellectuals and some\npseudo-intellectuals as well as some newspapers\u2019 who were \u2018busy playing with\nfire\u2019 by advocating a multiracial national convention. This proposal, he said, was\nmade by communists and \u2018everyone who lends support to this proposition, will,\nwhatever his personal aims may be, become jointly responsible for what is their\n[the communists\u2019] aim\u2019.\nDespite this display of might by the government, the strike call on  May\nwas answered by thousands of workers in major towns. Scores of industries and\nfactories were disrupted. But the overall result did not match Mandela\u2019s\nexpectations. He described the first day of the stay-at-home as \u2018not the national\nsuccess I had hoped for\u2019; and on the second day, he called off the campaign.\nIn the following days, at carefully arranged venues, Mandela gave a series of\ninterviews to foreign journalists. At one meeting, in a sparsely furnished flat in\nYeoville, north-east of the city centre, he appeared relaxed, dressed in a striped\nsports shirt and grey trousers, with a side-parting clipped neatly in his hair,\nlaughing easily as he welcomed the visitors. Did he concede, asked one\ncorrespondent, that the strike had been a failure? \u2018In the light of the steps taken\nby government to suppress the stay-at-home, it was a tremendous success,\u2019 he\nreplied. The mobilisation of the army as well as the police was \u2018striking\ntestimony of African strength and a measure of the government\u2019s weakness\u2019. But\nin a television interview, at the house of a white supporter, he struck a far more\nsombre note: \u2018If the government reaction is to crush by naked force our\nnonviolent demonstrations, we will have to seriously reconsider our tactics. In\nmy mind we are closing a chapter on this question of nonviolent policy.\u2019\n\nThe failure of the May strike convinced Mandela that there was nothing further\nto be gained from continuing with protest action and that the only alternative\navailable was to resort to violence. \u2018Non - violent, passive resistance is effective\nas long as your opposition adheres to the same rules as you do,\u2019 he said. \u2018But if\npeaceful protest is met with violence, its efficacy is at an end.\u2019 The case for\n\n\fhitting back at the government, he believed, was now overwhelming. Africans\nhad to show that their white rulers were still vulnerable and could be hurt.\nMandela conferred first with Sisulu, who agreed that a change in strategy was\ninevitable. \u2018Looking at the situation, I can\u2019t see what else could have been done,\u2019\nsaid Sisulu. \u2018There was this dilemma. The government was acting violently. We\nwere leading the movement. People were entitled to know how we were meeting\nthis violence. The time had come for us to make preparations. But this was not\nthe type of issue that we could have taken to the masses. We had to get the\nleadership committed. We needed a small number of people to start it. With\ndelay, the idea might have fizzled out.\u2019\nMandela and Sisulu both believed that a limited campaign of sabotage would\nscare off foreign investors, disrupt trade and cause sufficient damage to the\neconomy to force the white electorate and the government to alter course. The\ngovernment, they assumed, was not strong enough to embark on further\nrepression. \u2018I didn\u2019t think the government could suppress the whole movement,\u2019\nsaid Sisulu.\nMandela raised the issue of armed struggle with the ANC\u2019s working\ncommittee, but ran into a wall of opposition from Moses Kotane. Kotane, in his\ncharacteristically blunt manner, accused Mandela of failing to think through his\nproposal carefully. Mandela, he said, had been outmanoeuvred and paralysed by\nthe government\u2019s actions and now, in desperation, was resorting to revolutionary\nlanguage. \u2018There is still room,\u2019 he said, \u2018for the old methods if we are\nimaginative and determined enough. If we embark on the course Mandela is\nsuggesting, we will be exposing innocent people to massacres by the enemy.\u2019\nKotane\u2019s argument carried the day.\nShortly afterwards, at a meeting Sisulu had arranged, Mandela and Kotane\nspent a whole day arguing further over the issue. There was a certain irony about\nthe confrontation. Kotane, a lifelong communist from peasant origins, a graduate\nof the Lenin School in Moscow, secretary-general of the underground\nCommunist Party, with revolutionary credentials far superior to Mandela\u2019s,\nargued adamantly that the potential for conventional political struggle had by no\nmeans been exhausted; it was only because political work had become more\ndifficult that Mandela was seeking the easy way out and trying to escape the\nresponsibilities of political leadership. The time for armed struggle had not yet\narrived. An austere, puritanical figure, Kotane was known both for his arrogant\n\n\fand assertive manner and also for his hard-headed realism.\nMandela, a Xhosa aristocrat, a trained lawyer who had just emerged from a\nmarathon trial, the outcome of which had depended on convincing a panel of\njudges about the ANC\u2019s commitment to nonviolent methods, responded to\nKotane by using arguments fashioned by Kotane\u2019s own colleagues in the\nCommunist Party in favour of violence. Castro\u2019s recent revolution in Cuba,\nMandela said, had shown how it was not necessary for revolutionaries to wait for\nappropriate conditions, as defined in the textbooks of Lenin and Stalin, to\nmaterialise. \u2018If you wait for textbook conditions, they will never occur.\u2019\nMilitants were already forming their own armed units. The leadership was now\nfalling behind its supporters.\nThe influence of revolutionary enthusiasts in the Communist Party at this\njuncture was crucial. The communists had already formed their own specialist\nunits for sabotage activity, some fifteen groups of three to four men each, which\nhad begun trying their hand at cutting telephone and communications links. They\nalso had ready access to the Soviet Union and China, both quartermasters to\nrevolution around the world. Plans had already been made to send recruits\noutside the country for training.\nWhat further convinced them of the feasibility of guerrilla warfare in South\nAfrica were the heady examples set by Algeria and by Cuba. By mid-,\nAlgerian nationalists were on the verge of victory over French forces seeking to\ndefend the white settler population. In Cuba, the example was even more potent.\nA group of no more than twelve revolutionaries, including Fidel Castro and Che\nGuevara, survived a landing on the island\u2019s coast in a rickety old boat and within\ntwo years had marched into Havana at the head of a ,-strong victorious\nguerrilla army. Guevara\u2019s \u2018detonator\u2019 theory of revolution, the idea that armed\naction on its own would create a momentum among the population, had a\ndramatic impact on the thinking of South African revolutionaries. \u2018The seminal\nwork was Che Guevara\u2019s Guerrilla Warfare. And many of the errors can be\nattributed to that fact,\u2019 said Ben Turok. \u2018I remember the discussions at the time.\nThe point made was, is it wrong to wait for the objective conditions to develop\nwhere violence becomes naturally part of the struggle, or is the situation such\nthat the subjective element can create the objective, and that\u2019s Che\u2019s argument.\nAnd we became convinced that the subjective could actually play an important\nrole.\u2019\n\n\fThe communists\u2019 objectives did not stop short at sabotage. Joe Slovo, the key\noperational figure in devising the party\u2019s military strategy, believed that\nsabotage would provide a bridge to popular armed struggle, drawing in new\nrecruits and conditioning the population to accept methods of violence,\neventually leading to a broad revolutionary assault on the government. Attaining\nthis objective was feasible given the mass support enjoyed by the ANC. What\nthe Communist Party therefore envisaged was \u2018a united front of national\nliberation\u2019 which would set out \u2018to destroy white domination\u2019. When that goal\nwas reached, the communists would then work to transform South Africa into a\nsocialist state. These two stages of the revolution became official Communist\nParty policy.\nThe flaws in this revolutionary strategy tended to be overlooked. South Africa\npossessed few heavily wooded areas suitable for guerrilla bases. It was\nsurrounded by white-run African colonies which provided no opportunity for\nrear bases. In rural areas, the ANC had never been successful in mobilising\nsupport for its political campaigns; it remained essentially an urban-based\norganisation. In urban areas, the black population was subject to a vast array of\ncontrols which had already effectively crippled political action. Above all, the\ngovernment had never shown any signs of losing control. Its security apparatus\nwas formidable, as the crushing of the May strike had just demonstrated.\nThe communists\u2019 enthusiasm for armed struggle had a marked influence on\nMandela\u2019s own outlook, making it seem more feasible than would otherwise\nhave been the case. \u2018The communists manoeuvred hard for violence,\u2019 remarked\nYusuf Cachalia, Mandela\u2019s Indian activist friend and himself a member of the\nCommunist Party. \u2018They certainly influenced Mandela\u2019s attitude towards\nviolence.\u2019\nAt a second meeting of the ANC\u2019s working committee in June, it was agreed\nthat the issue of armed struggle should be put to the ANC\u2019s national executive\ncommittee and that the Congress alliance, comprising the Indian Congress, the\nCongress of Democrats, the Coloured People\u2019s Congress, the South African\nCongress of Trade Unions and the ANC, should also be consulted. The venue\nchosen for both meetings, to be held on consecutive days, was Tongaat, a small\nvillage surrounded by sugar plantations north of Durban and close to Luthuli\u2019s\nhome in the Umvoti Mission Reserve, enabling him to attend. About sixty\ndelegates in all, most of them subject to banning orders, travelled in secret to\nTongaat.\n\n\fThe ANC meeting lasted all night. Mandela presented his case vigorously.\nViolence, he said, had become inevitable, whether or not it was initiated by the\nANC. ANC supporters were beginning to lose confidence in the policy of\nnonviolence and would eventually resort to violent methods of protest on their\nown. If nationalist leaders failed to take decisive action, the undercurrents of\nhatred rising among the African population would surface in outbreaks of\nterrorism that would have a disastrous impact on race relations. It was both\nwrong and unrealistic for African leaders to continue preaching peace and\nnonviolence when the government\u2019s only response was to meet their demands\nwith force. It would be far better for the ANC to channel and control the\nmomentum towards violence to ensure that it was directed at proper targets. If\nthe ANC failed to take the lead now, it would be left behind.\nLuthuli\u2019s commitment to nonviolence was well known. He believed that\nnonviolence was the only justifiable course of action on both moral and practical\ngrounds. \u2018Violence disrupts human life and is destructive to perpetrator and\nvictim alike,\u2019 he said in . \u2018I do not regard peace as a passive thing. The\nnonviolent policy I am advocating is a positive one. . . . It demands moral\ncourage and taxes our physical courage.\u2019\nLuthuli held firmly to his views, but, after hours of argument, he agreed to a\ncompromise. The ANC would remain committed to nonviolence, but it would\nnot stand in the way of members who wanted to establish a separate and\nindependent military organisation, nor would it disapprove of \u2018properly\ncontrolled violence\u2019.\nThe following night, at the Congress alliance meeting, the arguments raged\nanew. The position was more complex for the ANC\u2019s allies, for while the ANC\nwas an illegal organisation, the others were still able to conduct political work\nlegally. Within the Indian Congress, the commitment to nonviolence was held as\ndeterminedly by many members as it was by Luthuli. The Indian Congress\nleader, Dr Monty Naicker, was adamantly opposed to armed struggle. Jaydew\nSingh, Mandela\u2019s old friend from Kholvad House, declared, \u2018Nonviolence has\nnot failed us; we have failed nonviolence.\u2019 Yusuf Ca - chalia argued\nemphatically that any attempt at armed struggle would end in the government\nwiping out the entire nationalist movement. \u2018It was pure adventurism,\u2019 he said\nyears later. \u2018It was impractical. They had not worked out the consequences.\u2019 Yet\nmost Indian communists were in favour of armed struggle. The Congress of\nDemocrats, influenced mainly by white communists, also supported the move.\n\n\fBy the end of a tumultuous night, Mandela had received the authorisation he\nwanted to establish a military wing.\nThe new organisation rapidly took shape. It was given the name of Umkhonto\nwe Sizwe, meaning the Spear of the Nation, but it became more commonly\nknown by the initials MK. A high command was formed, consisting of Mandela\nas chairman and Slovo as chief-of-staff; Sisulu acted as a political adviser.\nEssentially, MK was launched as a joint venture between the ANC and the\nCommunist Party, with access to all the Communist Party\u2019s resources and its\ninternational connections.\nMandela and Slovo had known each other for more than ten years, but they\nhad never been particularly close. As students at the University of the\nWitwatersrand, they had argued over the role of the communists in the liberation\nstruggle. They had differed on many occasions since. Slovo was widely known\nas an urbane and affable character, a witty raconteur with a liking for wine, song\nand red socks, but he was also a narrow ideologue never deviating from the party\nline. \u2018Slovo and Mandela were often at cross-purposes,\u2019 noted Mac Maharaj, a\nCommunist Party activist. \u2018Their relationship was often abrasive. Joe was unable\nto appreciate what Mandela was saying. He was devious in his arguments, taking\ncontradictory positions. The debate frequently went off the rails.\u2019 But over the\nquestion of armed struggle they found common ground. \u2018Slovo was an\nenthusiast, determined to make an im - mediate impact,\u2019 Maharaj recalled.\n\u2018Mandela had a liking for the bold stroke.\u2019\nThe difficulties they faced were immense. None of the conspirators had any\nexperience of sabotage or guerrilla action. Mandela embarked on the armed\nstruggle knowing literally nothing in practice about what was involved. Slovo\u2019s\nexperience had been limited to his role in a signals unit in the closing stages of\nthe Second World War in Italy; he had never taken part in combat. The\nconspirator with the most military experience was Jack Hodgson, a \u2018desert rat\u2019\nwho had served in a tank corps in North Africa and also had knowledge of\nexplosives gained while working in the mines. An ardent communist and\nfounding member of the Congress of Democrats, Hodgson became MK\u2019s first\ninstructor, teaching recruits the basis of bomb-making. He turned his own flat,\non the fourth floor of a block in Hillbrow, into a bomb laboratory and later into a\nbomb factory. He was a resourceful man, but nevertheless an amateur.\nTo make up for his own lack of knowledge, Mandela read everything he could\n\n\flay his hands on about guerrilla warfare and war history: authors like Guevara,\nMao Tse-tung, Castro and Clausewitz; books on Algeria, Cuba, Israel, Kenya\nand the Anglo-Boer War. \u2018He was particularly impressed by a study of the\ncommunist insurrectionary movement in the Philippines,\u2019 Bernstein recalled. At\nhide-outs during the day, before leaving for night-time assignments, he spent\nhours studying texts and making copious notes. His notes on Mao Tse-tung\u2019s\nStrategic Problems of China\u2019s Revolutionary War ran to sixty-five pages.\n\u2018Mandela wanted a theoretical knowledge of guerrilla warfare,\u2019 noted Maharaj.\n\u2018Slovo was less interested.\u2019\nMandela was provided with a support committee, a small group of activists\nwho arranged everything for him from safe houses to transport and reading\nmaterial. Among the group was Kathy Kathrada, who had been sceptical about\nthe feasibility of armed struggle but who had nevertheless volunteered his\nservices. Another member was Wolfie Kodesh, a long-time communist \u2018foot\nsoldier\u2019 who had seen army service during the Second World War and was\ncurrently a reporter for the radical journal New Age. The support team also\nincluded a talented young lawyer, Bob Hepple, whom Bram Fischer had\nrecruited to the Communist Party. The son of a former leader of the Labour\nParty, he was heavily involved in trade union activity, trying to keep alive the\nSouth African Congress of Trade Unions. Like Fischer and Slovo, he worked\nfrom offices in Innes Chambers in central Johannesburg, a building used by\nmany advocates, which provided a convenient cover for meetings of the\nconspirators.\nMandela\u2019s life underground, as leader of MK, became more settled than it had\nbeen when he was trying to organise support for strike action in May. After\nstaying with a family in Market Street for a few weeks, he moved into a small\nbachelor flat in Berea with Wolfie Kodesh. Mandela insisted on using a camp\nbed, letting Kodesh keep the bed, but Kodesh was considerably \u2018peeved\u2019 to find\nthat it was Mandela\u2019s habit to get up at five each morning to run on the spot. \u2018It\nwent on for well over an hour, followed by exercises,\u2019 Kodesh recalled. Mandela\ntold Kodesh that he would have to join in, which he did, though without much\nenthusiasm. In daytime, Mandela remained inside the flat with the blinds drawn,\nventuring out at night, usually in his disguise as a chauffeur. After two months in\nBerea, he moved briefly to a doctor\u2019s residence in Johannesburg, then spent two\nweeks on a sugar plantation in Tongaat, before returning to Johannesburg to a\nnew address. It was here that MK was eventually to meet its demise.\n\n\fLilliesleaf Farm lay in a secluded, wooded hollow in the Rivonia area, about ten\nmiles north of Johannesburg. It was a smallholding of roughly twenty-eight\nacres, reached only by a dirt road or across the open veld. The farmhouse was\nspacious, with whitewashed walls, large curved windows at the front and a high\nshingle roof, a desirable residence for a wealthy family. Behind the main\nbuilding stood an assortment of outbuildings, storerooms, fuel sheds, work\nrooms and servants\u2019 quarters. There was also a large, imposing thatch-roofed\ncottage.\nLilliesleaf had been bought by the Communist Party in July  initially for\nuse as a safe house. Michael Harmel, adopting a false name, had handled the\ntransaction with an estate agent and Harold Wolpe, the communist lawyer, had\nhelped set up a dummy company to buy the property. The plan was for\nLilliesleaf to be used, by all outward appearances, as a normal white\nsmallholding. The main house would be occupied by a party member, Arthur\nGoldreich, and his family and the farm worked by African labourers. Goldreich\nwas a little-known activist. By profession an artist and designer, employed by a\nlarge department store in Johannesburg, he was a flamboyant personality,\ncharming and talented, who struck many acquaintances as being no more than a\ndilettante. But in his youth he had joined Palmach, a branch of the underground\nJewish army in Palestine, and at heart he was a revolutionary enthusiast.\nThe buildings at Lilliesleaf were in need of renovation and ex - tension, so\nbefore the Goldreichs moved there, a team of African painters and builders was\nhired to do the job. It was at this stage that Mandela took up residence in the\nthatched cottage at Lilliesleaf, ostensibly as an employee of the white owner\nwaiting for his arrival. The alias he used was David Motsamayi, the name of one\nof his former clients. Mandela knew Goldreich quite well; his house in Parktown\nwas one of the secret locations where he met Winnie.\nMandela\u2019s routine at Lilliesleaf was much the same as before. He stayed at\nhome during the day and left for meetings at night. \u2018Mandela had time to read, to\nthink and study at Rivonia,\u2019 said Bernstein. \u2018It was a quiet and peaceful\nexistence. A committee attended to his needs.\u2019 He was joined for a while by\nMichael Harmel, whom he knew as an engaging character but who proved to be\na hopeless conspirator. Disorganised and forgetful, he was invariably sloppy\nabout underground work, infuriating colleagues like Bram Fischer with his\n\n\flapses of security. Mandela returned to Lilliesleaf late one night to find the house\nlights on, the front door open, the radio at full blast and Harmel fast asleep in\nbed. When Mandela woke him up, he complained, \u2018Nel, must you disturb my\nsleep? Can\u2019t this wait until tomorrow?\u2019\nOnce the renovations were complete and the Goldreichs had moved into the\nmain house, it was possible for Winnie and the children to spend weekends with\nMandela. \u2018Ironically,\u2019 said Mandela, \u2018we had more privacy at Lilliesleaf than we\never had at home. The children could run about and play, and we were secure,\nhowever briefly, in this idyllic bubble.\u2019 The older children, Thembi, Makgatho,\nMakaziwe and Zeni, retained indelible impressions of those times spent with\ntheir father, going for walks, playing in the big, rambling house, being carried\nthrough the orchard. Zeni imagined Lilliesleaf to be her real house, because it\nwas the only place she could remember where her father played with her. For\nyears afterwards, she would ask Winnie, \u2018Mummy, when are we going home to\nsee Daddy?\u2019\nMeanwhile, the business of organising armed struggle continued apace. The\nstrategy decided upon by the high command was twofold. First, a sabotage\ncampaign would be carried out against targets like government buildings and\ninstallations, railways, power plants and telecommunications; second,\npreparations would be made for guerrilla warfare if the sabotage campaign failed\nto get the government to change its policies. The strict instruction given to all\nMK members from the start was that on no account were they to kill or injure\npeople in planning or carrying out operations. As Mandela later explained,\n\u2018Sabotage did not involve loss of life, and it offered the best hope for race\nrelations. Bitterness would be kept to a minimum and, if the policy bore fruit,\ndemocratic government could become a reality.\u2019\nThe high command, based in Johannesburg, was made responsible for\ndetermining tactics and general targets and given charge of training and finance.\nRegional commands were to be set up in each of the provinces and, below them,\nlocal commands and cells. The most readily available source of recruits would\nbe ANC or Communist Party members. An MK constitution was drawn up,\ndevised largely by Mandela and Slovo.\nThe bomb-making end of the enterprise was also progressing. Hodgson had\ndiscovered that permanganate of potash, more commonly used in washing\nlettuce, mixed with aluminium powder and catalysed by a drop of acid, could\n\n\fmake an effective explosion. Sacks of permanganate of potash were duly\ntransported to his fourth-floor flat. \u2018We spent days with mortars and pestles\ngrinding this substance to a fine powder,\u2019 recalled Slovo. \u2018Permanganate of\npotash permeated walls, curtains, carpets, and every crevice.\u2019 Fortunately,\nHodgson\u2019s wife, Rica, was as ardent a revolutionary as her husband.\nHodgson also constructed timing devices using the thin plastic tubing\ncontained in ballpoint pens. Large quantities were purchased for the purpose:\n\u2018Every drawer,\u2019 recalled Rica Hodgson, \u2018seemed to be full of ballpoint pens.\u2019 He\nfashioned an incendiary device by using a small bottle of acid and covering the\ntop with a specific thickness of cardboard or paper. Just before placing the\ndevice in the target area, the saboteur had to turn the bottle upside down.\nWhen the time came for the bombs to be tested, Mandela insisted on\nwitnessing the event. The site chosen was a brickworks near Kempton Park, to\nthe east of Johannesburg, owned by Wolfie Kodesh\u2019s brother and not in use at\nthe time. Explosions there during the day, to loosen clay, were a normal\noccurrence. Taking with them a dozen Molotov cocktails and an improvised\nbomb, Mandela, Hodgson, Kodesh and an obliging chemist who had supplied\nMK with gun-powder and nitroglycerine, drove off one morning in a large \nChevrolet to the brickworks to see the results of their handiwork. The site was\ndeserted except for a solitary watchman who was taken to one side by Mandela\nand persuaded to walk away for a while.\nHodgson first tried out the Molotov cocktails\u2014petrol bombs\u2014on one of the\nbrickworks\u2019 buildings and then chose a pit in an open space to test the bomb. He\nhad calculated that the device would explode in fifteen minutes, but after twenty\nminutes nothing had happened. Hodgson retrieved the bomb from the bottom of\nthe pit, adjusted the charge and put the bomb back. Suddenly, a huge explosion\nrent the air, throwing up clouds of dust and earth. In an instant the conspirators\nfled the scene, piling into the Chevrolet and driving helter-skelter out of the\nbrickworks. Mandela was buoyed up by the event. This was the first explosion\nof the campaign.\nThe first group of recruits was dispatched to China for training in guerrilla\nwarfare through an arrangement that the Communist Party had already made\nwith their colleagues in Peking. The recruits included Raymond Mhlaba, a trade\nunionist and Communist Party organiser from Port Elizabeth who had played a\nprominent role there during the Defiance Campaign; Joe Gqabi, a reporter for\n\n\fNew Age who had joined one of the first communist sabotage units before MK\nwas formed; and Wilton Mkwayi, another trade unionist and former treason\ntrialist who had escaped into the underground during the trial.\nAmid all these preparations, there was a growing sense of urgency. Other\narmed groups were beginning to surface to challenge the government.\nSupporters of the banned Pan-Africanist Congress in the Western Cape were in\nthe process of forming a military wing called Poqo, a Xhosa expression meaning\n\u2018alone\u2019 or \u2018pure\u2019, to emphasise their African origins, still intending to liberate\nSouth Africa by . An odd assortment of dissident whites led by Monty\nBerman, a communist recently expelled from the party who had dreamed up the\nidea of establishing his own guerrilla outfit while detained in Pretoria prison\nduring the state of emergency, banded together to form the National Committee\nof Liberation and announced their presence in October by dismantling a pylon\ncarrying power lines in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg, disrupting\ntelephone services and burning down a government office. This was the terrain\non which MK wanted to establish its own reputation.\nYet however anxious MK enthusiasts were to get started, they were\nconstrained by an unexpected development. On  October , Chief Luthuli\nwas nominated winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his determined\nefforts to gain political rights for Afri - cans through nonviolent means. The\naward was a serious blow for the government, which had endeavoured to portray\nLuthuli as the head of a dangerous communist conspiracy. But it also came at an\nawkward time for MK\u2019s high command, for to launch the armed struggle just\nwhen the ANC\u2019s leader had achieved international recognition for his\ncontribution to peace could have resulted in international humiliation for\nLuthuli. No action could be started at least until the award ceremony in Oslo had\ntaken place on  December.\nThe date finally set for the start of the sabotage campaign was  December\n, a day then known as the Day of the Covenant, on which whites celebrated\ntheir victory over the Zulu chief Dingane at the Battle of Blood River in .\nLeaflets dropped on the streets announced the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe\nwith the warning, \u2018The time comes in the life of any nation when there remain\nonly two choices: submit or fight. That time has now come to South Africa.\u2019 The\nleaflets added:\nWe hope, even at this late hour, that our first actions will awaken everyone to a\n\n\frealization of the disastrous situation to which the Nationalist policy is leading.\nWe hope that we will bring the government and its supporters to their senses\nbefore it is too late, so that both the government and its policies can be changed\nbefore matters reach the desperate stage of civil war.\nBombs exploded that night at government buildings in Johannesburg, Durban\nand Port Elizabeth. But not everything went according to plan. Slovo\u2019s\nassignment was to plant one of Hodgson\u2019s incendiary devices in the\nJohannesburg Drill Hall, where the preparatory examination of the treason trial\nhad taken place:\nI had reconnoitred it on more than one occasion and had chosen the spot which\nwould have ignited not only the enormous wooden floor but also the hundreds of\nwooden chairs which covered it. But when the moment came, I found the\nmilitary authorities had decided to have their monthly spring-clean. I entered the\nhall through a side door and found myself in the presence of about fifty black\ncleaners who were removing the chairs and polishing the floor.\nSlovo found another suitable spot, an office with huge wooden cupboards. He\nturned the bottle of the incendiary device upside down, which gave him fifteen\nminutes for a getaway, and was about to place the carrier bag behind one of the\ncupboards when a clipped military voice came from behind him: \u2018Can I do\nanything for you, sir?\u2019\nSlovo was ready with an excuse about looking for an officer who could deal\nwith an administrative problem about call-up papers for his brother and duly\nfollowed the sergeant-major in search of the officer: \u2018I did so with racing pulse,\nknowing that the acid in that small bottle had begun to eat away at the flimsy\ncardboard. Had our kitchen laboratory calculated the fifteen minutes correctly?\u2019\nFortunately, the officer had left the building and Slovo was politely advised\nby the sergeant-major to come back another day. \u2018I gave him a sweaty hand and\nwalked briskly away. As soon as I decently could, I opened the tennis-ball\ncylinder box which housed all the ingredients and snatched the bottle. The three\nor four minutes which preceded this were perhaps the longest in my life.\u2019\nBen Turok, part of a three-man unit which included Harold Wolpe, was less\nfortunate. His assignment was the Native Law Courts, then housed in the same\nbuilding as the Rissik Street post office. When Hodgson arrived in his car at an\nagreed spot to deliver an incendiary device to Turok, he was clearly still having\ntrouble with the devices; one of them had caught fire prematurely on the way,\n\n\fleaving the outside wrapping of Turok\u2019s parcel charred. Turok re - wrapped the\ndevice in an old paper packet which he found in the boot of his own car and\nwent on his way to the Native Law Courts. The device briefly caught alight but\nsoon fizzled out due to a lack of oxygen. The police found it virtually intact with\nfingerprints on the outside wrapping. Five months later, when Turok was\narrested in a police raid intended to disrupt an antigovernment demonstration,\nthe police found by chance that his fingerprints matched those on the Rissik\nStreet bomb package. He was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment. His\ndefence team included Slovo and his co-conspirator, Harold Wolpe.\nAnother bomb device on  December also proved faulty, blowing up\nprematurely at the municipal office in Dube, an African township south of\nJohannesburg, killing one saboteur and injuring another. However, the overall\nresult was judged to be successful.\nYet there was a large measure of improvisation to all this which went far\nbeyond the crude home-made bombs that were used in the campaign. In the\nexcitement to strike a blow at the government, armed activity was seen to be the\nonly meaningful form of action worth pursuing; the need for political\nmobilisation, as Kotane had urged, was neglected. Harold Wolpe, Slovo\u2019s\nclosest friend, was later scathing in his criticism: \u2018We weren\u2019t prepared at a\ntechnical level, or at the level of political strategy. We had no knowledge, no\nbackground, we were just na\u00efve.\u2019 Turok was equally succinct: \u2018We threw the\nfirst bombs without having an underground.\u2019\n\nThree weeks after MK had initiated its sabotage campaign, Mandela left South\nAfrica to canvass for foreign support for armed struggle. He was taken by car\nacross the border into Bechuanaland, a British protectorate, on  January \nand did not return for six months. He had never been abroad before and found\nthe experience of being a \u2018free man\u2019 for the first time exhilarating: \u2018Though I\nwas a fugitive and wanted in my own land, I felt the burden of oppression lifting\nfrom my shoulders.\u2019\nMost of his time was spent in Africa. He travelled from one country to\nanother, seeking financial assistance, political recognition and military training\nfacilities from governments known to be sympathetic to the liberation cause.\nMuch preliminary groundwork had been done by Oliver Tambo, who had set up\nan exile base in London after his departure from South Africa in  and had\n\n\fsince established ANC offices in Tanganyika, Ghana and Egypt.\nFrom the start, however, Mandela found himself competing for attention with\nthe Pan-Africanist Congress, which had also established connections across\nAfrica and had expended considerable effort in denouncing the ANC as a\ncommunist-front organisation. Time and again, Mandela encountered deep\nsuspicions in African states about the ANC\u2019s links with white and Indian\ncommunists. \u2018There is a widespread feeling that the ANC is a communistdominated organization, \u2019 he reported. There was a far wider understanding of\nthe PAC\u2019s objectives of African rule in South Africa than the ANC\u2019s goal of a\nmultiracial democracy. Since the Sharpeville massacre, the PAC\u2019s standing in\nAfrica had risen higher than that of the ANC.\nAt his first stop in the newly independent state of Tanganyika, Mandela was\ndismayed to hear President Nyerere suggest that perhaps the armed struggle\nshould be postponed until Robert Sobukwe, the PAC leader then serving a threeyear sentence for incitement, came out of prison. \u2018The PAC has started off with\ntremendous advantages ideologically, and has skilfully exploited opposition to\nwhites and partnership,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018Sharpeville boosted them up and the stand of\ntheir leaders during the trial, and the imprisonment of Sobukwe, fostered the\nbelief that they were more militant than the ANC.\u2019\nIn Addis Ababa in February, Mandela addressed a conference of the PanAfrican Freedom Movement for East, Central and Southern Africa, a joint\norganisation of independent African states and liberation movements. The\nquestion was often asked, he said, how strong was the liberation struggle in\nSouth Africa?\nThe view has been expressed in some quarters outside South Africa that,\nin the special situation obtaining in our country, our people will never\nwin freedom through their own efforts. Those who hold this view point\nto the formidable apparatus of force and coercion in the hands of the\ngovernment, to the size of its armies, the fierce suppression of civil\nliberties and the persecution of political opponents of the regime.\nConsequently, in these quarters, we are urged to look for our salvation\nbeyond our borders. Nothing could be further from the truth.\nHe acknowledged the importance of outside help, but added, \u2018We believe it\nwould be fatal to create the illusion that external pressures render it unnecessary\nfor us to tackle the enemy from within. The centre and cornerstone of the\n\n\fstruggle for freedom and democracy in South Africa lies inside South Africa\nitself.\u2019\nBefore leaving Addis Ababa, Mandela arranged with the Ethiopian military to\nreturn later in the year for six months\u2019 military training to equip himself as a\nprofessional guerrilla leader. \u2018If there was to be guerrilla warfare,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\nwanted to be able to stand and fight with my people and to share the hazards of\nwar with them.\u2019\nFrom Ethiopia, he travelled to Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Guinea, Sierra\nLeone, Liberia, Ghana and Senegal. Along the way, he kept notes in meticulous\ndetail of all the ideas, information and offers of help he received. His notes on\nconsultations with Algerian officers based in Morocco in March ran to ninetyfour pages. Under a section headed \u2018Funds\u2019, he wrote:\n\u00a3, from Nigeria\n\u00a3, in Tunisia\n\u00a3, in Liberia will be yearly amount\n\u00a3, in Ethiopia\nDefinite promises from Senegal and the Sudan\nAll these monies were sent to O.R [Tambo] in London\nMoney collecting is a job which requires a lot of time. You must be prepared to\nwait.\nVisit to Socialist countries has become imperative\nIn June, Mandela visited London for ten days, enjoying the atmosphere of\nBritish style and manners which his school education had taught him to regard\nso highly. He met the Labour Party leader, Hugh Gaitskell, the Liberal Party\nleader, Jo Grimond, and the editor of the Observer, David Astor, whose\nnewspaper took a close interest in African affairs. Accompanied by Tambo and\nMary Benson, a South African writer, he went sightseeing to the Houses of\nParliament and Westminster Abbey and took a boat ride on the Thames to\nChelsea.\nThen he returned to Addis Ababa to prepare himself for guerrilla war. He\nlearned how to use an automatic rifle and a pistol, listened to lectures on tactics\nand strategy, and gained experience of bombs and mortars. Entries in his diary\n\n\frecorded:\nJune th: First lesson on demolition. Instructor Lt. Befikadu June th: I have\npractice in demolition\nJuly th: A demonstration on mortar fire\nJuly th: We spend  hours at the shooting range\nJuly th: I spend the day doing fieldcraft drills\nJuly th: Lt. Befikadu and I cover  kilometres in fatigue marches. We do it in\n hours.\nBut Mandela\u2019s training programme was cut short abruptly after three weeks\nby a message from Sisulu in Johannesburg insisting that he return to South\nAfrica. Sisulu was concerned that Mandela\u2019s prolonged absence abroad would\ngive rise to suspicions that he did not intend to return to South Africa, as he had\nrepeatedly committed himself to do. The main purpose of Mandela\u2019s trip abroad,\nas Sisulu understood it, was for him to make connections there, not to get\ninvolved in military training. As a farewell gesture, the Ethiopians presented\nMandela with an automatic pistol and  rounds of ammunition.\nDuring the six months that he had been away, sabotage attacks had continued\nsporadically. Most of the attempts were clumsy and ineffectual, none causing\nany lasting damage. The white electorate, on the rare occasions that it was\nalerted to the danger of sabotage attacks, reacted by demanding tougher\nmeasures from the government, not, as Mandela had calculated, by calling for\nreform.\nThe government duly responded. In June, Vorster introduced the General Law\nAmendment Act of , or the \u2018Sabotage\u2019 Act, as it was usually called, which\ngave new definitions to the meaning of sabotage. Acts of sabotage henceforth\nincluded such offences as tampering with property, possessing firearms,\nhindering essential services, putting up a poster and unlawful entry. The\nminimum penalty laid down for offences under the Sabotage Act was five years\u2019\nimprisonment; the maximum was death.\nVorster was further empowered to order the \u2018house arrest\u2019 of anyone he\nbelieved to be a threat to security. He could prohibit persons banned or listed\nunder the Suppression of Communism Act from preparing anything for\npublication, from communicating with each other, from having visitors, from\n\n\fjoining organisations, from attending social gatherings.\nThe security police were also gaining in experience, building up a network of\ninformers and keeping an ever-tighter watch on the movement of activists.\nWalter Sisulu was arrested by Warrant Officer Dirker six times in . Once,\nwhen police were raiding his home, a reporter arrived and asked why they were\nraiding. \u2018Just routine,\u2019 a police officer told him. \u2018We just want to see what Sisulu\nkeeps in his house.\u2019 But the conspirators, used to treating the Special Branch\nwith contempt, neither anticipated the improvement in their techniques nor paid\nmuch attention when they did notice it. CAPTURE\nMANDELA CROSSED THE BORDER FROM BECHUANALAND AT\nNIGHT in an Austin car belonging to a prominent white activist, the theatre\nproducer and playwright Cecil Williams. Williams, a debonair figure, always\nimmaculately dressed, had played a leading role in the establishment of the\nCongress of Democrats and had been incarcerated in Pretoria prison during the\nstate of emergency. It was thought safe for him to collect Mandela from\nBechuanaland since his car had only recently been purchased and would\ntherefore not be familiar to security police. The guise in which they travelled,\nMandela the chauffeur driving his boss home to Johannesburg, was spoilt\nslightly by Mandela\u2019s determination to wear the khaki training uniform he had\nbeen using in Ethiopia.\nThey reached Lilliesleaf at dawn and the following night Mandela held a long\nmeeting with other members of the ANC\u2019s working committee, including Sisulu,\nKotane, Marks and Nokwe, briefing them on the results of his travels. A major\nconcern was the criticism Mandela had encountered throughout Africa of the\nANC\u2019s links with communists and its cooperation with whites and Indians.\nMandela was convinced that, to circumvent foreign hostility, the ANC needed to\ndistance itself from its Congress allies and assume a leading role of its own,\npublicly re-establishing its African credentials. He proposed that he should visit\nLuthuli at his home in Natal to ascertain his views. The working committee\napproved the idea.\nBut Kathrada\u2019s support committee thought the risks were far too high. \u2018We\nworked on the assumption that the police knew he was back in the country,\u2019 said\nKathrada. \u2018We thought we should be extra careful, much more careful than we\nhad been before his departure to Africa. We thought we should first send an\nadvance party.\u2019 Kathrada himself volunteered to do the advance work, but\nMandela opposed the idea. He wanted to leave for Natal as soon as possible. He\nsuggested that he drive down to Durban with Cecil Williams in the Austin car.\nKathrada again voiced his objections to the plan\u2014\u2018Cecil Williams was a marked\n\n\fman\u2019\u2014but he was overruled. Kathrada could not even persuade Mandela to\nshave off his Guevara-type beard to alter the appearance by which he had\nbecome familiar from press photographs; Mandela relished the image it gave\nhim of being a revolutionary leader.\nBefore leaving, Mandela arranged to meet Winnie. It was, Winnie recalled, \u2018a\nhurried meeting . . . our last private moments together\u2019. In Mandela\u2019s absence,\nWinnie had become the target of constant police harassment. She told a\nnewspaper reporter in June:\nThe police have been making visits and searched at my house every night for\nalmost three weeks. Whenever my children and I are about to sleep, Security\nBranch police arrive. They ask me where my husband is and sometimes search\nthe house. Sometimes they joke and at other times they are aggressive, which\nfrightens the children. There are rumours that Nelson is back, but I have not seen\nor heard from him.\nIn the company of Williams, Mandela sped off to Durban to sound out two\nIndian friends, Monty Naicker, the Indian Congress leader, and Ismail Meer,\nbefore travelling on to Groutville to meet Luthuli. Both Naicker and Meer were\nclose friends of the chief and Mandela wanted to be able to tell Luthuli that he\nhad already spoken to them about his proposal. Both opposed any move that\nwould unravel the Congress alliance.\nIn Groutville, Mandela met Luthuli in an Indian-owned house. Luthuli was in\nthe fourth year of a five-year banning order restricting him to his home in the\nUmvoti Mission Reserve. As president of the banned ANC, known to be in\ntouch with ANC envoys and couriers who visited him from time to time, he was\nunder frequent surveillance by the police. Luthuli listened to Mandela\u2019s\nargument and agreed to think about what he had said.\nMandela returned to Durban for further secret meetings and also found time\nfor a quick rendezvous with one of Winnie\u2019s sisters, a nurse. At an Indian house\nin Reservoir Hills, he met members of the MK regional command, briefing them\non his trip abroad and listening to their complaints about the lack of finance and\ntransport. He assured them that help would be forthcoming. One of the members\npresent was Bruno Mtolo, a trade unionist trained in sabotage activity by Jack\nHodgson. \u2018We left Mandela feeling very much heartened and ready to continue\nthe struggle,\u2019 he said.\nLater that evening, Mandela was given a \u2018welcome home\u2019 party at the home\n\n\fof a photo-journalist, G. R. Naidoo, with whom he was staying. Among the\nfriends who came were the Meers, the Singhs and Monty Naicker. \u2018Nelson cut a\nlarge military figure in khaki, his laugh booming the familiar welcome as he\nembraced each friend,\u2019 wrote Fatima Meer, in her account of the party. \u2018They\ndrank and ate and discussed politics. They laughed a lot, excited by their\nintrigue. The police were looking for Nelson and here they were partying with\nhim, virtually under their noses.\u2019\nThe next afternoon,  August, Mandela rejoined Cecil Williams for the\njourney back to Johannesburg. Along the way, they discussed sabotage plans.\nMandela noticed that the main Durban-Johannesburg railway ran parallel to the\nroad for some distance, making it a suitable target for sabotage. As was his habit,\nhe made a note of the idea in a small notebook he invariably carried with him. In\nthe notebook were jottings of ideas he had heard and conversations he had had in\nthe last few days, implicating people whom he had met. Mandela was also\ncarrying a loaded revolver.\nAt the small town of Cedara near Howick, their car, with Williams at the\nwheel and Mandela in the passenger seat, was overtaken and stopped by police\ncars. For a brief moment, Mandela thought of trying to escape up a wooded bank\nto his left, but decided against it. He quickly hid the gun and the notebook in the\ngap between the two front seats. A police officer came directly to the window by\nthe passenger\u2019s seat and asked who he was. \u2018David Motsamayi,\u2019 replied\nMandela, using his alias. The officer asked him other questions about where he\nwas going and where he had come from. Mandela gave him a few perfunctory\nanswers, but the officer soon lost patience: \u2018Ag, you\u2019re Nelson Mandela, and this\nis Cecil Williams, and you are under arrest!\u2019 Mandela and Williams were taken\nto Pietermaritzburg. The hidden notebook and the revolver were never\ndiscovered by the police.\nMandela\u2019s arrest caused turmoil among the conspirators. \u2018There was a great\ndeal of panic,\u2019 recalled Sisulu. Wolfie Kodesh was deputed to find Winnie at the\noffices of the Child Welfare Society in Fox Street in central Johannesburg,\nwhere she worked. He came across her as she was about to leave the building.\nWinnie recalled:\nThe way this man looked! He was white like a ghost, his hair was standing on\nend. I noticed he hadn\u2019t shaved and was wearing a dirty shirt and trousers as if\nhe\u2019d just jumped out of bed; you could see something drastic had happened. This\n\n\fwas one of the men who used to be along the line when I was taken to see\nNelson underground.\n\u2018Winnie could see by the expression on my face that something terrible had\nhappened,\u2019 said Kodesh. \u2018She asked, \u201cIs it Nelson?\u201d I said, \u201cYes. We think he\u2019ll\nbe appearing in the Johannesburg court tomorrow.\u201d\u2019\nEveryone was convinced that Mandela had been betrayed. Suspicion about\nwho the culprit was ran wild. Even Sisulu was suspected in some quarters, for it\nwas he who had insisted that Mandela should return to South Africa.\nThere were persistent rumours that the United States Central Intelligence\nAgency was involved. Mandela\u2019s links with communists had made him a target\nfor US officials embroiled with the Soviet Union in a murky struggle for\ninfluence in a number of newly independent African states and obsessed with the\nneed to contain communist encroachment in Africa. The CIA was active\nthroughout southern Africa, keeping track of the activities of liberation\nmovements there, determined to prevent what it saw as communist-supported\narmed intervention \u2018under the guise of African liberation\u2019. It found an ally in the\nSouth African government, which was only too willing to collaborate.\nIntelligence information was exchanged on a regular basis.\nThe CIA covert-operations section in Johannesburg had expended\nconsiderable energy penetrating the ANC. Its chief undercover agent, Millard\nShirley, the son of American missionaries who had been born in South Africa,\nhad cultivated contacts at all levels of the organisation. A stocky, balding figure,\nwith a reputation as a heavy drinker and a womaniser, he passed himself off as a\nreporter for an American television news network, readily gaining access to\ndissident groups. He was known by South African intelligence to possess a highranking \u2018deep throat\u2019\u2014a Durban-based Indian in the ranks of the Communist\nParty there.\nTwo pieces of evidence subsequently came to light linking the CIA to\nMandela\u2019s arrest. The first concerned the local CIA agent in Durban at the time,\nDon Rickard, a consular officer who, at the end of his tour in South Africa, was\nheard boasting at a diplomatic party of the role that he had played in Mandela\u2019s\narrest. The second concerned Paul Eckel, the CIA station chief based at the U.S.\nEmbassy in Pretoria. Eckel, who died in , confided what had happened to\nanother U.S. official, and in  that official, then retired, told an American\njournalist, Joseph Albright, what Eckel had said: \u2018We turned Mandela over to the\n\n\fSouth African Security Branch. We gave them every detail, what he would be\nwearing, the time of day, just where he would be. They picked him up. It was\none of our greatest coups.\u2019\nGiven Mandela\u2019s amateurish conduct in the days before his arrest, it was\nequally possible that the South African police already knew of his whereabouts\nfrom their own efforts. Mandela had been carried away by romantic notions of\nhis role as \u2018Commander-in-Chief \u2019, the showman of the law courts now wanting\nto become the showman of the battlefield, wearing army fatigues and khaki,\ncarrying a gun, though never intending to use it, flaunting his presence at\ngatherings of the faithful. These were dangerous pretensions at such a time. In\nall, Mandela survived in the field in South Africa as head of Umkhonto since its\nlaunching in December  for no more than five weeks. And in that time, as a\nresult of keeping notebooks, he came close to incriminating a considerable\nnumber of other people.\nHe chastised himself for his own foolhardy behaviour. \u2018In truth, I had been\nimprudent about maintaining the secrecy of my movements,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018In\nretrospect, I realized the authorities could have had a myriad of ways of locating\nme on my trip to Durban. It was a wonder in fact that I wasn\u2019t captured sooner.\u2019\nWhen asked in later years about evidence of the CIA\u2019s involvement in his arrest,\nhis response was, \u2018Let bygones be bygones. Let\u2019s forget about that, whether it is\ntrue or not.\u2019\n\nWhatever suspicions the security police had about Mandela, they possessed no\nevidence linking him to the sabotage campaign. When he appeared in the\nmagistrates\u2019 court in Johannesburg on  August, he was charged on two counts:\nfirst, inciting workers in essential occupations to act illegally; and second,\nleaving the country without a valid travel permit. Mandela decided to represent\nhimself, as this gave him the opportunity to turn the trial into an attack on the\ngovernment, and chose Slovo as his legal adviser.\nWhile Mandela was held in the Fort awaiting trial, Slovo used his access to\nhim as his legal adviser to plot his escape. The conspirators at Rivonia spent\nhours floating schemes to smuggle him out of the Fort. In the end they decided\nthat the Fort was impregnable, but that the Johannesburg magistrates\u2019 court\noffered better possibilities.\n\n\fDuring the lunch break, when court proceedings were adjourned, the accused\nwere taken down steps leading to a basement, where they were locked in\nindividual cells. All that was needed to spring Mandela was a key enabling him\nto leave the basement, climb the steps to the deserted courtroom above and from\nthere reach the street outside, where a getaway car would be waiting. To ensure\nthat Mandela was not recognised, a disguise would be smuggled in to him\u2014a\nwig, moustache and beard. Slovo was given the task of obtaining measurements\nfor the disguise during his frequent visits to the Fort. As he and Mandela sat in\nan interview room, attended by a prison warder, they exchanged written notes\nand bits of cotton until eventually, after several weeks, all the measurements\nwere gathered. The disguise was duly made by a professional wigmaker and\nsmuggled to Mandela by Winnie sewn in the shoulder padding of his finest suit.\nHe was also given the vital key. Wolfie Kodesh was briefed to provide the\ngetaway car.\nMandela, however, changed his mind about the feasibility of the escape plan,\nconcluding that if it failed it would do fatal damage to the ANC. In a note to\nSlovo passed across the desk in the interview room, he explained his views,\nadding at the end, \u2018Please destroy this after you have finished reading it.\u2019 But\nSlovo decided that the note was interesting enough to be saved as a historical\ndocument and it was to reappear in unfortunate circumstances. As it happened,\ntwo days before the trial was due to open on  October in Johannesburg, the\nauthorities decided to switch the venue to Pretoria.\nCongress supporters had meanwhile set up a Free Mandela Committee and\norganised a series of rallies under the slogan \u2018Free Mandela\u2019. To prevent further\ndemonstrations, the government prohibited \u2018any gathering related to Mandela in\nany place in the Republic of South Africa\u2019 for two days at the beginning of his\ntrial. On  October, it banned all gatherings in protest at the arrest or trial of\nanyone for any offence for a period of six months.\nMandela\u2019s appearance in court at the Old Synagogue on  October caused a\nsensation. He entered wearing a traditional Xhosa leopard-skin kaross instead of\na suit and tie. In the spectators\u2019 gallery, the crowd of his supporters rose to their\nfeet with shouts of \u2018Amandla!\u2019\u2014\u2018Power!\u2019\u2014and \u2018Ngawethu!\u2019\u2014\u2018It is ours!\u2019\nWinnie was among them, wearing a traditional beaded headdress and a long,\nembroidered Xhosa skirt. Mandela saluted in acknowledgement, with a clenched\nfirst raised high, and turned to smile at Winnie.\n\n\fOn each day that Mandela appeared in court he wore the same kaross. When\nthe prison authorities tried to confiscate it from him, he retorted that they had no\njurisdiction over his attire in court and threatened to take the matter as far as the\nSupreme Court if they interfered. All they managed to do was to prevent him\nfrom wearing it on his way to the court from prison and back.\nRight from the start, Mandela sought to place the government and its system\nof justice on trial rather than himself. Given permission to address the court\nbefore he was asked to plead, he immediately asked for the recusal of the\nmagistrate, J. van Heerden, on the grounds that he did not consider himself\nlegally or morally bound to obey laws made by a parliament in which he had no\nrepresentation. Nor did he believe he would receive a fair and proper trial:\nIn a political trial such as this one, which involves a clash of the aspirations of\nthe African people and those of whites, the country\u2019s courts, as presently\nconstituted, cannot be impartial and fair. In such cases, whites are interested\nparties. To have a white judicial officer presiding, however high his esteem, and\nhowever strong his sense of fairness and justice, is to make whites judges in their\nown case. It is improper and against the elementary principles of justice to\nentrust whites with cases involving the denial by them of basic human rights to\nthe African people . . .\nNo African, he said, enjoyed equality before the law.\nThe white man makes all the laws, he drags us before his courts and\naccuses us, and he sits in judgement over us.\nIt is fit and proper to raise the question sharply, what is this rigid\ncolour bar in the administration of justice? Why is it in this courtroom I\nface a white magistrate, am confronted by a white prosecutor and\nescorted in to the dock by a white orderly? Can anyone honestly and\nseriously suggest that in this type of atmosphere the scales of justice are\nevenly balanced?\nWhy is it that no African in the history of this country has ever had the\nhonour of being tried by his own kith and kin, by his own flesh and\nblood?\nI will tell Your Worship why: the real purpose of this rigid colour bar\nis to ensure that the justice dispensed by the courts should conform to the\npolicy of the country, however much that policy might be in conflict with\n\n\fthe norms of justice accepted in judiciaries throughout the civilized world\n...\nI hate discrimination most intensely and in all its manifestations. I\nhave fought it all during my life; I fight it now, and will do so until the\nend of my days. Even although I now happen to be tried by one whose\nopinion I hold in high esteem, I detest most violently the set-up that\nsurrounds me here. It makes me feel that I am a black man in a white\nman\u2019s court. This should not be.\nMandela concluded by explaining that he had decided to speak frankly\nbecause the injustice to which he had referred contained the seeds of \u2018an\nextremely dangerous situation for our country and our people\u2019. \u2018I make no threat\nwhen I say that unless these wrongs are remedied without delay, we might well\nfind that even plain talk before the country\u2019s courts is too timid a method to\ndraw the attention of the country to air political demands.\u2019 His application for\nthe recusal of the magistrate was refused.\nThe prosecution proceeded to produce some sixty witnesses\u2014policemen,\njournalists, township superintendents and printers\u2014who gave evidence about the\npreparations for the three-day strike in May .\nOn the third day of the trial, Mandela made a surprise application once again\nfor the recusal of the magistrate, van Heerden. His legal adviser, Bob Hepple,\nwho had replaced Slovo after the government refused to lift the banning order\nrestricting Slovo to Johannesburg, had noticed during the previous day\u2019s lunch\nbreak that van Heerden had left the courtroom in the company of Warrant\nOfficer Dirker of the Special Branch. Dirker had given evidence on the first day\nof the trial and was due to be cross-examined by Mandela at a later stage.\nTogether with another member of the Special Branch who had been present\nthroughout the trial, assisting the prosecution, they climbed into a blue\nVolkswagen car and sped off for lunch. It was this incident which prompted\nMandela to ask for the magistrate\u2019s recusal. But before doing so, in a gesture of\nremarkable cordiality, he sent van Heerden a private note advising him in\nadvance of the action he was about to take and explaining that there was nothing\npersonal about the matter.\nConfronting him in court, Mandela said that the incident had created the\nimpression that the court had associated itself with the state\u2019s case: \u2018I am left\nwith the substantial fear that justice is being administered in a secret manner. It\n\n\fis an elementary rule of justice that a judicial officer should not communicate or\nassociate in any manner whatsoever with a party to these proceedings. I submit\nthat Your Worship should not have acted in this fashion.\u2019\nVan Heerden\u2019s reply was brief: \u2018I can only say this, that it is not for me to\ngive you reasons. I can assure you, as I here now do, that I did not communicate\nwith these two gentlemen, and your application is refused.\u2019\nOn the fourth day of the trial, the prosecution closed its case and Mandela rose\nto present his defence. He had given the court the impression that he would call a\nlarge number of witnesses. But he had long since decided to call none. He knew\nthat the charges were accurate and he had already made the statement about the\nunfairness of the political and legal system that he wanted to make. Instead of\ncalling witnesses, he said simply, \u2018Your Worship, I submit that I am guilty of no\ncrimes.\u2019\nThere was a considerable pause, then the magistrate, clearly taken aback,\nasked, \u2018Is that all you have to say?\u2019\n\u2018Your Worship, with respect, if I had something more to say, I would have\nsaid it.\u2019\nThe court was adjourned until  November, when, in accordance with court\nprocedure, Mandela was to be allowed to address the court with a plea in\nmitigation before the magistrate gave his sentence.\nOn  November, before the court was called into session, Mandela and Hepple\nwere conferring in an office in the Old Synagogue when the prosecutor, P. J.\nBosch, came in and asked for a private meeting with Mandela. He apologised for\nhaving to ask the court to send him to prison and reached out to shake his hand.\nWhen Bosch walked out of the room, Hepple noticed that he was in tears.\nThe court was packed again with spectators. Winnie was present, in Xhosa\ndress, as well as a number of Mandela\u2019s relatives from the Transkei. As Mandela\ntook his place in the dock, he turned to the gallery, raising his arm in a clenchedfist salute, and called out \u2018Amandla!\u2019 The crowd rose and responded:\n\u2018Ngawethu!\u2019\nThe magistrate read out his judgement. Mandela, he said, was \u2018the leader,\ninstigator, figurehead, main mouthpiece and the brain\u2019 behind the organisation\nwhich had called the  strike. \u2018To incite people to commit a crime by forcing\nthem to protest a law was the same as committing the crime itself,\u2019 he continued.\n\n\fMandela had shown no remorse but seemed proud of his achievements and had\nstated in no uncertain terms that he would continue his activities whatever the\nsentence passed on him. \u2018We are living under abnormal and trying conditions,\u2019\nthe magistrate said, and if law and order were not maintained, anarchy would\nreign; the court was not concerned with politics but with the maintenance of law\nand order.\nMandela followed with an hour-long address to the court intended not as a\nplea in mitigation but as a political testament explaining why he had taken the\naction which had led to his trial and why he would do it again if necessary:\nThe whole life of any thinking African in this country drives him continuously to\na conflict between his conscience on the one hand and the law on the other. . . .\nThe law as it is applied, the law as it has been developed over a long period of\nhistory and especially the law as it is written and designed by the Nationalist\ngovernment is a law which, in our view, is immoral, unjust and intolerable. Our\nconsciences dictate that we must protest against it, that we must oppose it and\nthat we must attempt to alter it . . .\nThroughout its fifty-year existence the ANC had done everything possible to\nbring its demands to the attention of successive South African governments. It\nhad sought at all times peaceful solutions for the country\u2019s ills and problems.\nEvery attempt had been treated with contempt and met by force. In , as\nsecretary of the Action Council, he had approached the prime minister seeking to\ngain support for a national convention. But he had not even been treated with the\ncourtesy of an acknowledgement. Instead,\nthe government . . . set out, from the beginning of this campaign, not to treat\nwith us, not to heed us, nor to talk to us, but rather to present us as wild,\ndangerous revolutionaries, intent on disorder and riot, incapable of being dealt\nwith in any way save by mustering an overwhelming force against us and the\nimplementation of every possible forcible means, legal and illegal, to suppress\nus. The government behaved in a way no civilized government should dare\nbehave when faced with a peaceful, disciplined, sensible and democratic\nexpression of the views of its own population. It ordered the mobilization of its\narmed forces to attempt to cow and terrorize our peaceful protest. It arrested\npeople known to be active in African politics and in support of African demands\nfor democratic rights, passed special laws enabling it to hold them without trial\nfor twelve days. . . . If there was a danger during this period that violence would\n\n\fresult from the situation in the country, then the possibility was of the\ngovernment\u2019s making. They set the scene for violence by relying exclusively on\nviolence with which to answer our people and their demands . . .\nHe warned of the danger of further violence to come:\nGovernment violence can do only one thing and that is to breed counterviolence. We have warned repeatedly that the government, by resorting\ncontinually to violence, will breed, in this country, counter-violence amongst the\npeople, till ultimately, if there is no dawning of sanity on the part of the\ngovernment\u2014ultimately, the dispute between the government and my people\nwill finish up by being settled in violence and by force. Already there are\nindications in this country that people, my people, Africans, are turning to\ndeliberate acts of violence and of force against the government in order to\npersuade the government, in the only language which this government shows by\nits own behaviour, that it understands. . . .\nPerhaps the court will say that despite our human rights to protest, to object, to\nmake ourselves heard, we should stay within the letter of the law. I would say,\nsir, that it is the government, its administration of the law, which brings the law\ninto such contempt and disrepute that one is no longer concerned in this country\nto stay within the letter of the law.\nHis own experience illustrated this: \u2018The government has used the process of\nlaw to handicap me, in my personal life, in my career and in my political work in\na way which is calculated, in my opinion, to bring about a contempt for the\nlaw\u2019\u2014by restricting him, banning him, harassing him.\nBy order of the government, in the name of the law, I found myself\nrestricted and isolated from my fellow men, from people who think like\nme and believe like me. I found myself trailed by officers of the Security\nBranch of the police force wherever I went. In short I found myself\ntreated as a criminal\u2014an unconvicted criminal. I was not allowed to pick\nmy company, to frequent the company of men, to participate in their\npolitical activities, to join their organizations. I was not free from\nconstant police surveillance. I was made, by the law, a criminal, not\nbecause of what I had done, but because of what I stood for, because of\nwhat I thought, because of my conscience.\nCan it be any wonder to anybody that such conditions make a man an\noutlaw of society? Can it be wondered that such a man, having been\n\n\foutlawed by the government, should be prepared to lead the life of an\noutlaw, as I have led for some months, according to the evidence before\nthis court?\nIt has not been easy for me during that past period to separate myself\nfrom my wife and children, to say goodbye to the good old days when, at\nthe end of a strenuous day at an office, I could look forward to joining\nmy family at the dinner table, and instead to take up the life of a man\nhunted continuously by the police, living separated from those who are\nclosest to me, in my own country, facing continually the hazards of\ndetection and arrest. This has been a life infinitely more difficult than\nserving a prison sentence. No man in his right senses would voluntarily\nchoose such a life in preference to the one of normal, family, social life\nwhich exists in every civilized community.\nBut there comes a time, as it came in my life, when a man is denied the\nright to live a normal life, when he can only live the life of an outlaw\nbecause the government has so decreed to use the law to impose a state\nof outlawry upon him.\nMandela concluded with a passionate denunciation of racial discrimination\nand the system of minority rule in South Africa that went with it:\nI hate the practice of racial discrimination, and in my hatred I am sustained by\nthe fact that the overwhelming majority of mankind hate it equally. . . .\nNothing that this court can do to me will change in any way that hatred in me,\nwhich can only be removed by the removal of the injustice and the inhumanity\nwhich I have sought to remove from the political, social and economic life of\nthis country.\nWhatever sentence Your Worship sees fit to impose upon me for the crime for\nwhich I have been convicted before this court, may it rest assured that when my\nsentence has been completed, I will still be moved, as men are always moved, by\ntheir consciences; I will still be moved by my dislike of the race discrimination\nagainst my people when I come out from serving my sentence, to take up again,\nas best I can, the struggle for the removal of those injustices until they are finally\nabolished once and for all.\nMandela\u2019s articulate defence of African rights, his manner and bearing before\nthe court, his skill in dealing with court officials and witnesses alike, marked\n\n\fhim out as a leader of distinction. No courtroom in South Africa had ever heard\nsuch a powerful indictment of the government. However, the import of his words\nwas largely lost in South Africa at the time. Van Heerden took no more than a\nten-minute adjournment after Mandela had finished his address before\npronouncing sentence. The press coverage was limited. Mandela was on the list\nof persons whose statements could not be published and although the\ngovernment had decreed that reporting of judicial proceedings was permissible\n\u2018as long as it is not abused by creating a forum for such persons\u2019, newspapers\nwere unsure of the consequences. One of Johannesburg\u2019s major newspapers, The\nStar, quoted only a few sentences from his address.\nBut Mandela\u2019s performance, while making little impact in South Africa, had\ngained worldwide attention. His  trial marked the start of his international\nreputation. The pleas that he had made for human rights in South Africa were\nfully understood in Western countries, even if governments there felt little\ninclination at the time to respond. In the short term, none of this was to make any\ndifference. Mandela\u2019s fate was to be sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment for\nincitement and two years\u2019 imprisonment for travelling abroad without valid\ndocuments, five years in all, with no possibility of parole. In the long term,\nhowever, the words that Mandela spoke in the Old Synagogue and the reputation\nhe gained there were to be remembered far beyond any term of imprisonment.\n\nThe net was meanwhile closing in on other conspirators. Walter Sisulu was\narrested two days after Mandela on similar charges of incitement for his role in\norganising the May  strike. He was granted bail by the court, but then\nplaced under twelve-hour house arrest, confined to his house in Orlando between\n. p.m. and . a.m. every day, all weekends and public holidays, required to\nreport to a police station every day and prohibited from receiving any visitors at\nhome. Two weeks later, Sisulu\u2019s mother, who lived with him and whom\nMandela cherished as much as his own, died in the house. When friends and\nrelatives came to mourn, Albertina tried to explain that Sisulu could not speak to\nthem. He made an urgent application to the chief magistrate in Johannesburg for\npermission to receive mourners in his home but was turned down. Later that\nevening, when the visitors had left and the house was in darkness, with the body\nawaiting removal for the funeral the next day, the police raided the house and\narrested Sisulu on charges of violating his house arrest. The charges were later\nwithdrawn.\n\n\fLike Mandela, Sisulu was found guilty of incitement but the sentence he was\ngiven was more severe: six years\u2019 imprisonment rather than three. Sisulu decided\nto appeal and, as the law then required, he was granted bail, pending an appeal.\nThe government responded by placing him under twenty-four-hour house arrest,\nprohibiting him from setting foot outside at any time. A few weeks later, Sisulu\ndisappeared underground. Albertina was subsequently arrested and held in\nsolitary confinement for three months.\nMandela\u2019s bomb-maker, Jack Hodgson, was placed under twenty-four-hour\nhouse arrest in his Hillbrow flat for five years and his wife, Rica, under twelvehour house arrest. As both were banned persons, they needed special ministerial\ndispensation to communicate with each other. The Hodgsons were eventually to\nflee the country. Michael Harmel and Moses Kotane were placed under twentyfour-hour house arrest; Kathy Kathrada, Rusty Bernstein and Cecil Williams\nwere placed under twelve-hour house arrest. So too was the civil rights\ncampaigner Helen Joseph. Several leading figures, including Harmel and\nKotane, made plans to leave. Others, like Kathrada, went underground.\nOne by one, the remnants of radical opposition were obliterated. The\nCongress of Democrats was outlawed in September . All public gatherings\non the Johannesburg City Hall steps, a traditional venue for dissidents, were\nbanned, except for divine services. The radical newspaper New Age was banned\nin November . It reappeared the following week under the name Spark, but\nSpark was soon forced to close as a result of bans imposed on its editorial staff.\nAnother radical journal, Fighting Talk, in which Bernstein had played a\nprominent role, was closed down three months later. A clause in the Sabotage\nAct made it illegal to possess any copies of banned news - papers, with a penalty\nof three years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nUnder Verwoerd\u2019s rule, white society became increasingly insular and inbred. It\nwas a society which expected conformity and so regarded dissent, however\ntrivial, as a form of treachery. \u2018Opposing apartheid,\u2019 observed a prominent\nAfrikaner critic, \u2018is worse than murder to some Afrikaners. You endanger the\nnation by refusing to conform.\u2019\nThe national radio network was turned into a propaganda arm of the National\nParty. Each commentary, each news bulletin conveyed the government\u2019s view of\nthe world. Independent views were rarely heard. \u2018No useful purpose can be\n\n\fserved by causing the public distrust of our leaders\u2019 policies,\u2019 remarked one\ndirector-general of the South African Broadcasting Corporation. All attempts to\nintroduce television were blocked because of the \u2018negative\u2019 effects it might have.\nThe press was exempted from direct controls, but otherwise forced to steer its\nway through a minefield of legislation. Often unsure of what they could print,\neditors resorted more and more to self-censorship. Outright attacks on apartheid\nwere rare. The English-language press continued to expose the worst excesses of\ngovernment policy, but the costs both for newspaper proprietors and for editors\nand reporters were usually high. Under constant official pressure, they slowly\ngave way rather than face statutory controls.\nAn equally tight grip was kept on literature and entertainment. In March ,\nVerwoerd\u2019s government set up a Publications Control Board with power to ban\nany publication, film, record or art show, including the work of South African\nwriters, artists and sculptors. Besides the usual test for obscenity and blasphemy,\na publication could be banned if it brought the country into ridicule or contempt;\nor if it was prejudicial to the safety of the state, the general welfare or peace and\ngood order. Thousands of works were subsequently banned, including those by\nprominent South African and Western writers. In defending the frequent use of\ncensorship laws, government ministers were given to explain that behind many\nprohibited works lurked the menace of communism. \u2018When we think of\nliterature containing filth, then we must think of the communist tactic behind it,\u2019\nsaid the minister of education, arts and science, Jan de Klerk, introducing the\nPublications and Entertainment Bill in . \u2018It is known to the government that\nit is a communist tactic throughout the world to use filth to break the backbone\nof the nation; to use filth to attack a nation on the cultural and social front, to\nparalyse people and make them an easy prey for communism.\u2019\nThrough rigorous control of the media, Verwoerd had little difficulty in\nconvincing most whites that the coalition of forces ranged against South Africa\n\u2014communist states, the Afro-Asian bloc, \u2018leftists\u2019 and \u2018liberals\u2019 in Western\ncountries and revolutionaries from within\u2014was sufficiently threatening to\nwarrant any action the government took to protect the nation. Each new piece of\nlegislation strengthening the government\u2019s hand, each inroad made into civil\nliberties, evoked less and less protest from within the white community. Those\nadvocating concessions or conciliation were simply accused of endangering\nwhite survival. Though government action was often taken in the name of\ndefending Western civilisation, there was never any doubt about what the\n\n\fultimate purpose was. \u2018Our motto,\u2019 declared Verwoerd, \u2018is to maintain white\nsupremacy for all time to come over our own people and our own country, by\nforce if necessary.\u2019\n\nPretoria Local, a large red-brick building behind a crenellated wall on the\nwestern side of the main road leading to Johannesburg, was a familiar place to\nMandela. It had been his home for five months during the  state of\nemergency and also during his trial for incitement. But when he returned there\nfrom the Old Synagogue on  November, it was to a different regime: he was no\nlonger a prisoner awaiting trial but a convicted criminal, and he was treated\naccordingly.\nStill in a fighting mood, he tried to take on the prison authorities in his\ncustomary fashion. Issued with the standard prison uniform for Africans\u2014a pair\nof short trousers, a khaki shirt, a calico jacket and rubber sandals\u2014Mandela\nrefused to wear the short trousers. When dinner arrived\u2014cold, stiff porridge\u2014he\nrefused to eat it and demanded better food. The solution devised for him by the\nprison commander, Colonel Jacobs, was to allow him to wear long trousers and\nto receive better food but to separate him from other prisoners, in solitary\nconfinement. Mandela replied that he had no difficulty with that.\nHe soon learned differently:\nAn hour was like a year. I was locked up in the bare cell, literally with nothing,\nnothing to read, nothing to write, nothing to do, and no one to talk or turn to. I\nwas guarded by two warders during exercise time. The one was an African. I\ntried to talk to him. He spurned me, afraid no doubt of his white colleague. I\nsuffered the isolation for two months and finally concluded that nothing was\nmore dehumanizing than isolation from human companionship.\nSo Mandela exchanged his long trousers and improved rations for the\ncompany of fellow prisoners. He was assigned to a small group of political\nprisoners, a trade unionist, a reporter for New Age and several PAC members,\nincluding Robert Sobukwe.\nSobukwe by now considered himself a veteran of the prison system.\nConvicted of incitement for his role in the anti-pass demonstrations of March\n, he had been moved through a series of prisons\u2014Pretoria Central,\nBoksburg, Stofberg and Witbank\u2014before reaching Pretoria Local in . He\n\n\fwas due for release in May .\nDespite their political rivalry, the two men struck up a cordial relationship in\nprison, choosing to sit next to each other while sewing old mailbags on a\nconcrete ledge in the prison courtyard and addressing each other respectfully by\ntheir clan names. Sobukwe advised caution and patience in dealing with the\nprison system. \u2018You\u2019ve got to pull through five years,\u2019 he told Mandela. \u2018There\nis no point in putting their backs up against you. They can be very vicious.\u2019\nThe conditions in Pretoria Local were primitive. Mandela was given his own\ncell, measuring about six by seven feet, complete with toilet bucket. The cold at\nnight was intense. He slept on a thin sisal mat on a cement floor with only two\nthin blankets for cover. The food was bad and discipline strict. When Mandela\nand Sobukwe went together to see Colonel Jacobs to complain about conditions,\nJacobs dismissed them curtly. Mandela began to argue, but Sobukwe restrained\nhim: \u2018Nel, Nel, don\u2019t be rash. You\u2019ve got to live here.\u2019\n\nWhile Mandela and Sobukwe were sewing mailbags in Pretoria and arguing\nabout whether Shakespeare or George Bernard Shaw was the greatest English\nwriter, South Africa faced a new phenomenon: the underground PAC movement\nknown as Poqo initiated an insurrection against the government which included\nthe murder of whites among its aims. \u2018The white people shall suffer, the black\npeople will rule,\u2019 said a Poqo pamphlet. \u2018Freedom comes after bloodshed.\u2019\nPoqo was poorly organised but inspired a large following, notably in the\nWestern Cape, with visions of an imminent black uprising. Its attacks were\nrandom and haphazard, but they created widespread alarm. Poqo supporters were\nresponsible for the killing of African policemen and informers, for an uprising in\nPaarl in November  in which a mob of  men attacked a police station\nand rampaged through the town killing two whites, and for the murder of five\nwhites, including a woman and two young girls, sleeping at a roadside camp\nnear the Bashee River bridge in the Transkei in February .\nIn March , plans for a more general uprising were prepared by a group of\nPAC leaders based in exile in Maseru, the capital of Basutoland, then a British\nprotectorate. Instructions were sent to Poqo supporters to manufacture their own\nweapons with whatever materials were to hand and to collect food and clothing.\nOn a given date, they were to launch simultaneous attacks on strategic points\n\n\fsuch as police stations and power installations before turning their attention to\nmassacring whites indiscriminately.\nThe plan began to go wrong when Potlake Leballo, a volatile figure who had\ninherited the PAC\u2019s leadership from Sobukwe, gave warning of the uprising two\nweeks before it was due to start at a press conference in Maseru, claiming that\n, armed followers were waiting for his signal. As a result of Leballo\u2019s\nimpetuous announcement, the colonial authorities in Maseru raided the PAC\u2019s\npremises, seized lists of , names, arrested PAC officials and closed down\ntheir office. In South Africa, police began to round up hundreds of PAC\nsupporters. The date set for the uprising passed by with only a few incidents\nreported.\nThe Poqo campaign, together with the sporadic sabotage attacks from\nUmkhonto, gave Verwoerd\u2019s justice minister, John Vorster, the opportunity he\nneeded to acquire virtually unlimited security powers. The General Law\nAmendment Act introduced on  May  empowered the police to arrest\nwithout warrant and detain any person suspected of having committed sabotage,\nor any offences under the Suppression of Communism Act or the Unlawful\nOrganizations Act, and any person suspected of possessing information about\nsuch offences. Detainees could be held in solitary confinement, without access to\nlawyers and family, until they had replied \u2018satisfactorily\u2019 to all questions put by\npolice interrogators. The initial period for which they could be held was ninety\ndays. But the police were entitled to renew the order again and again \u2018until this\nside of eternity\u2019, according to Vorster. The act expressly prohibited the courts\nfrom ordering the release of a detainee. Scores of men and women now vanished\ninto jails, to be subjected to solitary confinement and prolonged interrogation.\nA new breed of police interrogators moved on to the seventh floor of the\nGrays, an oblong concrete block on Von Weilligh Street used by the security\npolice as their headquarters. They were men prepared to use any method\nnecessary to obtain information from detainees. The most notorious of all was\nLieutenant Theunis Swanepoel, a former sergeant previously known for beating\nconfessions out of prisoners, whose ugliness stood out at first sight. A broadshouldered, heavy-set man with close-cropped ginger hair, he had a bullfrog-like\nhead, tiny eyes and a face that was pockmarked and blotched\u2014features that\nwere to become all too familiar to detainees.\nThe interrogators soon began to produce results. A favourite method was\n\n\f\u2018statue\u2019 torture. Detainees were forced to stand in a small chalk square for\nperiods which ranged from six hours to sixty hours. If they tried to sit down,\nthey were jerked to their feet again; and if they fainted or lost consciousness,\nthey were revived and forced to stand again. A communist activist, Ivan\nSchermbrucker, described in a note smuggled out of prison how he was made to\nstand until exhaustion brought him to the ground after twenty-eight hours of\nstanding: \u2018I fell twice, had cold water thrown over me and was pulled to my feet.\n. . . I nearly committed bloody suicide by jumping out of the window. This is\ntorture . . . they threatened to keep me standing for four days and nights and even\nlonger.\u2019 Other methods included electric shocks and physical assaults.\nThe General Law Amendment Act of  effectively marked South Africa\u2019s\ntransformation into a police state. As the legislation passed through parliament, a\nlone MP, Helen Suzman, voted against it. One of its first victims was Robert\nSobukwe. Due for release on  May, having completed his three-year sentence in\nfull, Sobukwe was held under a clause of the act which enabled the minister of\njustice to keep in prison indefinitely anyone convicted under security laws, even\nafter they had served their sentence.\nSobukwe was taken from Pretoria Local to serve his time on Robben Island.\nMandela was soon to follow him there.\n\n\f\f.

Winnie visits Mandela in the police cells a few days after his arrest in August\n OPERATION MAYIBUYE\nFAR FROM BEING DAUNTED BY THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S INCREASING\nUSE of repression, the conspirators were keen to develop more ambitious plans.\nRevolutionary enthusiasts like Slovo argued that the phase of limited sabotage\nhad effectively run its course and that the only remaining option was to commit\nUmkhonto to revolutionary violence. Since the first recruits had been sent out of\nthe country for military training in China in September , some  others\nhad followed for training elsewhere in Africa and in Eastern Europe, providing a\ntrained core of activists ready for guerrilla operations. Arthur Goldreich had\ntravelled to China, the Soviet Union and East Germany, seeking military aid for\nUmkhonto and obtaining information on the manufacture of arms.\nSlovo found a powerful ally for his arguments in Govan Mbeki, a talented\npolitical organiser from Port Elizabeth who had joined the MK high command at\nLilliesleaf Farm after going underground in  to avoid house arrest. A writer\nand journalist, employed by New Age as its Port Elizabeth editor, he had been\npart of the group in the s which had turned Port Elizabeth and other towns\nin the Eastern Cape into one of the most successful areas of ANC activity.\nDetained for five months during the state of emergency in , he had\nsubsequently recruited and run a sabotage unit based in Port Elizabeth until\narrested in  under the Explosives Act on a charge of having instructed men\nin the manufacture of homemade bombs. While being held in prison for five\nmonths, three of them in solitary confinement, he had managed to continue work\non his study of the Transkei, which was later published as The Peasants\u2019 Revolt.\nUnlike other MK activists, he was a staunch believer in the power of the\npeasantry to change South African society and in the importance of rural areas as\nthe main theatre of resistance. Acquitted of the explosives charge, he was served\nwith a house-arrest order, but went underground and based himself at Lilliesleaf.\nAt the age of fifty-two, eight years older than Mandela, Mbeki was a veteran\ncommunist activist, having first been attracted by communism during his days as\na student at Fort Hare in the s. He was a close friend and collaborator of\n\n\fRuth First, Slovo\u2019s wife. And like Slovo, he was a hardline, narrow ideologue,\nunshakeable in his convictions and certainties.\nSlovo and Mbeki began work on a new MK strategy which they completed by\nApril  and which was given the codename Operation Mayibuye. The\nproposals they put forward in their six-page memorandum were on a scale that\nno one had previously contemplated. \u2018The time for small thinking is over,\u2019 they\ndeclared.\nPart  encapsulated their argument for proceeding to guerrilla warfare:\nThe white state has thrown overboard every pretence of rule by democratic\nprocess. Armed to the teeth, it has presented the people with only one choice and\nthat is its overthrow by force and violence. It can now be truly said that very\nlittle, if any, scope exists for the smashing of white supremacy other than by\nmeans of mass revolutionary action, the main content of which is armed\nresistance leading to victory by military means.\nThe political events which have occurred in the last few years have convinced\nthe overwhelming majority of the people that no mass struggle which is not\nbacked up by armed resistance and military offensive operations can hope to\nmake a real impact. This can be seen from the general mood of the people and\ntheir readiness to undertake even desperate and suicidal violent campaigns of the\nLeballo type. It can also be gauged by their reluctance to participate in orthodox\npolitical struggles in which they expose themselves to massive retaliation\nwithout a prospect of hitting back. . . . We are confident that the masses will\nrespond in overwhelming numbers to a lead which holds out a real possibility of\nsuccessful armed struggle. . . .\nThe objective military conditions in which the movement finds itself make the\npossibility of a general uprising leading to direct military struggle an unlikely\none. Rather, as in Cuba, the general uprising must be sparked off by organized\nand well-prepared guerrilla operations during the course of which the masses of\nthe people will be drawn in and armed.\nAfter disposing of the arguments against military action, Slovo and Mbeki\nturned to drawing up detailed plans of operation. Hundreds more activists would\nleave South Africa for guerrilla training. They would return by sea and by air in\ntrained groups, thirty-strong, armed and equipped to be self-sufficient for at least\na month while they linked up with local guerrilla bands: \u2018Our target is that on\narrival the external force should find at least , men in the four main areas to\n\n\fjoin the guerrilla army in the initial onslaught.\u2019 Lists of targets were drawn up.\n\u2018We are convinced that this plan is capable of fulfilment, \u2019 they said. \u2018But only if\nthe whole apparatus of the movement both here and abroad is mobilized for its\nimplementation and if every member now prepares to make unlimited sacrifice\nfor the achievement of our goal.\u2019\nPlans were also drawn up to manufacture hand grenades, bombs and other\narmaments inside South Africa. A new property near Krugersdorp named\nTravallyn was purchased for use as an arsenal. The man given responsibility for\narms manufacture at Travallyn was Denis Goldberg, a thirty-year-old engineer\nfrom a well-known communist family, previously president of the Congress of\nDemocrats. The scale of the operation envisaged at Travallyn was considerable.\n\u2018Production requirements\u2019 were estimated at , land mines, , hand\ngrenades and , time devices for bombs. Goldberg opened negotiations for\nproduction equipment from factory owners, wholesale distributors and\nmachinery merchants, using a string of pseudonyms, and obtained quotations for\niron castings which matched designs for a hand grenade made by Goldreich. He\nalso approached two firms of timber merchants for wood for , boxes in\nwhich to store all the armaments.\nThe contents of Operation Mayibuye were debated at length again and again\nat Lilliesleaf. The revolutionary enthusiasts\u2014Slovo, Mbeki, Goldreich and\nmilitary figures like Wilton Mkwayi and Joe Gqabi, who had returned from\ntraining in China and had joined the high command\u2014wanted its immediate\nadoption. But others had deep misgivings. \u2018These people were so involved they\nlost all objectivity,\u2019 recalled Kathrada. \u2018They were in a hurry, very impatient to\nget things going. To my mind, it was just impossible.\u2019\nSisulu believed that the plan was \u2018unrealistic\u2019. Bram Fischer subsequently\nreferred to it as \u2018an entirely unrealistic brainchild of some youthful and\nadventurous imagination\u2019. The exact status of Operation Mayibuye was a matter\nof dispute for years to come. Slovo and Mbeki insisted that the document had\nbeen properly approved as official policy. Others denied that. In early June,\nSlovo left South Africa to apprise Oliver Tambo and the ANC\u2019s external mission\nof Operation Mayibuye and to set in motion arrangements for seeking support\nfor it from African governments.\nThe comings and goings at Lilliesleaf Farm were so frequent as to make it\nresemble more a business enterprise than the secret headquarters of a\n\n\frevolutionary movement. Slovo often went there, driving from his office in Innes\nChambers in town, as many as three times a day; so did Fischer, Bernstein and\nother leading conspirators. Living there were not only Goldreich and his family,\nbut at times Sisulu, Kathrada and Mbeki, when they needed temporary quarters.\nGoldberg often drove across from Travallyn. Meetings of the MK high\ncommand and of the central committee of the Communist Party took place there.\nA variety of MK personnel passed through. There were even social events. The\nfarming activities at Lilliesleaf provided some form of cover. But the farm\nworkers themselves were amazed at how careless the conspirators seemed. \u2018You\npeople are asking for prison if you carry on like this,\u2019 the black foreman told\nKathrada. Kathrada raised the security issue over and over again. Bernstein was\nalso worried. \u2018I began to sense that, in the top MK echelons, there was a growing\ngung-ho spirit of recklessness\u2014though in their cloak and dagger operations they\nwould probably have called it necessary boldness. It was not shared by those of\nus who still lived and moved about in fear in the real world outside the fence.\u2019\nThough it was generally agreed that further meetings should take place\nelsewhere, still the conspirators kept coming back to Lilliesleaf and still they\ntook few precautions.\nYet the risks were becoming manifestly greater by the day. A major police\nraid on  June caught several figures who knew the whereabouts of Lilliesleaf.\nThey included Bartholomew Hlapane, a member of the Communist Party central\ncommittee, and Patrick Mthembu, a member of MK\u2019s high command, who had\nbeen part of the first group trained in China and had since become boastful about\nhis exploits. Another supporter arrested at the same time was Brian Somana, a\njournalist friendly with Winnie Mandela who had been one of the drivers used to\ntake her to Lilliesleaf.\nTwo days later the conspirators staged an exercise in bravado with\nconsequences they did not foresee. Using a house in Parktown belonging to\nGoldreich, they erected a radio transmitter to make an \u2018Inaugural Broadcast by\nRadio Liberation\u2019. The taped broadcast was introduced by Mbeki:\nThis is the radio of the African National Congress, calling you from\nunderground in South Africa. Our radio talks to you for the first time today, \nJune, but not for the last time. . . .\nThe government imposed a twenty-four-hour house arrest order on Walter\nSisulu. We could not accept this. . . . Our Congress decided that Walter Sisulu\n\n\fshould leave his home. . . . Today he continues to lead our organization and the\npeople. . . . Here is Walter Sisulu to speak to you from the African National\nCongress underground headquarters.\nA recording from Sisulu followed:\nI speak to you from somewhere in South Africa. I have not left the country. I do\nnot plan to leave. Many of our leaders of the African National Congress have\ngone underground. This is to keep our organization in action; to preserve the\nleadership; to keep the freedom fight going. Never has the country, and our\npeople, needed leadership as they do now, in this hour of crisis. . . .\nWhether anyone other than the conspirators and their friends heard the\nbroadcast was difficult to discover. But a copy of the text was delivered to a\nSouth African news agency in the hope of gaining some publicity. The copy\nquickly found its way into the hands of the security police. They saw it not as an\nirritating stunt but as a breakthrough in their search for the conspirators. Since \nApril the whereabouts of Sisulu had remained a mystery to them. Some believed\nhe had left the country. Sisulu\u2019s broadcast gave them a new target. In\nquestioning detainees in prison, the priority became to locate Sisulu\u2019s base.\n\nAfter spending nearly six months of his five-year sentence in Pretoria Local,\nMandela was suddenly ordered one night in late May  to pack his\nbelongings. Taken to the prison\u2019s reception office, he found three other prisoners\nwaiting there. The prison commander, Colonel Aucamp, told them curtly that\nthey were to be transferred to another prison. When they asked where, he\nreplied, \u2018Die Eiland.\u2019\nThe journey was , miles. The prisoners were shackled together and put\ninto the back of a closed van with a single toilet bucket for use on the way. Not\nuntil they reached Cape Town on the following afternoon were they allowed out\nof the vehicle. At the dockyard, still chained together, they boarded the Robben\nIsland ferry, clambering down a steep, narrow ladder into the hold used to\naccommodate prisoners for the hour-long passage. Mandela caught his first sight\nof the island from the harbour at Murray\u2019s Bay, when he was led back on deck\nas the light was fading. \u2018Green and beautiful, it looked at first more like a resort\nthan a prison,\u2019 he wrote.\nLying six miles north of Green Point and three miles west of Bloubergstrand,\n\n\fguarding the entrance to Table Bay, Robben Island possessed a reputation as a\ndesolate and forbidding place. Roughly oval in shape, less than three miles long\nand one mile wide, it was surrounded by the icy currents of the Atlantic Ocean,\nproviding an effective barrier to escape. In summer months, the view of Table\nMountain to the south, however magnificent, was a constant reminder to\nprisoners of another, different world from which they were barred. In winter,\nnorthwesterly winds drove dark rain clouds across the mountain, obscuring the\nview, and kept the island damp and cold. The flat landscape of the island offered\nlittle protection against these winter winds and winters there were always colder\nthan on the mainland.\nThe history of Robben Island had been marked over three centuries largely by\nmisery and misfortune. Named by Dutch mariners after the thousands of seals\n\u2014robbe\u2014that once lived there, it had been used by successive generations as a\ndumping ground for the miscreants and misfits of society\u2014convicts, political\nprisoners, lepers, lunatics and paupers. Its quarries had provided the mainland\nwith stone and lime since the seventeenth century. In , convicts had built a\nsmall Anglican church there. In , a lighthouse had been constructed on\nMinto\u2019s Hill, the highest point on the island, rising seventy feet above sea level.\nDuring the Second World War, the military had taken possession, installing a\nnew harbour at Murray\u2019s Bay, on the northeastern side of the island, an airstrip\nat its northern end, and gun emplacements, observation towers and residential\nquarters for its garrison of some , people. During the s the island was\nused as a training centre by the South African navy. Then, in , it had been\nhanded over to the prisons department to be used once more as a penal colony\nfor the first time in  years.\nThe prison administration set out deliberately to create an establishment\nfeared for its harsh and brutal regime. Prison life for Africans in South Africa\nwas generally grim, but Robben Island attained special notoriety for its violent\nand vindictive treatment of prisoners. White warders there were given free rein\nto beat and bully inmates into submission. The daily fare they meted out\nincluded assaults, arbitrary punishment and a range of other abuses. Individual\nwarders, like the Kleynhans brothers, became infamous for their cruel and\nsadistic conduct.\nThe first groups of prisoners to be sent to Robben Island were hardened\ncriminals, some of whom were considered to be too dangerous to be kept in\nmaximum-security prisons on the mainland, men accustomed to leading lives of\n\n\fviolence. \u2018Most of the prisoners were disfigured,\u2019 an ANC arrival recorded,\n\u2018their shaven heads covered with scars, their eyes bloodshot, their noses askew,\ntheir teeth knocked out, and their bodies full of tattoos, often obscene.\u2019 The\nconvicts operated in gangs, which warders used to their own advantage,\npatronising some with privileges and employing them to keep others under\ncontrol. Convicts served warders as enforcers and informers. Murders, assaults\nand rapes among prisoners were commonplace. When more general forms of\ndiscipline were needed, warders organised what was called a \u2018carry-on\u2019, during\nwhich they encircled groups of prisoners and continued to beat them with\nbatons, pick-handles and rubber pipes, forcing them to get up once they had\nfallen so that they could be knocked down once more. \u2018After about half an hour\nthe command came to stop,\u2019 an ANC witness said, describing a carry-on. \u2018The\nprisoners staggered away to assemble across the yard and about  formed up\nin front of us. Blood was pouring from their heads; their clothing was torn to\nribbons; their faces were unrecognizable. They were barely able to walk; unable\nto move their arms; moaning; crying.\u2019\nThe first groups of political prisoners sent to Robben Island were PAC\nmembers, many of them arrested as a result of the abortive Poqo uprising in\nApril . Regarded as terrorists and murderers of whites by white warders,\npolitical prisoners were treated with an extra measure of contempt. They were\nmixed in with common-law prisoners. Younger prisoners were often forced to\nbecome \u2018wyfies\u2019 to convicts, with the active encouragement of warders as a\nmeans of humiliation. The small number of ANC members initially imprisoned\non the island had to contend with not only persecution from warders and\nconvicts but open hostility from PAC members, who denounced them as sellouts to whites and communists. Only a handful were there when Mandela\narrived.\nOn the quayside as Mandela disembarked from the ferry stood a group of\nwhite warders shouting taunts that were familiar to all new arrivals, \u2018Dis die\nEiland!\u2019\u2014\u2018This is the Island!\u2019\u2014\u2018Hier julle gaan vrek!\u2019\u2014\u2018Here you will die!\u2019\nThe prisoners were told to line up in pairs and jog along the path to the prison\ncompound as their guards screamed, \u2018Haak! Haak!\u2019, an Afrikaans term used for\ndriving cattle. Determined not to give in to any intimidation, Mandela took the\nlead with Stephen Tefu, a Communist Party trade unionist, signalling that they\nshould walk slowly and deliberately, not run as commanded. A white warder,\none of the Kleynhans brothers, shouted at them, \u2018This is not Johannesburg, this\n\n\fis not Pretoria, this is Robben Island, and we will not tolerate any\ninsubordination here. Haak! Haak!\u2019 Mandela and Tefu continued to walk at a\nleisurely pace. Kleynhans ordered them to halt. \u2018Look, man, we will kill you, we\nare not fooling around, your wives and children and mothers and fathers will\nnever know what happened to you. This is the last warning. Haak! Haak!\u2019\nMandela replied, \u2018You have your duty and we have ours.\u2019\nAt the prison compound, the prisoners were told to strip. Each item of\nclothing was searched and then flung on a wet floor. By the time they put them\nback on, their clothes were soaking. A belligerent prison officer arrived and\nstarted to berate one of the prisoners about the length of his hair. Mandela\nattempted to intervene. The officer cut him off. \u2018Never talk to me that way, boy!\u2019\nhe shouted and advanced threateningly, ready to strike. Though frightened,\nMandela managed to stand his ground: \u2018If you so much as lay a hand on me, I\nwill take you to the highest court in the land and when I finish with you, you will\nbe as poor as a church mouse.\u2019 Mandela was as surprised by his own bravado as\nthe officer was. The officer asked for his ticket. \u2018Five years! You are in for five\nyears and you are so arrogant! Do you know what it means to serve five years?\u2019\nMandela replied, \u2018That is my business. I am ready to serve five years but I am\nnot prepared to be bullied. You must act within the law.\u2019\nAfter this initial confrontation, Mandela settled down to a routine which, by\nRobben Island standards, was relatively benign. He and his three colleagues\nwere given a spacious cell with large windows and its own toilets and showers.\nThe cell, remarked Mandela, was one of the best he had ever seen. Coloured\nwarders stationed on the island at the time were cooperative in supplying them\nwith extra food, tobacco and news. They were kept isolated from all other\nprisoners. But the manual tasks they were given were far less arduous than the\ngruelling work in the quarries other prisoners had to undertake.\nIn July, Mandela was permitted a visit by Winnie, the first time he had seen\nher since starting his prison sentence eight months before. Their meeting took\nplace in a building at the harbour. They were separated by two sections of wire\nmesh, about a yard apart, reaching up to the roof, which prevented them from\nseeing each other properly. There was nowhere for them to sit. To make\nthemselves heard, they had to shout to each other, while white warders stood\nalongside listening to every word, ready to terminate the meeting if they touched\non any forbidden subject. After thirty minutes, their brief encounter was over. \u2018It\nwas horrible,\u2019 Winnie recalled. \u2018I was so depressed when I came away, but at\n\n\fleast I had seen Nelson and he appeared pleased and relieved to see me.\u2019\nMandela\u2019s stay on Robben Island ended as abruptly as it had begun. Later in\nJuly, without warning, he was transferred back to Pretoria Local and held in\nsolitary confinement. He was given no explanation for the move, but from some\nfleeting glimpses he had of other prisoners being held there, he began to discern\nthat something had gone seriously wrong.\n\nThe meeting of conspirators at Lilliesleaf Farm on  July  was intended to\nbe the last time they gathered there for business. The risk of discovery was\nconsidered to be too great. Too many people knew of its existence and some of\nthem were currently in the hands of the security police. Bernstein went there\nonly with the greatest reluctance, persuaded to go \u2018just this once more\u2019. So\nstrong was his sense of foreboding that at the last minute, having at first set out\nfrom his home in Observatory carrying a critique he had written of Operation\nMayibuye, which was due to be discussed that afternoon, he returned home and\nhid it instead in his garage. Others arrived there in disguise. Goldberg brought\nSisulu, Mbeki and Mhlaba from Travallyn in his Volkswagen Combi. Sisulu had\nacquired a lighter complexion, a Chaplinesque moustache and darker hair.\nMbeki wore a blue boiler suit and a balaclava, dressed ostensibly as a farm\nlabourer. Goldberg had grown a beard and moustache. Kathrada, who had been\nstaying overnight at Lilliesleaf preparing a radio broadcast, had dyed his hair\nred, passing himself off as a Portuguese with the name of Pedro Perreira. They\nwere joined by the lawyer Bob Hepple, who came on secretariat business.\nGoldreich was expected to arrive later in the afternoon for the discussion on\nOperation Mayibuye.\nEven though the conspirators acknowledged the extent of the danger at\nLilliesleaf, the old habits of life there died hard. Needing dental treatment, Sisulu\nhad arranged for a white dentist to visit him at Lilliesleaf half an hour before the\nmeeting was due to start at  p.m. The dentist duly came and went.\nThe security police, meanwhile, had begun to move in. The information they\nhad obtained pointed to a house in extensive grounds in the Rivonia area. For\nseveral nights, Lieutenant van Wyk drove up and down tracks and byroads in\nRivonia, taking with him an informer, searching for landmarks. On the third\nnight they identified Lilliesleaf Farm.\n\n\fAt the Grays, a task force for the raid was assembled, led by van Wyk with\nWarrant Officer Dirker as second-in-command. The raid was set for  p.m., but a\nsenior officer recently seconded to the security police, discovering that no search\nwarrant had been issued, ordered van Wyk to obtain one. So the raid had to be\npostponed for two hours, to  p.m.\nAs the conspirators settled down around the table in the thatched cottage at\nLilliesleaf, a dry-cleaning van belonging to a well-known Johannesburg firm\nmoved slowly down the approach road. In front were two men in white\ndustcoats; inside were ten more men and a police Alsatian. A farm employee\nstopped the vehicle, saying there was no one at home. Van Wyk ordered the raid\nto begin.\nThey found Sisulu, Mbeki, Kathrada, Bernstein, Hepple and Mhlaba in the\nthatched cottage. Three of them\u2014Sisulu, Mbeki and Kathrada\u2014tried to escape\nthrough a window but were quickly caught outside. They found Goldberg in the\nmain house. Goldreich was captured when he returned to Lilliesleaf later in the\nday. Subsequently, three more conspirators were arrested: the lawyer Harold\nWolpe; a member of the Johannesburg high command, Andrew Mlangeni; and\nanother communist activist, Elias Motsoaledi.\nThe importance of the Rivonia raid, however, went far beyond the capture of\nleading conspirators. For during their search of the premises at Lilliesleaf and\nlater at Travallyn, the police acquired a massive haul of incriminating documents\nrevealing the full extent of the conspiracy and its international connections. The\nmost significant document was Operation Mayibuye, with its grandiose plans for\nguerrilla warfare, a copy of which had been found hidden in a heating stove\nstanding in a corner of the thatched cottage. But there was a host of other\ndocuments relating to revolutionary methods, arms production, guerrilla\nrecruitment and training, and contacts with China, the Soviet Union and East\nEuropean governments. The Lilliesleaf haul included  maps indicating\ntargets like police stations, post offices, government offices, railway lines,\ntelephone lines and power pylons. At Travallyn, the police also found bombmaking equipment and sketches and diagrams for the production of hand\ngrenades.\nMandela was implicated in all this. More than ten documents were in his\nhandwriting. They included his notes on basic and advanced military training\nand warfare; his diary covering the period from January to June , containing\n\n\fdetails of his tour of Africa, his discussions with Algerian officials and his\nmilitary training course in Ethiopia; and monographs he had copied out on such\nsubjects as \u2018How to be a Good Communist\u2019 and \u2018Dialectical Materialism\u2019. Other\nitems found belonging to Mandela were copies of his press releases and\nstatements, his library of books on warfare, his passport in the name of David\nMotsamayi, and correspondence and photos. Among them were letters from\nWinnie beginning \u2018My dearest love\u2019 and a photograph he liked to keep of her.\nNothing illustrated more the amateurism of Mandela\u2019s revolutionaries than\nthat one year after his arrest on relatively minor charges they should be caught in\na hide-out they knew to be unsafe in possession of useless documents\nimplicating him in offences that could have led to his death by hanging. THE RIVONIA TRIAL\nTHE CONSPIRATORS WERE HELD UNDER THE NINETY-DAY\nDETENTION law, kept in solitary confinement, incommunicado and without\naccess to lawyers. All but two were imprisoned in Pretoria Local. But Arthur\nGoldreich and Harold Wolpe were detained in police cells at Marshall Square in\nJohannesburg and from there they fashioned their escape on  August by\nbribing a young Afrikaner prison guard. Out of sheer vindictiveness, the security\npolice then arrested Wolpe\u2019s law partner and brother-in-law, James Kantor, a\ncriminal lawyer with a reputation as a playboy but with no political connections.\nNo evidence was ever produced implicating Kantor in the conspiracy.\nMeanwhile, the government whipped up a public mood of hysteria and fear.\nMinisters and police officials openly proclaimed the guilt of the detained men,\nthough none of them had yet been charged with any offence. Their arrests were\ndescribed by the commissioner of police as \u2018a major breakthrough in the\nelimination of subversive organizations\u2019. The head of the security police,\nColonel van den Bergh, boasted that the underground was smashed, its leaders\napprehended and that nothing remained to be done other than to mop up the\nremnants. The government was portrayed as being on the verge of victory over\nall its opponents and critics. \u2018It was a time when to be a nonconformist, to act\noffbeat, to speak against the stream, even to think against the stream, was fraught\nwith peril,\u2019 said Joel Joffe, a young lawyer witnessing these events.\nLike an increasing number of young white professional people, Joffe had\nmade plans to emigrate. He had never been politically active, but he had grown\nto dislike life in South Africa, with its suffocating atmosphere of paranoia and\ninjustice. He was on the point of leaving for Australia when he was approached\nby Hilda Bernstein, who had been searching for a lawyer willing to help defend\nher husband in court in the event of charges being laid against him. Mrs\nBernstein had encountered considerable difficulty finding an instructing attorney\nprepared to undertake the task. The hazards for any lawyer acting on behalf of\nthe Rivonia conspirators were severe, both at a professional and at a social level.\n\n\fJoffe was sceptical about what could be achieved. \u2018She was asking that I should\nembark on a case of unknown duration in the defence of people I did not know,\nwhose actions I knew nothing about and on a charge which had not been\nformulated, \u2019 said Joffe. \u2018I felt that even if I were to agree, it would be a waste of\ntime.\u2019 Given all the evidence the government claimed to have, the trial would\nsurely be a mere formality.\nJoffe was nevertheless sufficiently appalled by the manner in which his fellow\nlawyers had shunned Mrs Bernstein\u2014\u2018I really am too busy\u2019\u2014to decide to take\nthe case. Within the next few weeks, he received other approaches: from\nAlbertina Sisulu, from Annie Goldberg, the frail mother of Denis Goldberg, and,\nlater, from Winnie Mandela.\nHe had yet to ascertain what charges were to be brought against the\nconspirators. He went to the Grays to see Colonel George Klindt, the new head\nof the Johannesburg security police, and Dr Percy Yutar, the deputy attorneygeneral of the Transvaal, who had been appointed to take charge of any legal\nproceedings arising from the Rivonia raid and who had set up offices within\nsecurity police headquarters. Neither was helpful. \u2018It was all very smooth, all\npatently false,\u2019 said Joffe. \u2018They were obviously lying and determined to be as\nunhelpful towards me as they possibly could.\u2019\nJoffe also began to assemble a defence team, although there were no funds\navailable to meet their costs. The obvious starting point was Bram Fischer. No\none outside a small group of conspirators knew of Fischer\u2019s real role in the\nunderground. His public reputation was that of a radical lawyer involved in\npolitical cases like the treason trial; he was also known as a skilled advocate\nappearing on behalf of giant mining companies in some of the most abstruse\nfinancial cases in the South African courts. Fischer\u2019s political sympathies were\nevident, but not his involvement in clandestine activity. When Joffe approached\nFischer for his help, he had not the slightest inkling of what he was really asking\nFischer to do. For Fischer the dilemma was only too clear. The evidence\nobtained by police at Lilliesleaf was likely to implicate him; his handwriting was\non several documents seized there. But what was even more hazardous was that\nhe would be called upon to question witnesses in court who could betray him at\nany moment. Fischer did not hesitate to offer his help. He was more than willing\nto assist in the preparation of the case, but, without being able to explain his\nreasons, he said he was reluctant to be part of the defence team at the trial.\n\n\fTwo other advocates agreed to serve on the defence team. One was Mandela\u2019s\nGreek friend George Bizos, by now well versed in political trials. The other was\nArthur Chaskalson, one of the most promising young advocates in the country,\nwho had no political associations but a deep commitment to the defence of\npeople who would otherwise have gone undefended.\nTogether, Joffe, Bizos and Chaskalson put tremendous pressure on Fischer to\nagree to lead the defence team. Not knowing of his involvement in the\nunderground movement, they were unable to understand his reluctance to do so.\nThey insisted that no other advocate could put so well the argument that the\nconspirators had done no more than the Afrikaner rebels who had taken up arms\nagainst the government in  and who had received prison sentences rather\nthan the death penalty. Fischer eventually agreed to lead the defence team and\npersuaded Vernon Berrang\u00e9, then living abroad, to join them. The conspirators,\nhowever, understood full well the risks that Fischer was taking. When Rusty\nBernstein first heard Fischer would be acting on their behalf in the trial, he\nturned to the others and said, \u2018He deserves the Victoria Cross.\u2019\nNearly three months had passed since the conspirators\u2019 arrest and Joffe could\nstill not obtain any information about who the defendants might be and what\ncharges they might face. Then, on  October, without his knowledge, the\nconspirators were taken from their cells, one at a time, to a prison office. There\nthey were formally charged with offences under three acts of which they were\ngiven only the numbers. They were told they would appear in court within fortyeight hours and that they were no longer being held as ninety-day detainees but\nas awaiting-trial prisoners. Mandela was included on the same charges, but he\nwas to remain in the category of a convicted prisoner.\nThe same day, hearing rumours on the legal grapevine that the conspirators\nwere due to appear in court the following morning, Joffe phoned Percy Yutar,\nthe prosecutor, and was told that the prisoners would indeed be appearing then in\nthe Supreme Court in Pretoria. Along with Bizos and Chaskalson, Joffe duly\ntravelled to Pretoria the next day, only to find that no one there knew anything\nabout the case. From the attorney-general, Rudolf Rhein, the lawyers eventually\nascertained that the prisoners would appear in the Supreme Court on the\nfollowing day, but they were still not told who the defendants were or what the\ncharges were, merely that they would find the defendants in Pretoria Local.\nAfter a long wait and various arguments about whether white and black\n\n\fprisoners could mix together, the defendants were eventually produced.\nMandela\u2019s appearance had changed considerably. His large frame had withered;\nhe looked thin and underweight. His face had a sallow complexion, his cheeks\nwere sunken and the skin under his eyes hung in bags. He was dressed in drab\nprison garb: short trousers, a khaki shirt and sandals. But his mood on seeing his\nfellow prisoners was buoyant. For the first time in months, he was able to talk to\nfriends, to touch them, to laugh with them.\nThe sense of reunion was not shared by all the defendants. Of the eleven\nprisoners present, seven of them\u2014Mandela, Sisulu, Mbeki, Kathrada, Mhlaba,\nBernstein and Goldberg\u2014had all played leading roles in the conspiracy. Two\nothers\u2014Elias Motsoaledi and Andrew Mlangeni\u2014had been arrested before the\nRivonia raid and were at a lower level of Umkhonto, but both had been involved\nin sabotage activity; unknown to the police, Mlangeni had been trained in China,\nas had Mhlaba. But for James Kantor, a flamboyant thirty-six-year-old, on\nfriendly terms with police and criminals alike, who counted Colonel Klindt\namong his clients, the abrupt change in his fortunes was hard to bear. He was in\na state of shock, his face haggard and drawn, his extrovert nature crushed. All\nthe accused knew that he had nothing to do with the conspiracy and urged him to\narrange a separate defence.\nThe predicament of the eleventh prisoner, Bob Hepple, was also acute. Hepple\nhad played an active part in the underground movement, but as a secondary\nfigure, passing messages, providing a conduit between the underground and the\noutside world, fixing arrangements. His arrest at Lilliesleaf with the others had\nbeen more a matter of coincidence than an indication of involvement in MK\u2019s\nmilitary plans. In solitary confinement, his police interrogators, flourishing a\ncopy of Operation Mayibuye, had told him he was certain to be sentenced to\ndeath unless he collaborated. \u2018I didn\u2019t want to die for Operation Mayibuye, \u2019 he\nsaid years later. \u2018I was going to be hanged for a plan which I thought was crazy\nand for which I had no responsibility.\u2019 To the dismay and consternation of his\nfellow prisoners, Hepple announced that during his detention he had been\n\u2018asked\u2019, as he put it, to give evidence against the others. He was still considering\nwhat to do, he said. All the excitement of the reunion vanished. As Hepple left\nthe room, the others continued their consultation in a more sombre mood.\nThe following day,  October, the prisoners were driven in a special prison\nvan from Pretoria Local, accompanied by an armed convoy, to the Supreme\nCourt on Church Square, an ornate nineteenth-century building, three storeys\n\n\fhigh, with columns, marble facings and brass rails, known as the Palace of\nJustice. On the other side of Church Square stood the Raadsaal, the seat of the\nold Transvaal Republic government, and, in the centre, a massive bronze statue\nof President Kruger. Armed policemen were everywhere, both outside and inside\nthe Supreme Court.\nFrom the basement cells, Mandela, the first accused, led the procession of\nprisoners up the steps into the courtroom, raising a clenched fist as he emerged.\nThis was the first glimpse of him in public for a year. Dressed in shabby prison\ngarb, short trousers, a khaki shirt and sandals, he had lost so much weight and\nhis skin was so pallid from prison life that to friends in the spectators\u2019 gallery he\nseemed almost unrecognisable. But his smile was still full of its old confidence.\nThe judge assigned to the case was Quartus de Wet, Judge-President of the\nTransvaal, sixty-five years old, a moody, complex character with a reputation for\nbeing self-willed, obstinate and impatient with legal quibbles. He shared the\ncommon white view in the virtues of white supremacy. Yet unlike many other\njudges at the time, he did not owe his position to any allegiance to the National\nParty. He had been appointed to the bench in , before the Nationalists came\nto power.\nPercy Yutar rose to call \u2018the case of the state against the National High\nCommand\u2019, and, for the first time, produced an indictment, handing one copy to\nthe court and passing another to Bram Fischer. The accused were charged under\nthe Sabotage Act and the Suppression of Communism Act with complicity in\nmore than  acts of sabotage aimed at aiding guerrilla warfare and facilitating\nviolent revolution and armed invasion of the country. The Sabotage Act carried\nthe death penalty. In addition to the defendants in court, the indictment listed\ntwenty-four co-conspirators, including Goldreich, Wolpe, Harmel, Slovo,\nHodgson, Kotane and Tambo.\nSignificantly, the accused were not charged under the common law of treason.\nProsecution for treason would have required a preparatory examination, useful to\nthe defence, with two witnesses to every overt act, and proof beyond reasonable\ndoubt. Mindful of the abortive treason trial, Yutar decided to proceed under the\nSabotage Act, which shifted much of the onus of proof from the prosecution to\nthe defence. But his decision was to have a marked influence on the outcome.\nFischer immediately rose to apply for an adjournment, asking for at least six\nweeks to allow the defence time to prepare its case against such grave charges\n\n\fand for the accused to recover from their ordeal of solitary confinement. Yutar\nopposed any postponement. In a high-pitched voice, he spoke of witnesses who\nhad to be called before the end of the month, adding, with a theatrical flourish, \u2018I\nfear for their safety.\u2019 The judge decided that a three-week pause was quite\nsufficient and adjourned the court until  October.\nImmediately after the adjournment, the court reconvened to hear a bail\napplication from Kantor. The case against Kantor was so flimsy that his lawyers\nwere convinced that he should have no difficulty in obtaining bail. After an\neloquent address by his lawyer, Harold Nicholas, the judge turned to Yutar and\nasked simply whether there were any indications that Kantor had been involved\nin the acts of sabotage alleged against the accused. Yutar assured the judge that\nthere was no doubt whatsoever that Kantor was fully involved. He was denied\nbail.\nThe accused and their lawyers were to develop a contempt and hatred for\nYutar that lasted far beyond the trial. A small, bald, dapper fifty-two-year-old\nwho held himself ramrod-erect in court, he had ambitions to become the first\nJewish attorney-general ever appointed in South Africa. He made no secret of\nhis Jewish origins and seemed determined to prove that Jews could be as loyal as\nany other subjects of the apartheid state. He harboured a particular dislike for\nJewish communists, of whom there were a considerable number, and felt no\nqualms about ingratiating himself with the security police. When Joel Joffe,\nhimself a Jew, had met Yutar a few weeks beforehand at security police\nheadquarters, Yutar had made a point of praising his police colleagues. \u2018I have\nbeen at the Grays for three weeks now, and in all that time I have not heard a\nsingle word of anti-Semitism from any of these people,\u2019 he had said. He saw his\nmission as being to present the accused as violent, vicious, self-interested\nindividuals seeking to overthrow the government for their own aggrandisement.\nIn court, when he thought events were going his way, Yutar resorted to open\ngloating; when the tide turned against him his voice rose to a high-pitched\nsqueak. He also had a passion for publicity. On the day before the case began,\nYutar found time to give interviews to reporters and to hand them advance\ncopies of the indictment, which defence counsel had not yet been able to obtain.\nDuring the three-week adjournment, the accused and their lawyers gathered\ndaily to assess the indictment and to work out their line of defence. Restored to\nthe company of his friends and allowed two half-hour visits a week and one meal\na day sent in from outside prison, Mandela\u2019s spirits soon revived. But the\n\n\foutlook for the conspirators was bleak. Mandela was convinced that the trial\nwould result in a death sentence and insisted that they had to prepare themselves\nfor that eventuality. He felt a sense of personal responsibility for what had\nhappened. \u2018He was conscious of obligations over and above others,\u2019 Bernstein\nrecalled. \u2018He had no concern for his own position,\u2019 said Joffe. \u2018His aim was to\nturn the trial into a showcase against the government. \u2019 It was this quality of\nleadership, of standing firm in adversity, of accepting a greater responsibility for\nthe course of events, of maintaining dignity and confidence in the face of a death\nsentence, that was to leave its mark on the Rivonia trial.\nThe accused were determined to use the trial for the purposes not of seeking a\nlesser punishment but of openly proclaiming their political views and the reasons\nwhy they had resorted to violence. They would not deny responsibility for\nsabotage, nor would they attempt to refute evidence obtained by the prosecution\nthat they knew to be true. They would refuse only to provide further information.\nThe matter of a sentence was less important to them than the need to explain in\npublic the stand they had taken.\nObserving the discussions, Joffe noted the influence of Sisulu on Mandela and\nthe others:\nHe was a man of deliberation and slow judgement. At no time during the whole\nof that period did I ever hear Walter make a hasty judgement, or venture an\nappraisal of anybody or anything without first weighing it carefully, deliberately,\ngenerally against his own immediate, instinctive reactions. On every issue, the\nother prisoners gave the greatest weight to Walter\u2019s opinions. It seemed to me\nthroughout the case, neither Nelson nor anyone else made any decision without\nfirst seeking Walter\u2019s opinion. After a short time, we on the defence team found\nourselves behaving the same way.\nThe immediate concern of the lawyers was the indictment. It contained vague\nand general allegations, making it impossible to discern precisely what the\noffence was, by whom the offence had been committed and in what way the\naccused, either individually or jointly, were alleged to be connected with it.\nWhen the lawyers asked the prosecution for further particulars, the replies they\nwere given were curt: either, \u2018These facts are known\u2019 or \u2018These facts are\npeculiarly within the knowledge of the accused.\u2019 The prosecution, said Joffe,\nwas clearly following a simple precept: \u2018You are guilty. Therefore you know\nwhat you did. Therefore we don\u2019t have to tell you.\u2019 The lawyers decided to ask\n\n\fthe court to dismiss the indictment.\nWhen the accused reappeared in court on  October, each in turn emerged\nfrom the stairwell, faced the public gallery, gave the ANC\u2019s clenched-fist salute\nand shouted \u2018Amandla!\u2019 to which their supporters in the gallery replied with a\nloud, \u2018Ngawethu! \u2019 Only Kantor and Hepple did not give the salute, but simply\nsmiled at friends. To prevent further outbursts, the prisoners were subsequently\nbrought into court after the judge had taken his seat and opened the session.\nFischer immediately opened his attack on the indictment, speaking slowly and\ncarefully, weighing up each word, exposing the defects of the indictment one by\none. Some of the sabotage acts, he said, had been committed before any\nSabotage Act existed in South Africa and therefore could not be offences in\nterms of the act under which the accused had been charged. He pointed out that\nMandela had been charged with having committed  acts of sabotage which\nhad taken place while he was in prison. Fischer deplored the lack of particularity\nand the unsatisfactory, even ludicrous answers given when the defence asked for\nfurther particulars. The state, he said, had decided the accused were guilty and\ntherefore the defence was a waste of time. Fischer\u2019s crushing exposure of the\nindictment was followed up with further ridicule from Kantor\u2019s counsellor,\nGeorge Lowen.\nThe judge then turned to Hepple, who was unrepresented, to ask whether he\nwished to say anything about the indictment. But before he had time to reply,\nYutar, sensing that events were moving against him, sprang to his feet to\nannounce that all charges against Hepple were being withdrawn, adding, in a\nvoice of triumph, that Hepple would be the first witness for the prosecution\nagainst the accused. Hepple turned pale, rose to his feet and was accompanied\nfrom the dock by Captain Swanepoel down the stairwell to the cells below.\nHepple\u2019s defection was a considerable coup for Yutar. His fellow prisoners\nhad been expecting it; Hepple had discussed with them the possibility of\ninducing Yutar to release him and then skipping the country. However, to the\npublic, it seemed that Yutar had gained a star witness. But he was still left with\nan indictment virtually in tatters after Fischer and Lowen had finished with it.\nIgnoring the legal arguments presented by the defence team, Yutar asserted that\ntheir application was neither genuine nor sincere, but merely an attempt to harass\nand embarrass the state. With increasing desperation, he resorted to \u2018begging\u2019\nand \u2018imploring\u2019 the court not to reject the indictment, promising to provide\n\n\fwhatever further particulars the judge wanted. De Wet replied testily that it was\nnot his responsibility to tell the state what particulars were required to make a\ngood indictment. Yutar continued, \u2018I would earnestly beg Your Lordship, nay\ncrave Your Lordship, not to squash the indictment, but to order that the state\ndoes what it undertakes to do, that is to supply further particulars.\u2019\nIt was all to no avail. De Wet threw out the indictment. Technically the\nprisoners were free men. Their friends and relatives and the security police\nrushed forward. Amid pandemonium, Swanepoel leapt into the dock and struck\neach of the accused on the shoulder, declaring, \u2018I am arresting you on a charge\nof sabotage.\u2019 Within a few minutes, the prisoners were herded down to the cells\nagain.\nOn the same day, bail applications were due to be heard first for Kantor and\nthen for Bernstein. The judge appeared sympathetic to Kantor\u2019s case and at one\nstage asked his defence counsel what he considered would be a reasonable sum\nfor bail. The discussion was nearly at an end when Yutar suddenly intervened to\nannounce that he was in possession of a confidential secret document showing\nthat escape plans had been made for the accused. What had prompted Yutar\u2019s\nlatest claim was the discovery among the Rivonia documents of the escape notes\nwhich Mandela had exchanged with Slovo in  and which Slovo had decided\nto preserve for posterity. Kantor\u2019s application was rejected; so was Bernstein\u2019s.\nBack at Pretoria Local, the accused continued with the preparation of their\ndefence in a consulting room on the ground floor specially set aside for them.\nAssuming that the room was bugged and that everything they said was overheard\nby the security police, they communicated with each other by using a simple\ncoded language or by writing down messages and then burning them in ashtrays\nbefore their daily sessions were over. Prison warders watched this procedure\nthrough a door window with some distress. Before long, Captain Swanepoel was\nseen pacing up and down the corridor, glancing through the window whenever\nhe passed. The prisoners realised how badly Swanepoel wanted to get his hands\non their messages and laid a trap for him. On a piece of paper Mbeki wrote, \u2018It\u2019s\nso nice to have Lieutenant Swanepoel with us again\u2019, waited for Swanepoel to\npass by and then passed it ostentatiously to Joffe. Joffe studied the message for\nsome time, whispered in a conspiratorial manner to the prisoners and then,\nplacing the message in an ashtray, fumbled for his matches. Swanepoel dashed\ninto the room, seized the ashtray with the message in it and rushed outside. He\ndid not appear outside the door again.\n\n\fA new indictment was eventually produced. But it was still so badly flawed\nthat the defence lawyers decided to apply again for its dismissal. This time,\nhowever, de Wet was in no mood to countenance further delay and he ordered\nthe case to proceed.\nBut now yet another drama intervened. Yutar\u2019s first witness, Bob Hepple, had\nmanaged to flee the country and he surfaced in Dar es Salaam, the Tanganyikan\ncapital, stating that he had no intention of testifying against the accused, whom\nhe admired and supported. He spoke of threats and broken promises made by the\npolice, and revealed the mental and physical torture to which detainees under the\nninety-day law were subjected. What no one knew at the time was that his\nescape had been arranged by Bram Fischer, who had met him in secret on three\noccasions at huge potential risk to himself.\nThe trial eventually began on  December . The accused were asked by\nthe registrar of the court to plead.\nMANDELA: The government should be in the dock, not me. I plead not\nguilty.\nHis remark caused some consternation. There was angry muttering among the\npolice.\nSISULU: It is the government which is guilty, not me.\nDE WET: I don\u2019t want any political speeches here. You may plead\nguilty, or not guilty. But nothing else.\nSISULU: It is the government which is responsible for what is\nhappening. I plead not guilty.\nGOLDBERG: I associate myself with the statements of Mr Mandela and\nMr Sisulu. I plead not guilty.\nAnd so it went on, except for Kantor, who said simply, \u2018I am not guilty, My\nLord.\u2019\nThen Yutar rose to give his opening address. He had spent con - siderable\neffort on it. He had also decided to arrange for it to be recorded by the statecontrolled radio network; a small black microphone had appeared overnight in\nfront of his desk. Broadcasting court proceedings was unprecedented in South\nAfrican history. No attempt had been made to consult defence counsel on the\nmatter. No sooner was Yutar on his feet than Fischer rose to demand the removal\n\n\fof the microphones. De Wet looked uncomfortable but ordered them to be\ndismantled.\nThe \u2018cornerstone\u2019 of the state\u2019s case was Operation Mayibuye, said Yutar.\n\u2018The accused deliberately and maliciously plotted and engineered the\ncommission of acts of violence and destruction throughout the country.\u2019\nThe planned purpose . . . was to bring about in the Republic of South\nAfrica chaos, disorder and turmoil which would be aggravated, according\nto their plan, by the operation of thousands of trained guerrilla warfare\nunits deployed throughout the country at various vantage points. These\nwould be joined in various areas by local inhabitants as well as specially\nselected men posted to such areas. Their combined operations were\nplanned to lead to confusion, violent insurrection and rebellion, followed\nat the appropriate juncture by armed invasion of the country by military\nunits of foreign powers. In the midst of the resulting chaos, turmoil and\ndisorder it was planned by the accused to set up a provisional\nrevolutionary government to take over the administration and control of\nthis country.\nYutar went on to give details of the Rivonia headquarters, the arsenal at\nTravallyn and the plans for training in sabotage and guerrilla warfare in African\nstates. Documents and witnesses would be produced, he said, to substantiate all\nthis.\nThe extent of the conspiracy, as Yutar outlined it, left the defence lawyers\nfeeling considerably shaken. \u2018From that moment on, we saw the case in a very\nsimple light,\u2019 said Joffe. \u2018For most of the accused the only possible verdict was\n\u201cguilty\u201d. The case was therefore, as far as we were concerned, a battle to prevent\nthe death sentence being carried out.\u2019\nDuring the next three months, the prosecution presented  witnesses,\nhundreds of documents, photographs and maps and a whole library of captured\nbooks on guerrilla warfare. All Mandela\u2019s papers found at Lilliesleaf were\nproduced. \u2018Nelson felt that he had been let down by that,\u2019 Sisulu recalled.\nMandela had once asked Sisulu during a chance meeting in Pretoria Local in\n to ensure that his documents were removed from Lilliesleaf. Sisulu had\nraised the matter with Mbeki, but nothing had been done: \u2018Nelson felt that the\nfact that he was linked to the whole business was because we were responsible\nfor not taking appropriate steps.\u2019\n\n\fBut prosecution witnesses also inflicted damage. The state\u2019s key witness was\nBruno Mtolo, a member of MK\u2019s Natal regional command, an active saboteur\nfor three years whom Mandela had met on his journey to Durban in August \nand who had also visited the Rivonia headquarters in , where he had held\ndiscussions with Sisulu and Mbeki. Arrested by the security police in August\n, Mtolo had decided within hours to defect, claiming he had become\ndisillusioned with MK\u2019s leadership and with the extent of communist influence\nover the ANC, even though he himself was a Communist Party member. Mtolo\nimplicated not only Mandela, Sisulu and Mbeki but a host of other people in MK\nactivities.\nAnother key witness was Patrick Mthembu, a member of the Johannesburg\nregional command, who had trained in China and had worked closely with all\nthe conspirators, both during the days when the ANC was a legal organisation\nand during Umkhonto operations. Mthembu had spent two periods in solitary\nconfinement. He was offered indemnity against prosecution in exchange for his\ntestimony.\nJust before the Christmas recess, Kantor was finally granted bail. Over the\nmonths of the trial he had developed a warm relationship with Mandela.\nKnowing of Kantor\u2019s anguish at being separated from his wife, Barbara, who\nwas pregnant, Mandela had once come over to him and put his arm around his\nshoulder. \u2018Tell Barbara I apologize,\u2019 said Mandela. \u2018What for?\u2019 asked Kantor.\n\u2018Because you are here,\u2019 he answered simply.\nIn January , while sitting in the dock, Kantor wrote a note for Mandela,\nwhich was passed along the row of accused. It said, \u2018Barbara and I have thought\nabout and discussed godfathers at length. We have come to the conclusion that,\nwhether the baby is a girl or boy, we would consider it an honour if you would\nagree to accept this office as an adjunct to the more disreputable positions you\nhave held in the past.\u2019 Mandela\u2019s reply took some time to arrive, reaching\nKantor just before the tea adjournment: \u2018I would be more than delighted, and the\nhonour is mine, not the baby\u2019s.\u2019 As the court rose for the tea break, Mandela\nhung back as the other accused left, pretending to arrange his papers, and\nexchanged a quick word with Kantor. \u2018Now they dare not hang me,\u2019 he said,\nbeaming broadly.\nIn April , soon after the prosecution concluded its case, Judge de Wet\nfound Kantor not guilty and discharged him. He left the court wearing the tie\n\n\fMandela had offered him in exchange for his own as a token of good luck before\nthe hearing started.\nDuring the five-week adjournment allowed to the defence to examine the\nevidence and prepare their case, the prison authorities at Pretoria Local provided\na new consultation room for the conspirators and their lawyers. It was long and\nnarrow and down the middle of it the prison building staff had constructed a\nwooden counter topped by a heavy metal grating, dividing the room in half. Bar\nstools had been placed on either side, one side for the lawyers, the other for the\nconspirators. When the lawyers were first ushered into the new consultation\nroom, the prisoners were already seated on their side of the partition, lined up in\na long row like customers at a milk bar. Mandela stood up, smiled politely and\nsaid, \u2018What will it be today, gentle - men? Chocolate or ice-cream soda?\u2019 The\nprison commander, Colonel Aucamp, a malevolent official with whom Mandela\nhad previously clashed, was not amused. The lawyers protested that the\narrangements, with nine accused in a single line along the counter on one side\nand five lawyers sitting on bar stools on the other, made a proper consultation\nvirtually impossible. Exhibits and notes had to be slid through a tiny space under\nthe metal bars. But Colonel Aucamp refused to allow any changes. To add to\ntheir difficulties, the lawyers and their clients now had to assume that the new\ncontraption contained listening devices relaying everything that was said to\nofficials outside. They resorted again to passing notes on any issue considered\nimportant.\nThe conspirators were clear about their objective in the trial. They wanted an\nopportunity to explain to the world their reasons for embarking on a campaign of\nviolence against the government and the circumstances which had forced them\nto do so. They would admit to initiating the sabotage campaign; they would\nadmit to making contingency plans for guerrilla warfare to be implemented if the\nsabotage campaign failed to change the government\u2019s mind; but they would\ndeny that they had already decided to embark on guerrilla warfare, as the\nprosecution contended. They therefore needed to clarify the circumstances under\nwhich Operation Mayibuye was drawn up. They also wanted to make clear that\nthe sabotage campaign had been carried out with express instructions that under\nno circumstances should human life be endangered at any time. They would\ntherefore contest prosecution claims of murder and injury. They would also deny\nthat the intervention of foreign forces had been contemplated, as Yutar had\nfurther claimed.\n\n\fThe case against individual conspirators, however, was not of equal strength.\nThe evidence against Bernstein was negligible; he had merely been discovered at\nLilliesleaf with the others. The evidence against Kathrada and Mhlaba was also\nlimited. The evidence against Mlangeni and Motsoaledi showed mainly that they\nhad been involved in the recruitment and transportation of volunteers for\nmilitary training abroad, making them lower-level operatives in the conspiracy.\nGoldberg was identified as a sabotage expert involved in preparations for\narmaments manufacture. Only Mandela, Sisulu and Mbeki were fully implicated\nas leading figures in the conspiracy. The solution agreed upon, therefore, was\nthat six of the conspirators would make admissions of guilt on certain charges.\nThe remaining three\u2014Bernstein, Kathrada and Mhlaba\u2014would continue to\nplead not guilty.\nIn order to ensure that the court heard a clear and coherent account of their\npolitical aims and ideals, the accused decided that Mandela should open the case\nfor the defence by reading a statement from the dock, unhindered by crossexamination or questions from the bench. This procedure also enabled Mandela\nto avoid any suggestion that he was retracting from the position he had taken at\nhis previous trial in  of refusing to enter the witness box because of the\ninherent injustice of the legal system. The disadvantage for Mandela was that a\nstatement from the dock was not accorded the same legal weight as ordinary\ntestimony and thus rendered him more vulnerable before the court. But Mandela\nregarded whatever sentence he received as being of secondary importance to the\nneed for public understanding of the conspirators\u2019 beliefs.\nMandela spent about two weeks drafting his speech, working mainly in his\ncell in the evenings. He showed the draft to his fellow prisoners, who suggested\na few changes, and to Bram Fischer. Fischer was worried about the content,\nabout the damage it would do to Mandela\u2019s prospects in court, and took it to a\nhighly respected advocate, Harold Hanson, for his opinion. Hanson told Fischer,\n\u2018If Mandela reads this in court they will take him straight out to the back of the\ncourthouse and string him up.\u2019 Fischer urged Mandela to modify the speech, but\nto no avail. \u2018I felt we were likely to hang no matter what we said, so we might as\nwell say what we truly believed,\u2019 said Mandela. \u2018Bram begged me not to read\nthe final paragraph, but I was adamant.\u2019\nOn  April , the conspirators were taken back to the Palace of Justice to\ncommence their defence. Both Winnie and Mandela\u2019s mother were present in\ncourt. In his opening remarks, made in his customary quiet and calm manner,\n\n\fFischer announced that certain aspects of the state\u2019s evidence would be\nconceded by the accused, but other parts would be challenged. They would deny\nthat Umkhonto was a section of the ANC\u2014\u2018the military wing\u2019, as the state\nclaimed\u2014but seek to show that the leaders of Umkhonto and the ANC\nendeavoured to keep these two organisations entirely distinct. \u2018They did not\nalways succeed in this,\u2019 he said, \u2018but . . . every effort was made to achieve that\nobject.\u2019 They would also deny emphatically that the ANC was a \u2018tool\u2019 of the\nCommunist Party, as the state claimed, and that the aims and objectives of the\nANC were the aims and objectives of the Communist Party. They would further\ndeny that Umkhonto had adopted Operation Mayibuye and had decided upon\nguerrilla warfare.\nDE WET: Will that be denied?\nFISCHER: That will be denied. Here the evidence will show that while\npreparations for guerrilla warfare were being made from as early as ,\nno plan was ever adopted, and the evidence will show why it was hoped\nthroughout such a step could be avoided.\nFischer paused, while the judge finished making notes, and then announced\nthat Mandela would make a statement from the dock. Yutar was caught by\nsurprise. He had been misled into believing that he would have the benefit of\ncross-examining Mandela. As Mandela rose slowly, adjusting the spectacles\nwhich he used for reading, Yutar jumped to his feet, his shrill voice rising in\ncomplaint.\nYUTAR: My Lord! My Lord! I think you should warn the accused that\nwhat he says from the dock has far less weight than if he submitted\nhimself to cross-examination!\nDE WET: I think, Mr Yutar, that counsel for the defence have sufficient\nexperience to be able to advise their clients without your assistance.\nStanding in the dock, Mandela began reading his statement slowly and with\ncalm deliberation, his voice carrying clearly across the courtroom. Gradually, as\nhe spoke, the silence in the courtroom became more profound.\nI must deal immediately and at some length with the question of\nviolence. Some of the things so far told to the court are true and some are\nuntrue. I do not, however, deny that I planned sabotage. I did not plan it\nin a spirit of recklessness, nor because I have any love of violence. I\n\n\fplanned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political\nsituation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, exploitation and\noppression of my people by the whites.\nI admit immediately that I was one of the persons who helped to form\nUmkhonto we Sizwe, and that I played a prominent role in its affairs\nuntil I was arrested in August .\nHe went on to explain the reasons behind the formation of Umkhonto:\nFirstly, we believed that as a result of government policy, violence by the\nAfrican people had become inevitable and that unless responsible leadership was\ngiven to canalize and control the feelings of our people, there would be\noutbreaks of terrorism which would produce an intensity of bitterness and\nhostility between the various races of this country which is not produced even by\nwar.\nSecondly, we felt that without violence there would be no way open to the\nAfrican people to succeed in their struggle against the principle of white\nsupremacy. All lawful modes of expressing opposition to this principle had been\nclosed by legislation, and we were placed in a position in which we had either to\naccept a permanent state of inferiority or to defy the government. We chose to\ndefy the law. We first broke the law in a way which avoided any recourse to\nviolence; when this form was legislated against, and then the government\nresorted to a show of force to crush opposition to its policies, only then did we\ndecide to answer violence with violence.\nBut the violence which we chose to adopt was not terrorism. We who formed\nUmkhonto were all members of the African National Congress and had behind\nus the ANC tradition of non-violence and negotiation as a means of solving\npolitical disputes. We believed that South Africa belonged to all the people who\nlived in it, and not to one group, be it black or white. We did not want an\ninterracial war and tried to avoid it to the last minute.\nMandela referred to the time in mid- when the decision to turn to\nviolence was taken.\nFor a long time the people had been talking of violence\u2014of the day\nwhen they would fight the white man and win back their country\u2014and\nwe, the leaders of the ANC, had nevertheless always prevailed upon\nthem to avoid violence and to pursue peaceful methods. When some of\n\n\fus discussed this in May and June of , it could not be denied that our\npolicy to achieve a non-racial state by non-violence had achieved\nnothing, and that our followers were beginning to lose confidence in this\npolicy and were developing disturbing ideas of terrorism. . . .\nAfter a long and anxious assessment of the South African situation, I,\nand some colleagues, came to the conclusion that as violence in this\ncountry was inevitable, it would be unrealistic and wrong for African\nleaders to continue preaching peace and non-violence at a time when the\ngovernment met our peaceful demands with force.\nThis conclusion was not easily arrived at. It was only when all else had\nfailed, when all channels of peaceful protest had been barred to us, that\nthe decision was made to embark on violent forms of political struggle,\nand to form Umkhonto we Sizwe. We did so not because we desired such\na course, but solely because the government had left us with no other\nchoice.\nHe outlined what he thought could be achieved by the use of violence.\nThe initial plan was based on a careful analysis of the political and\neconomic situation of our country. We believed that South Africa\ndepended to a large extent on foreign capital and foreign trade. We felt\nthat planned destruction of power plants and interference with rail and\ntelephone communications would tend to scare away capital from the\ncountry, make it more difficult for goods from the industrial areas to\nreach the seaports on schedule and would in the long run be a heavy\ndrain on the economic life of the country, thus compelling the voters of\nthe country to reconsider their position.\nAttacks on the economic lifelines of the country were to be linked with\nsabotage on government buildings and other symbols of apart - heid.\nThese attacks would serve as a source of inspiration to our people. In\naddition, they would provide an outlet for those people who were urging\nthe adoption of violent methods and would enable us to give concrete\nproof to our followers that we had adopted a stronger line and were\nfighting back against government violence.\nIn addition, if mass action were successfully organized, and mass\nreprisals taken, we felt that sympathy for our cause would be roused in\nother countries and that greater pressure would be brought to bear on the\n\n\fSouth African government.\nHe dealt with the relationship between the ANC and Umkhonto. The ANC, he\nsaid, was a political organisation with a political function to fulfil. Its members\nhad joined on the express policy of non - violence. It could not undertake\nviolence without a change in the whole nature of the organisation. Nevertheless,\nit had been prepared to depart from its fifty-year-old policy of non-violence to\nthe extent that it would no longer disapprove of \u2018properly controlled violence\u2019.\nUmkhonto remained a small organisation, recruiting its members from different\nraces and organisations and trying to achieve its own particular objective of\nsabotage. Although there had been some \u2018overlapping of functions\u2019 and although\nthe distinction between the two may have become \u2018blurred\u2019, the distinction was\nstill clear: \u2018The fact that members of Umkhonto were recruited from the ANC,\nand the fact that persons served both organizations . . . did not, in our view,\nchange the nature of the ANC or give it a policy of violence.\u2019\nHe also dealt with the relationship between the ANC and the Communist\nParty: \u2018It is true that there has often been close cooperation between the ANC\nand the Communist Party. But cooperation is merely proof of a common goal\u2014\nin this case the removal of white supremacy\u2014and is not proof of a complete\ncommunity of interests.\u2019 The ANC, unlike the Communist Party, admitted only\nAfricans as members. Its chief goal was for the African people to win unity and\nfull political rights. The Communist Party\u2019s main aim, on the other hand, was to\nremove the capitalists and to replace them with a working-class government. The\nCommunist Party sought to emphasise class distinctions, while the ANC sought\nto harmonise them. The ANC had never at any period of its history advocated a\nrevolutionary change in the economic structure of the country, nor had it ever\ncondemned capitalist society.\nHe turned to his own political allegiances. He described himself as \u2018an\nAfrican patriot\u2019, a socialist influenced by Marxist thought, but not a communist.\nHe was attracted by the idea of a classless society, partly as a result of his\nreading of Marxist literature, partly as a result of his admiration for early African\nsocieties in which the land, then the main means of production, belonged to the\ntribe. But there were aspects of Marxist thinking with which he fundamentally\ndisagreed:\nFrom my reading of Marxist literature and from conversations with Marxists, I\nhave gained the impression that communists regard the parliamentary system of\n\n\fthe West as undemocratic and reactionary. But, on the contrary, I am an admirer\nof such a system.\nThe Magna Carta, the Petition of Rights and the Bill of Rights are documents\nwhich are held in veneration by democrats throughout the world.\nI have great respect for British political institutions and for the country\u2019s\nsystem of justice. I regard the British parliament as the most democratic\ninstitution in the world, and the independence and impartiality of its judiciary\nnever fail to arouse my admiration.\nThe American Congress, that country\u2019s doctrine of separation of powers, as\nwell as the independence of its judiciary, arouses in me similar sentiments.\nI have been influenced in my thinking by both West and East. All this has led\nme to feel that in my search for a political formula, I should be absolutely\nimpartial and objective. I should tie myself to no particular system of society\nother than that of socialism. I must leave myself free to borrow the best from the\nWest and from the East.\nHe went on to outline the conditions in which the African population lived\nand worked, comparing them to the affluent lifestyle of the white population.\nAfricans were fighting against two features that were the hallmark of African\nlife: poverty and lack of human dignity.\nAfricans want a just share in the whole of South Africa, they want a\nsecurity and a stake in society.\nAbove all, we want equal political rights, because without them our\ndisabilities will be permanent. I know this sounds revolutionary to the\nwhites in this country, because the majority of voters will be Africans.\nThis makes the white man fear democracy.\nBut this fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the only solution\nwhich will guarantee racial harmony and freedom for all. It is not true\nthat the enfranchisement of all will result in racial domination. Political\ndivision, based on colour, is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so\nwill the domination of one colour group by another. The ANC has spent\nhalf a century fighting against racialism. When it triumphs it will not\nchange that policy.\nThis then is what the ANC is fighting. Their struggle is a truly national\n\n\fone. It is a struggle of the African people, inspired by their own suffering\nand their own experience. It is a struggle for the right to live.\nMandela stopped reading his statement at this point, put down his papers and\nturned to face the judge, speaking his final words from memory:\nDuring my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African\npeople. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black\ndomination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which\nall persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal\nwhich I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I\nam prepared to die.\nIn the courtroom there was complete silence as Mandela sat down. For\nperhaps thirty seconds the silence continued. Then from the public gallery there\ncame a great sigh, like the release of breath, and the crying of women.\n\nMandela\u2019s statement, lasting more than four hours, was followed by the\nevidence of Walter Sisulu. Sisulu was the key witness for the defence, his\nknowledge of the ANC and of Umkhonto being greater than anyone else\u2019s. Upon\nhim lay the burden of convincing the judge that Operation Mayibuye had been\nconsidered as a plan of action but not adopted as a policy, the issue which the\ndefence lawyers considered was the \u2018hairline\u2019 around which the prospect of a\ndeath sentence revolved. As Fischer led him through his evidence, Sisulu\nexplained how he had been present when Operation Mayibuye had first been\nplaced before the high command as a plan for consideration. The implications of\nlaunching guerrilla warfare were so far-reaching that the high command had\nsought the views of the ANC and other organisations. Among members of the\nhigh command itself, opinion was deeply divided. \u2018There was a strong argument\nagainst the plan,\u2019 said Sisulu. Several meetings were held to discuss it further.\nThe last meeting had adjourned without taking a decision. \u2018My view was that\nconditions did not exist at that time for Operation Mayibuye.\u2019\nSisulu was subjected to five days of cross-examination, withstanding a\nbarrage of questions, gibes and taunts from Yutar. \u2018It was a feat of considerable\nmerit, and under extremely difficult conditions,\u2019 remarked Joffe. \u2018For over a\nweek, Sisulu was kept in complete isolation with no human contact at all, day\nafter day in the witness box being hammered by judge and prosecutor.\u2019 One by\n\n\fone, the other accused\u2014Kathrada, Mhlaba, Bernstein, Mbeki and Goldberg\u2014\ntook their turn in the witness box to face the same treatment. Motsoaledi and\nMlangeni made short statements from the dock, admitting their guilt as minor\nparticipants in Umkhonto. Motsoaledi described how he had been assaulted\nduring his period in solitary confinement and how his wife, the mother of seven\nchildren, had been detained under the ninety-day law and rearrested when she\nhad completed ninety days. Mlangeni described how he had been assaulted and\ntortured with electric shocks in police custody.\nOn  May, Yutar arrived in court carrying four volumes containing a\nsummary of evidence which he proceeded to read out as his closing argument.\nMuch of it amounted to a political attack on the accused. \u2018The deceit of the\naccused is amazing,\u2019 he said. \u2018Although they represented scarcely more than \nper cent of the African population [a reference to the ANC\u2019s membership] they\ntook it upon themselves to tell the world that the Africans in South Africa are\nsuppressed, oppressed and depressed.\u2019 He repeated his assertion that not only\nhad guerrilla warfare been agreed upon but that a date had actually been set.\nThen de Wet intervened. \u2018Mr Yutar,\u2019 he said, \u2018you do concede that you failed\nto prove guerrilla warfare was ever decided upon, do you not?\u2019\nYutar looked stunned and stammered a submission that preparations were\nbeing made.\nDe Wet replied testily, \u2018Yes, I know that. The defence concedes that. What\nthey say is that preparations were made in case one day they found it necessary\nto resort to guerrilla warfare. But they say that prior to their arrest they never\nconsidered it necessary, and took no decision to engage in guerrilla warfare. I\ntake it that you have no evidence contradicting that, and that you accept it?\u2019\n\u2018As Your Lordship pleases,\u2019 Yutar replied, in a strangled voice. He then\nconcluded by arguing that the case was one of not only high treason par\nexcellence but murder and attempted murder, even though no such charges had\nbeen made against the accused.\nArthur Chaskalson rose to refute that the trial had anything to do with murder\nor attempted murder. He proceeded to demonstrate from the testimony of state\nwitnesses, like Mtolo, that Umkhonto\u2019s clear policy was sabotage in\ncircumstances where life was not endangered. The indictment, he pointed out,\nalleged military training and sabotage. The defence conceded, he said, that\nUmkhonto recruited men for military training and that members of Umkhonto\n\n\fcommitted acts of sabotage. The defence denied, however, that they committed\nall the acts of sabotage they were charged with.\nAs he began to demonstrate from evidence that there were other organisations\ncommitting acts of sabotage at the time, de Wet intervened to say that he already\naccepted this as a fact. In one stroke, a major part of the state\u2019s case\u2014that\nUmkhonto had been responsible for all acts of sabotage\u2014fell away.\nFischer then rose to deal with the two most serious contentions: first, that the\nhigh command had decided to embark on guerrilla warfare; and second, that\nUmkhonto was the military wing of the ANC\u2014acceptance of which could have\nmade every member of the ANC liable to prosecution for sabotage or treason.\nFischer had spent months preparing his submissions on these points, but before\nhe could develop his argument on the first issue de Wet cut him short, saying, \u2018I\nthought I had made my attitude clear. I accept no decision or date was fixed\nupon for guerrilla warfare.\u2019 When Fischer moved on to the second issue, de Wet\nagain intervened, saying he accepted that though the two organisations\noverlapped, they were in fact separate.\nAll that remained to be determined were the verdict and the sentence. In the\ncase of six accused\u2014Mandela, Sisulu, Mbeki, Goldberg, Motsoaledi, and\nMlangeni\u2014they had already admitted guilt. The fates of Bernstein, Kathrada and\nMhlaba were less certain. But the centre of interest, as it had been throughout the\ntrial, was on whether or not the conspirators would receive the death penalty.\nDuring the three-week adjournment before the sentence was announced,\nMandela settled down to write a London University law examination, which he\nwas to pass.\nAs the Rivonia trial reached its climax, the outcome stirred intense interest\ninternationally. Mandela\u2019s defiant statement of his beliefs, his testimony\ndeclaring his willingness to die for the cause of democracy in South Africa and\nhis bearing before the court had captured worldwide attention. Demonstrations\nwere held in Europe and the United States. Students at the University of London\nelected Mandela as president of the student\u2019s union midway through the trial. On\n June, two days before the judge was due to give his decision, the United\nNations Security Council urged the South African government to end the trial\nand to grant an amnesty to the defendants and to all others who had been\nrestricted or imprisoned for opposing apartheid; Britain and the United States\nabstained on the vote. In London, an all-night vigil was held at St Paul\u2019s\n\n\fCathedral.\nIt took Judge de Wet three minutes on  June  to find all the\nconspirators except Bernstein guilty. He reserved sentence for the following day.\nBernstein was immediately surrounded by security police, arrested as he tried to\nreach the defence counsel\u2019s table, hustled down to the cells with the others and\ncharged with new offences.\nThat evening, the defence lawyers called at Pretoria Local to confer with the\nprisoners. The lawyers were pessimistic about the sentence they thought likely.\nRecent sentences imposed by South African courts had established some harsh\nprecedents. An eighteen-year-old youth had been sent to prison for ten years for\nattempting to leave the country in order to be trained by the ANC as a motor\nmechanic. Another ANC supporter had received twenty years\u2019 hard labour for\nrecruiting a man for military training abroad. Several young men had been\nsentenced to ten years for attending a single meeting at which sabotage was\ndiscussed, even though there was no evidence that the accused had done any\nmore than listen to the discussion.\nYet the lawyers found the prisoners as resolute as ever. Joel Joffe recalled:\nThey were calm, living now in the shadow of death. The strain and the tension\nwere becoming almost unbearable, yet the only matter that they wanted to\ndiscuss was how they should behave in court if the death sentence was passed.\nWe told them that the judge would ask the first accused, Nelson Mandela,\n\u2018Have you any reason to advance why the death sentence should not be passed?\u2019\nNelson decided that he would have a lot to say. He would tell the court that if\nthey thought by sentencing him to death they would destroy the liberation\nmovement they were wrong; he was prepared to die for his beliefs and knew that\nhis death would be an inspiration to his people.\nWe pointed out that such an address was hardly designed to facilitate an\nappeal. Nelson\u2019s answer was simple. If sentenced to death he would not appeal.\nMandela, Sisulu and Mbeki had already decided among themselves not to\nappeal. They believed that an appeal would undermine the moral stand they had\ntaken. It might be interpreted by their supporters as an act of weakness. \u2018Our\nmessage was that no sacrifice was too great in the struggle for freedom,\u2019 said\nMandela.\nThat night, after the lawyers had left, dismayed at their decision and hoping\n\n\fthey would change their minds, Mandela scribbled a few lines which he intended\nto use if he were sentenced to death. \u2018I meant everything I said,\u2019 he wrote.\n\u2018I was prepared for the death penalty,\u2019 Mandela said in his autobiography. \u2018To\nbe truly prepared for something, one must actually expect it. One cannot be\nprepared for something while secretly believing it will not happen. We were all\nprepared, not because we were brave but because we were realistic.\u2019\nThe following morning, outside the Palace of Justice, a large crowd gathered\nsilently, some carrying banners declaring, \u2018We are proud of our leaders.\u2019 Inside,\nthe courtroom was packed. Winnie and Mandela\u2019s mother were once again\npresent.\nBefore sentence was passed, the court heard two pleas in mitigation. The\ndefendants were at first reluctant to allow anyone to speak on their behalf but\nthen agreed on condition that nothing was said that could be construed as an\napology. A number of names were suggested, but most of those approached\ndeclined to undertake the task. Bram Fischer finally gained the assistance of two\ndistinguished South Africans: Harold Hanson, a highly respected advocate, and\nAlan Paton, the writer. As leader of the Liberal Party, a devout believer in non violence and a known anti-communist, Paton had often been critical of the\naccused, but when approached for his help Paton asked one simple question:\n\u2018Are their lives in danger?\u2019 On being told yes, Paton said, \u2018In that case, there is\nno question at all. I will give evidence if I am called.\u2019 Joel Joffe remarked later,\n\u2018He was almost the last of a breed that had become nearly extinct in South\nAfrica\u2014the liberal of principle and courage, who is not afraid to raise his voice\nagainst the stream.\u2019\nPaton spoke of Mandela, Sisulu and Mbeki as \u2018men well known for their\ncourage, determination and ability\u2019. He added, \u2018I have never had any doubt\nabout their sincerity, their deep devotion to the cause of their people and their\ndesire to see that South Africa become a country in which all people participate.\u2019\nHe told the judge that the exercise of clemency in this case was of great\nimportance for the future of the country.\nIn a move virtually unprecedented in the South African courts, Yutar rose to\nlaunch an attack on Paton\u2019s character. \u2018I propose to cross-examine this witness\nwith Your Lordship\u2019s leave. And I don\u2019t do so in order to aggravate the\nsentence, but in order to unmask this gentleman and make perfectly clear that his\nonly reason for going into the witness box, in my submission, is to make\n\n\fpolitical propaganda from the witness box.\u2019\nYutar implied that Paton was a fellow-traveller of the Communist Party and\nthat he moved readily in communist circles. He questioned his actions in asking\ncountries abroad to maintain their concern about the injustices of apartheid. As\nthe smears continued, Paton became angry and confused. The security police\nwitnessing the spectacle tittered.\nIt was left to Harold Hanson to restore some sense of propriety to the\nproceedings. He spoke eloquently, saying a nation\u2019s grievances could not be\nsuppressed, people would always find a way to give voice to those grievances.\n\u2018It was not their aims which had been criminal,\u2019 said Hanson, \u2018only the means to\nwhich they had resorted.\u2019 He reminded the judge that his own Afrikaner people,\nduring their struggle against British imperialism, had conducted armed uprising,\nrebellion and treason and had appeared for such offences before courts which\nhad decided to show leniency. Two Boer generals, de Wet and Kemp, charged\nwith high treason after leading an armed rebellion against the government in\n, had been sentenced to no more than six years\u2019 imprisonment.\nDe Wet appeared to pay scant attention to these arguments. He neither looked\nup nor made notes. When Hanson had finished, he nodded to the accused to rise.\nI have heard a great deal during the course of this case about the\ngrievances of the non-European population. The accused have told me\nand their counsel have told me that the accused, who were all leaders of\nthe non-European population, were motivated entirely by a desire to\nameliorate these grievances. I am by no means convinced that the\nmotives of the accused were as altruistic as they wish the court to\nbelieve. People who organize a revolution usually take over the\ngovernment and personal ambition cannot be excluded as a motive.\nDe Wet paused for a moment, then continued, his voice quieter than before,\nmaking it hard for the public gallery to hear what he was saying:\nThe function of this court, as is the function of the court in any other country, is\nto enforce law and order and to enforce the laws of the state within which it\nfunctions. The crime of which the accused have been convicted, that is the main\ncrime, the crime of conspiracy, is in essence one of high treason. The state has\ndecided not to charge the crime in this form. Bearing this in mind and giving the\nmatter very serious consideration, I have decided not to impose the supreme\npenalty. . .\n\n\fThere was a gasp of relief, but the judge was continuing:\nwhich in a case like this would usually be the proper penalty for the crime, but\nconsistent with my duty that is the only leniency which I can show. The sentence\nin the case of all the accused will be one of life imprisonment.\nMandela smiled at his comrades and turned to look for Winnie and his mother\nin the gallery. But there was consternation among many there who had not heard\nthe sentence. Goldberg\u2019s mother cried out in desperation, \u2018Denis! What is it?\u2019\n\u2018Life!\u2019 he shouted back, \u2018Life! To live!\u2019 Then they all disappeared out of sight\nfor the last time, down the courtroom steps to the cells below.\nTheir lawyers stood in silence, then each shook hands silently with Bram\nFischer. \u2018It had been his responsibility in the first place to save their lives,\u2019\nremarked Joffe, \u2018and it was his victory in the first place that they would live.\u2019\nThe outcome of the Rivonia trial made little impact on white public opinion\nother than to reassure the white population that the government had succeeded in\novercoming serious threats to their well-being. The press praised the police, the\nprosecutor and the judge. Reaction abroad, however, was very different. \u2018The\nverdict of history,\u2019 prophesied the London Times, \u2018will be that the ultimate guilty\nparty is the government in power\u2014and that already is the verdict of world\nopinion.\u2019 The New York Times concurred: \u2018To most of the world, these men are\nheroes and freedom fighters. The George Washingtons and Ben Franklins of\nSouth Africa.\u2019\nFrom his own lonely outpost in the mission village of Groutville, to which he\nwas restricted, Chief Luthuli, who had remained so adamantly opposed to\nviolence, issued his own verdict:\nIn the face of the uncompromising white refusal to abandon a policy which\ndenies the African and other oppressed South Africans their rightful heritage\u2014\nfreedom\u2014no one can blame brave just men for seeking justice by the use of\nviolent methods; nor could they be blamed if they tried to create an organized\nforce in order to ultimately establish peace and racial harmony.\nFor this, they are sentenced to be shut away for long years in the brutal and\ndegrading prisons of South Africa. With them will be interred this country\u2019s\nhopes for racial cooperation.\nHis words could not be quoted in South Africa and so went unheard.\n\n\fIn the early hours of  June , Mandela and the other African prisoners\nwere taken from their cells in Pretoria Local and put on a military transport\naircraft for the flight to Robben Island. As dawn came, they could see below the\nmountains and forests of the Western Cape. The terrain excited Mandela. He saw\nit \u2018not as a tourist but as a strategist, looking for areas where a guerrilla army\nmight hide itself\u2019. Even after being sentenced to life imprisonment for a forlorn\nand futile campaign of violence against the government, he could still not shake\noff his ambition to be a guerrilla leader.\n\nIn terms of the objectives that Mandela set out in court during the Rivonia trial,\nUmkhonto\u2019s sabotage campaign was a total failure. The impact on the economy\nwas negligible. Foreign investors, far from being frightened away, became more\ndeeply involved. Foreign governments, while vociferous in condemning\napartheid, were still content to sit on the sidelines. There was much debate about\neconomic sanctions but little action.\nThe white electorate remained largely unaffected by the sporadic nature of\nsabotage attacks and reacted by demanding not reform, as Mandela had\nanticipated, but tougher action, thus allowing the government to take ever more\nrepressive counter-measures in the name of law and order. At each successive\nelection, the National Party gained higher levels of white support.\nBy making unlimited use of the ninety-day detention laws, the security police\nsoon broke the back of all underground resistance. Subjected to solitary\nconfinement and prolonged interrogation, allowed no visitors or reading material\nexcept the Bible, detainees were constantly taunted with the threat that they\ncould be held in such conditions indefinitely. Their \u2018cracking point\u2019 varied.\nWriting of her own experience of being held incommunicado for  days, Ruth\nFirst, a member of the Communist Party\u2019s central committee, noted, \u2018Men\nholding key positions in the political movement, who had years of hard political\nexperience and sacrifice behind them, cracked like eggshells. Others, with quiet,\nreticent, self-effacing natures, who had been woolly in making decisions and\nslow to carry them out, emerged from long spells of isolation shaken but\nunbroken.\u2019 Where interrogation methods failed, torture usually succeeded.\n\u2018Under torture,\u2019 said Ben Turok, \u2018many victims found to their regret that they\nknew too much and that the police knew that they knew.\u2019\n\n\fIn the wake of the Rivonia raid, Umkhonto endeavoured to establish a new\nhigh command, whose members included Wilton Mkwayi, a China-trained\nsaboteur, and David Kitson, a young Communist Party instructor who had been\ndue to attend the Lilliesleaf meeting in July  but had fortuitously been\nconfined to bed with influenza. A key figure in setting up the new arrangement\nwas Bram Fischer, who, even during the course of the Rivonia trial, remained\nactively involved in the underground. Fischer and Kitson would meet in Greek\ncaf\u00e9s on Nuggett Street in Johannesburg, where Fischer would pass on funds for\nUmkhonto obtained from abroad and even copies of maps and sabotage targets\ncaptured from Lilliesleaf which had been handed to Fischer by the prosecution in\nthe normal course of court proceedings. However ingenious such activities were,\nthey came to naught. Soon after the end of the Rivonia trial, Kitson and Mkwayi\nwere arrested. By mid-, Umkhonto was effectively crushed.\nThe same fate befell the other sabotage group, the National Committee of\nLiberation, or the African Resistance Movement as it eventually became known.\nThe ARM was little more than a collection of white middle-class dissidents,\nabout fifty in number, former communists, Trotskyists and Liberal Party radicals\nwho had set themselves the task of helping to bring about the downfall of\napartheid without any clear idea of how this was to be achieved other than by\nrandom sabotage strikes. Following the departure abroad of its founder, Monty\nBerman, the ARM\u2019s main organiser became a twenty-four-year-old former\nstudent leader based in Cape Town, Adrian Leftwich. Leftwich was a competent\nadministrator who kept detailed records of ARM members and activities in his\nflat.\nThough some members began questioning the wisdom of continuing with\nsabotage, Leftwich remained an ardent enthusiast. In April , at an ARM\nmeeting in Johannesburg, when a Coloured member, Eddie Daniels, argued that\nsabotage was a counterproductive strategy that should be abandoned, Leftwich\nattacked his attitude as cowardly. What he proposed instead was a series of\nsabotage attacks to coincide with the sentencing of the Rivonia trialists. On \nJune, a number of power pylons were toppled.\nThe security police responded with a series of raids on the homes and offices\nof dissidents they had so far neglected. Leftwich\u2019s flat, with its large archive of\nARM documents, was one of them. Within a few days, Leftwich had \u2018cracked\u2019,\nsupplying his interrogators with all the information on members, addresses and\noperations they required to roll up the organisation. Leftwich went on to\n\n\fcompound this betrayal of his friends and colleagues by testifying against them\nin one trial after another, gaining his own freedom in exile in return.\nThe end of the sabotage era was marked by an incident which to most whites\njustified all the security measures the government had enforced. On  July, one\nof the few remaining activists still at large, John Harris, a Liberal Party member,\nfilled a suitcase with explosives and a detonator and left it in the white section of\nJohannesburg\u2019s main railway station. It exploded, killing an elderly woman,\nmaiming a child and injuring a score of other whites. Harris was subsequently\nhanged, the only white saboteur ever to be executed in South Africa. More than\nany other episode, the bombing was used by the government to assert the evil\nnature of all anti-apartheid opponents.\nOne last defiant stand was taken against the government, a personal stand\nmade by Bram Fischer. For the duration of the Rivonia trial, Fischer had\nacquired a form of immunity which no one expected to last once the trial was\nover. He had managed to avoid being identified by farm workers and servants at\nLilliesleaf called as witnesses in the trial by making sure he was engaged on\nother legal business elsewhere when they appeared in court. But his handwriting\non documents found at Lilliesleaf provided evidence less easily circumvented.\nOne document identified by a handwriting expert as being written by Harold\nWolpe was passed by the prosecutor in court to Fischer, who looked at it without\na trace of concern and then passed it to the rest of his team, who, aghast, saw\nonly too clearly that it had been written by Fischer. But the prosecution had\nother examples of Fischer\u2019s handwriting which they chose, for reasons of\nconvenience, not to identify at the time. Percy Yutar would simply say, \u2018There is\na document here, My Lord, which is in somebody else\u2019s handwriting . . . \u2019\nFischer\u2019s fate, in fact, was already sealed. Unknown to him, the senior ranks\nof the Communist Party had been penetrated by a police agent, Gerard Ludi,\nproviding the security police with enough information to wipe out its entire\nstructure. What evidence they lacked was subsequently obtained from a senior\nfigure in the Communist Party, Piet Beyleveld, who agreed to testify against his\nformer colleagues, including Fischer, in exchange for his own freedom. A\nmember of the party\u2019s central committee, Bartholomew Hlapane, also defected\nand was used as a state witness in one trial after another.\nNot only was Fischer\u2019s political world on the verge of disintegration, but his\npersonal life was suddenly afflicted by personal tragedy. On the day after the\n\n\fsentence in the Rivonia trial was given, Fischer and his wife, Molly, left\nJohannesburg by car for a holiday in the Cape. On the way there, approaching a\nbridge over a river, Fischer swerved to avoid a motorcyclist. The car left the road\nand plunged into a waterhole some thirty feet deep. Fischer managed to escape,\nbut Molly was pinned in the back and drowned.\nIn September , Fischer and thirteen other white communists were\narrested and charged with membership of the illegal Communist Party. Fischer at\nthe time was acting chairman of the central committee, the last survivor of the\noriginal s central committee. Released on bail, he was given permission to\nfly to London to argue an international patents case before the Privy Council,\nwhich his client subsequently won. In London, friends tried to persuade him to\nremain there, but Fischer believed not only that it would be dishonourable to\njump bail but that his place was in South Africa. He returned to face trial.\nBut in January , Fischer decided to go underground in a last act of\ndefiance against the might of the apartheid state. He explained his reasons in a\nletter to the court:\nWhat is needed is for white South Africans to shake themselves out of their\ncomplacency. . . . Unless this whole intolerable system is changed radically and\nrapidly, disaster must follow. . . . To try to avoid this becomes a supreme duty,\nparticularly for an Afrikaner, because it is largely representatives of my fellow\nAfrikaners who have been responsible for the worst of these discriminatory laws.\n. . . If by my fight I can encourage even some people to think about, to\nunderstand and to abandon the policies they now so blindly follow, I shall not\nregret any punishment I may incur.\nHe concluded, \u2018I can no longer serve justice in the way I have attempted to do\nduring the past thirty years. I can do it only in the way I have now chosen.\u2019\nUsing a variety of disguises, Fischer evaded capture until November .\nBrought to trial, he was found guilty of conspiring, along with the Rivonia\ntrialists he had defended, to commit sabotage and, at the age of fifty-seven,\nsentenced to life imprisonment.\nFischer was the last of the conspirators to remain at large in South Africa. By\n no active revolutionaries survived there. Those activists who managed to\nevade arrest soon fled the country, joining a small coterie of exiles based in\nLondon. Rusty Bernstein, released on bail after the Rivonia trial, was one of\nthem. Others, like Ruth First and Wolfie Kodesh, accepted the government\u2019s\n\n\foffer of a one-way exit permit.\nHow widespread resistance against the government had been was shown in a\nseries of trials across the country. Nearly , people were charged with\noffences linked to political defiance. Most were convicted and imprisoned, some\nfor life, some for fifteen or twenty years, others for lesser periods. Nearly fifty\nmen were sentenced to death. Most of the trials were held in relative obscurity.\n\nIn trying to explain the collapse of Umkhonto, Joe Slovo spoke of \u2018an heroic\nfailure\u2019. The reality, however, was that right from the start the conspirators had\nmade a fatal miscalculation about the power of the government and the ways in\nwhich the government was willing to use it. They also underestimated the\neffectiveness of police techniques. \u2018Having talked of fascism for a decade or\nmore, the movements were nevertheless caught by surprise when the police\nbehaved like fascists,\u2019 noted Ben Turok. All the other mistakes and errors\ncommitted by the conspirators\u2014the \u2018mood of carelessness and bravado\u2019 which\nSlovo admitted had overtaken the conspirators, the neglect of political work\namong their African constituency that Kotane wanted to continue, the failure to\ndevelop a real underground organisation of the kind that Mandela had once\nproposed\u2014all this merely compounded the process of defeat. Whatever reasons\nwere given, what was ultimately proved was that a collection of amateur\nrevolutionaries were no match for the brute strength of the South African state.\nThe price for this miscalculation was huge. With the nationalist movement\ndestroyed, a silence descended for more than a decade. On Robben Island,\nMandela and his colleagues became largely forgotten men. PRISONER /\nTHE WINTER OF  ON ROBBEN ISLAND, WHEN MANDELA AND\nSIX other Rivonia prisoners arrived there, was the coldest that anyone could\nremember. So fierce were the Atlantic winds sweeping across the island that\nprisoners working in the quarries were numbed to the bone, hardly able to raise\ntheir picks; at night they huddled together in groups, desperate for warmth. On\nthe day that the Dakota aircraft bringing the Rivonia men landed, it was bitterly\ncold, wet and windy.\nIn the year since Mandela had left the island, a new maximum security prison\nhad been constructed, close to Murray\u2019s Bay harbour, not far from the old prison\nbuildings. A special section within it, a single-storey rectangular block with a\ncement courtyard in the centre, had been built at the southeastern corner of the\ncompound to house prisoners whom the authorities wanted to isolate from the\nmass of the prison population. This prison within a prison was intended to be the\nhome of the Rivonia group for the rest of their lives.\nMandela\u2019s cell, like the others in B Section, was no more than about seven\nfeet square. A barred window looked out on to a cement courtyard and beyond it\nto a high wall patrolled by guards. The walls of the cell were damp. There was\nno bed. Mandela was provided with a sisal mat on which to sleep, three flimsy\nblankets, a toilet bucket and a plastic bottle of water. In the winter months, his\ncell was so cold he slept fully dressed in prison garb. Outside the cell was fixed a\nwhite card giving his name and identification number: /.\nAs well as the Rivonia group, a number of other political prisoners were\nbrought to the isolation section, or the koeloekoetz, as it was known, from the\nmain communal prison blocks. Among them were Zephenia Mothopeng, a PAC\nleader; Dennis Brutus, a Coloured poet and writer, once active in campaigning\nfor a sports boycott of South Africa, who had been imprisoned for contravening\nhis banning orders; Neville Alexander and Fikile Bam, both members of an\nobscure Maoist group known as the Yu Chi Chan Club, which had dabbled with\n\n\fthe idea of guerrilla warfare; and Andrew Masondo, a mathematics lecturer from\nFort Hare University, who had become an MK saboteur. In the following months\nthis group was joined by other se - nior MK figures, including Wilton Mkwayi,\nJoe Gqabi, Mac Maharaj and Michael Dingake. Another arrival was Eddie\nDaniels, a Coloured member of the ill-fated African Resistance Movement.\nTogether with the Rivonia group, this motley collection of prisoners, numbering\nin all about thirty, provided Mandela\u2019s companions for the years ahead.\nThough the prison buildings were new, the regime remained as harsh and as\nbrutal as before. Prisoners in the general section were crowded into large\ncommunal cells where few toilets were available. Food rations were meagre.\nPrisoners reporting sick were often turned away by hospital orderlies, castigated\nfor laziness when they were seriously ill; some gained admission to hospital only\nwhen it was too late to save them.\nSeveral incidents had occurred to add to the island\u2019s infamous reputation. For\nwork purposes, prisoners were divided up into different teams or spans, as they\nwere known. Most were sent to work in the stone quarries; others went to the\nharbour, the laundry or the stores. The work most dreaded was with the\nlandbouspan, the agricultural team run by Piet Kleynhans, one of three\nKleynhans brothers then employed on Robben Island. One of the tasks of the\nlandbouspan was to push a huge grass roller, seven feet high and weighing\nseveral tons, on which Kleynhans would sit perched on the crossbar, shouting\nand swearing and flicking a leather whip at the prisoners. The roller was so\nheavy that as many as fifty prisoners were needed to move it, hauling it by a\nheavy handle and long chains attached to each side and pushing from the back.\nThe work began in the early morning and went on for hour after hour, with\nguards routinely lashing out at prisoners with canes and hosepipes, cursing them\nfor their laziness.\nOne morning, Kleynhans singled out for punishment a PAC leader, Johnson\nMlambo, whom he had heard complaining about the work. While other prisoners\ncontinued hauling the roller round in circles, Kleynhans instructed two convicts\nto dig a hole deep enough to hold a man and then ordered Mlambo to get into it.\nThe convicts then filled in the hole with soil, leaving only Mlambo\u2019s head jutting\nout above the ground. He remained there for the rest of the morning, his head\nbaking in the sun. At midday, Kleynhans, clearly enjoying himself, went up to\nMlambo and asked him, \u2018Kaffir, soek jy water?\u2019\u2014\u2018Kaffir, do you want water?\u2019\n\u2018Nee ek sal jou nie water gee nie, ek sal hou whisky gee, die beste\n\n\fwhisky!\u2019\u2014\u2018No, I won\u2019t give you water, I\u2019ll give you whisky, the very best!\u2019 As\nother warders looked on laughing, Kleynhans pulled out his penis and urinated\non Mlambo\u2019s face. Shortly afterwards, at the lunch break, Mlambo was dug out\nof the hole and told to join other prisoners for the afternoon work shift on the\nroller. Mlambo was later to lose an eye; it was gouged out by another PAC\nprisoner during a fight over food.\nIn March , the prison authorities ordered a carry-on\u2014a mass assault\u2014\ninvolving political prisoners who had complained about work conditions in the\nstone quarry. One of their main targets was Andrew Masondo, whose arm was\nseverely injured in the beatings that took place. The carry-on was witnessed by\nDennis Brutus, who had arrived on Robben Island only the day before: \u2018We saw\ndozens of prisoners running wild or crawling vainly under barbed-wire fences\nwhile the batons, staves and pick-handles of the warders fell indiscriminately\nand mercilessly.\u2019 Later in the day, Brutus himself, still recovering from a police\nbullet wound in the stomach, was caught up in the carry-on when he and other\nprisoners were ordered to wade into the sea to collect seaweed. There, in the\nwater, they were set upon by warders armed with batons and rubber pipes:\nI do not think I will ever be able to erase from my mind the images that day of\nterror and violence by the sea with the bright water and the bright sunlight, and\nthe men struggling with shiny masses of seaweed and on the sharp slippery rocks\n. . . and all the time men were beaten and kicked and the batons thwacked.\nAll attempts at taking legal action against the prison authorities were thwarted.\nPrisoners queueing at the dispensary for medical attention were frequently\nassaulted. One warder named Mostert, a huge ox of a man, made a practice of\nwalking along the queue, punching prisoners as he went, until only the most\ncourageous remained standing. He used to say, to justify his conduct, \u2018If you\ndon\u2019t run away, then you are really sick, you actually need treatment.\u2019\nSince Mandela\u2019s first incarceration on Robben Island, the prison staff had\nbecome exclusively white. No longer were there any Coloured warders to offer a\nfriendly hand. An atmosphere of racial hostility was ever present. White warders\nregarded themselves as members of a master race and accordingly required\nprisoners to adopt a servile manner. They insisted on being addressed as \u2018baas\u2019\nand referred contemptuously to prisoners as \u2018kaffirs\u2019, \u2018hotnots\u2019 and \u2018koelies\u2019.\nThey were used to dealing with hardened criminals, employing only the most\nbrutal methods, and treated political prisoners with similar vindictiveness,\n\n\fhanding out punishment at the slightest sign of defiance. Their objective was to\ndestroy the morale of prisoners, to strip them of dignity and self-respect. It was\nwhat the system required.\nFrom previous experience, Mandela knew how crushing the effects of prison\nlife could be. The burden to be carried was not just constant abuse from warders\nand hardship at work, but the sheer tedium of prison routine, stretching for ever\ninto the distance, week after week, month after month, year after year.\nMandela\u2019s first prison sentence had at least been limited to a fixed term of five\nyears. The Rivonia trial had meanwhile engaged his full attention, keeping him\nclose to lawyers, relatives and friends. But back on Robben Island, the full\nimpact of his new sentence now took its toll. At the age of forty-six, the prospect\nbefore him was spending the rest of his life in a cell.\nThe first weeks were particularly difficult. Prisoners in the isolation section\nwere subjected to rigid control, their every move dictated by a posse of warders\nready to pounce on any infringement of the regulations. The routine was\ndeadening. The morning bell rang at : a.m. Prisoners were required to roll up\ntheir mats and blankets and clean their cells, but were not allowed out until :\na.m. Mandela used the time for exercising. In the cramped space of his cell, he\nfound that by standing at an angle he could wave his arms about. At : a.m.,\nprisoners were let out to clean their toilet buckets in sinks at the end of the\ncorridor, giving them a brief opportunity for a few whispered words if warders\nwere not lingering about there. Back in their cells, breakfast, consisting of maize\nporridge and what was described as coffee, was delivered to them by convicts\nfrom the general section. At inspection after breakfast, prisoners were required\nto doff their cloth caps to warders as they passed by. If the buttons on their\ncanvas jackets were undone or if they failed to doff their caps, they were\npunished with either loss of meals or solitary confinement.\nThey were then taken out to the courtyard, where for hour after hour, sitting\ncross-legged in four rows, forbidden to talk, they bashed away with five-pound\nhammers at piles of stones in front of them, crushing them into fine gravel. Not\nuntil lunch break at noon were they permitted to rest. Lunch consisted once\nagain of boiled maize and a drink known as phuzamandla made from maize and\na bit of yeast. In the afternoon, they were allowed to exercise for half an hour\nunder strict supervision, walking in silence around the courtyard in single file,\nbefore resuming their places at the rock piles.\n\n\fWork ended at  p.m., when they were given half an hour to clean up using\nthe seawater showers and buckets in a bathroom at the end of the corridor.\nSupper, consisting of maize porridge with a piece of vegetable or meat gristle\nadded, came at : p.m., delivered to the cells by convicts. At  p.m., the night\nwarder ordered everyone to go to sleep, but each cell\u2019s single light bulb\nremained glowing throughout the night. At weekends, prisoners were kept inside\ntheir cells all day, except for half an hour of exercise. No prisoner was allowed\nto possess a watch or clock. Everyone was ruled by bells and the whistles and\nshouts of warders.\nAll political prisoners were automatically given the lowest classification,\ncategory D, according them a minimum of privileges. Category D prisoners were\nallowed to have only one visitor in every six months and to write and receive\nonly one letter in the same period. Sometimes letters were handed over so\nheavily censored that they made no sense; sometimes they were never handed\nover at all. No study privileges were permitted. The only way for prisoners to\ngain a higher classification and hence more privileges was through what the\nauthorities deemed to be good behaviour. Prisoners who eventually won a high\nclassification could be threatened with demotion and hence the loss of privileges\n\u2014visits, letters and studies\u2014if they were insufficiently compliant.\nThe only solace in this grim schedule was the company of friends. The\ncourage that each man showed fortified the determination of others to stand firm.\nWalter Sisulu, in particular, proved a constant source of strength for Mandela\nand for many other prisoners, always ready to comfort them in moments of\nanguish and despair, no matter how hard his own burden at the time. \u2018Even when\nhis own wife and children were put in jail, he was an inspiration,\u2019 recalled\nKathrada. \u2018I could always turn to him for help.\u2019\nBut inmates in the koeloekoetz were far from being a harmonious group. The\nold rivalry between the PAC and the ANC provoked continual bouts of friction.\nIn the general section, hostility between the two groups was an open sore. The\nreaction of PAC members to the outcome of the Rivonia trial was typical. \u2018They\nwere very disappointed when none of the Rivonia people was sentenced to\ndeath,\u2019 recalled an ANC prisoner, Ebrahim Ismail Ebrahim. There was also\nfriction between Neville Alexander and ANC members. Alexander, an\nintellectual with a doctorate in literature from Germany, initially dismissed ANC\nprisoners as \u2018ordinary nationalists inferior to us socialists . . . almost\ncollaborators\u2019. Nor was it long before members of the Rivonia group were\n\n\fembroiled in their own disputes.\nMandela\u2019s plan for survival on Robben Island involved challenging the\nsystem with a series of complaints aimed at improving prison conditions. Prison\nlife he came to regard as a microcosm of the apartheid system outside, requiring\na similar struggle for basic rights. Striving for better conditions gave him both a\nset of attainable objectives and a sense of purpose otherwise missing in the\nmonotony of prison routine. He hoped to achieve results through negotiation\nrather than confrontation. This meant according a measure of respect to the\nprison authorities which several of his own colleagues found difficult to accept.\nPAC members refused outright to have any dealings with the prison authorities,\nnever lodging complaints of any kind, regarding such contacts as a form of\ncollaboration. Mandela\u2019s argument was that not only would each advance raise\nthe morale of prisoners but the process of negotiation itself would require the\nprison authorities to show a measure of respect for prisoners\u2019 interests. It would\nhelp break down the walls of prejudice.\nThe complaints procedure had hitherto been a meaningless ritual. Once a\nweek, prisoners were lined up and asked if they had any complaints or requests.\nMany complaints were made\u2014about food, about clothes, about blankets, about\nvisits\u2014but no note was ever taken and nothing was ever done. Prisoners who\npursued complaints about assaults faced reprisal. No one succeeded in gaining\nredress.\nMandela\u2019s first complaint was about the prison clothes he was given to wear.\nAfrican prisoners were issued with a pair of short trousers, a coarse collarless\nkhaki shirt, a canvas jacket and a thin jersey. In true apartheid tradition, Indian\nprisoners, like Kathrada, were allowed long trousers. Mandela objected to\nwearing short trousers on the grounds that they were demeaning, intended to\nremind Africans of their position as \u2018boys\u2019. Though his initial protest was\nignored, after two weeks he was given a pair of long trousers. Since no other\nAfrican prisoner was given long trousers, he declined to accept them and\ncontinued to wear short trousers. But he had made a start. When he complained\nabout the dampness of his cell, he was told by a prison official, \u2018The dampness\nof the cells will eventually be absorbed by your bodies.\u2019\nAlong with other political prisoners in the isolation section, he refused to\naddress warders as baas. In the general section, any such refusal would incur\nswift punishment\u2014a beating, a loss of meals or solitary confinement if\n\n\fnecessary. But the koeloekoetz men stood firm and warders left the issue alone.\nWhen the quotas of stone-crushing set for prisoners working in the courtyard\nwere repeatedly raised, they resolved not to meet them. The warders threatened\nthem, but did not succeed in getting their way.\nWith each case of complaint, Mandela took on the authorities in a polite but\nresolute manner, in the process gaining not only the attention of warders but the\nrespect of critics within the prisoner community. Neville Alexander, who was\nserving a ten-year sentence, recalled, \u2018We were terribly impetuous and would\nhave run ourselves suicidally against the prison walls.\u2019 But Mandela and Sisulu\nhad argued that, by adopting a dignified and disciplined approach, \u2018eventually\nwe would break through\u2019. The impact that both men made on Alexander was\nconsiderable: \u2018Nelson and Walter taught me to respect people, to disagree with\nthem, but to continue to respect them.\u2019\nThough prison regulations stipulated that each prisoner was permitted to speak\nonly for himself, not on behalf of others, the prison authorities soon found it\nexpedient to use Mandela as a spokesman for prisoner interests. When an official\nfrom the International Red Cross arrived on Robben Island, Mandela was singled\nout to talk to him and on subsequent occasions he continued to act as the\nprisoners\u2019 representative. Mandela dwelt at length on prisoners\u2019 grievances over\nfood, clothing, letters and such matters as the conduct of warders, unsure of\nwhether any worthwhile result might be achieved. Not long afterward, African\nprisoners were issued with long trousers.\nHe became adept at concealing his emotions behind a mask, rarely letting any\nsign of anger or bitterness emerge and never betraying doubt or despair before\nothers. He built around himself a wall of self-discipline, steeling himself to face\nwhatever ordeal prison might hold. He came to distrust emotion, prizing reason\nand logic above all else, recognising that bitterness would bring him no closer to\nhis goal. Time and again, he held back his anger at the taunts and insults from\nprison staff. Warders enjoyed goading Mandela by letting him know that they\nwere withholding a letter for him\u2014his main lifeline to the outside world. \u2018It\nrequired all my self-discipline not to explode at such times,\u2019 he wrote.\n\u2018Afterward, I would protest through the proper channels, and sometimes get it.\u2019\nWith other prisoners, Mandela exercised the same degree of self-control,\nnever showing any sign of weakness, always conscious of the effect his\nleadership had on them. Only Sisulu was privy to the inner man. With everyone\n\n\felse, even with old friends like Kathrada, Mandela distanced himself with a\nmeasure of aloofness. Kathrada noted his ability in prison to react in a cool\nmanner, no matter how serious the issue was: \u2018He would return from a meeting\nwith a prison official, having heard of some momentous issue or having had a\nmessage of great importance, then come back to the cells, joke with us, talk to\nus, then relate what had happened very casually.\u2019 Kathrada often found it\ndifficult to tell what was in his mind.\nHis darkest moments, he faced alone. Some of them came during periods of\nsolitary confinement. As he wrote in a manuscript while in prison:\nThe worst part of imprisonment is being locked up by yourself. You come face\nto face with time and there is nothing more terrifying than to be alone with sheer\ntime. Then the ghosts come crowding in. They can be very sinister, very\nmischievous, raising a thousand doubts in your mind about the people outside,\ntheir loyalty. Was your sacrifice worth the trouble? What would your life have\nbeen like if you hadn\u2019t got involved?\nHe also had to endure times of great personal anguish, but never betrayed how\ndeeply he had been hurt.\nWhatever doubts and despair he suffered, in the company of others he\nremained steadfast, always seeking to bolster their morale. And he never gave up\nhope that one day he would emerge from prison a free man. \u2018I never thought that\na life sentence truly meant life and that I would die behind bars,\u2019 he said in his\nautobiography. \u2018Perhaps I was denying this prospect because it was too\nunpleasant to contemplate.\u2019\n\nYet, events in prison were not the only cause of Mandela\u2019s concerns. In August\n, two months after he had been back on the island, Mandela was allowed a\nvisit from Winnie. They met in a cramped cubicle in the visiting room, separated\nby a partition, able to see each other only through a pane of thick, smudged\nglass. Their conversation was carried on through holes drilled in the partition.\nBoth had been warned that the only topics permitted were family and personal\nmatters. Warders stood by on either side of the partition, listening carefully to\nwhat was said, ready to interrupt if unfamiliar names were mentioned or if the\nconversation seemed to stray beyond bounds. They were given just thirty\nminutes together.\n\n\fWinnie appeared to Mandela to be under tremendous strain. He had known\nthat his imprisonment would leave her exposed to hardship and hazards with few\nsources of support. In a letter written to her on the eve of his first term of\nimprisonment, he had tried to offer her every encouragement for the long and\nlonely road she faced, urging her to act with fortitude and dignity and warning of\nthe traps that would be set for her. It was a letter full of love and inspiration\nwhich Winnie cherished, reading it time and again until it was seized by security\npolice during one of their periodic raids on her house in Orlando West.\nWhat worried Mandela most was that Winnie\u2019s impetuous and headstrong\nnature would lead her into ever deeper trouble. In the treacherous world of South\nAfrican politics, she was a novice, na\u00efve and gullible, and easy prey for the\nsecurity police. The story often told about her during her early years of marriage\nwas that while Mandela was engaged in serious debate in the front room of their\nhouse, Winnie would be found in the back reading a women\u2019s magazine. She\nhad joined the ANC Women\u2019s League and done a two-week spell in prison for\nher part in protesting against pass laws, but among political activists she was\nregarded as being a lightweight.\nOnce Mandela was in prison, however, Winnie became more ambitious. She\nsaw herself as Mandela\u2019s heir, capable of acting on his behalf. Towards other\nactivists, she adopted a superior manner, making herself unpopular with them.\n\u2018Winnie always acted on her own,\u2019 recalled Rusty Bernstein. \u2018She wouldn\u2019t\ncooperate with anyone. She refused to take advice. She was an individual piece\nof militancy, a rogue element.\u2019\nShe also had a propensity for becoming involved with shady characters. She\nmaintained a long friendship with Maude Katzellenbogen, the partner of a\ncorrupt Indian businessman, Moosa Dinath, convicted of fraud, who had once\ntried to inveigle her into a reckless scheme to free Mandela from prison in\nJohannesburg, even though she knew he had dubious connections with the\ngovernment.\nShe also developed a close relationship with Brian Somana, a journalist who\nhad acted as her driver on journeys to see Mandela at Lilliesleaf Farm. Somana\nhad been arrested in June , shortly before the police raid on Lilliesleaf took\nplace. In activist circles, he was widely suspected of being a police informer,\npossibly the source of their information on Lilliesleaf.\nOn Robben Island, Mandela was aware of both Somana\u2019s role as a police\n\n\finformer and Winnie\u2019s involvement with him. One of his own colleagues in the\nisolation section, Fikile Bam, had encountered them while he was on the run\nfrom the police in August . A graduate of the University of Cape Town, he\nhad known Winnie since his youth in the Transkei; his sister had been her close\nfriend. While a student at St Peter\u2019s in Johannesburg, he had been befriended by\nOliver Tambo, who had enabled him to gain experience of the workings of the\nlaw by arranging for him to help out at the firm of Mandela and Tambo on\nSaturdays. He subsequently became involved with Neville Alexander\u2019s Maoist\ngroup in Cape Town.\nWanted by the police for distributing literature on guerrilla warfare in Cape\nTown, he fled to Johannesburg, where Winnie, hearing of his predicament,\noffered to arrange his escape to neighbouring Bechuanaland and turned to\nSomana for help. On the day arranged for his escape, Somana turned up driving\nWinnie\u2019s car, with Mandela\u2019s two daughters in the back. They had travelled only\na short distance when they ran straight into a roadblock manned by police, who\nhad clearly been expecting them. Bam was to spend ten years on Robben Island.\nWord soon spread that Winnie was not to be trusted, making her more isolated\nand vulnerable than before. Bram Fischer warned her about Somana and tried to\npersuade her to leave South Africa to get her out of the way, but she refused to\nheed him. In London, Oliver Tambo told colleagues that they should no longer\ntake Winnie into their confidence.\nDespite all this, Winnie and Somana remained close. According to Somana\u2019s\nwife, they lived together in Winnie\u2019s Orlando house from May , when the\nRivonia trial was still under way, until December . On one occasion,\nSomana was arrested in Winnie\u2019s house during a  a.m. police raid. Winnie was\nsubsequently cited in Somana\u2019s divorce case, though she flatly denied adultery.\nShe also became involved with Somana in a business enterprise which he was\nable to finance from a sudden and unexplained flow of funds. According to\nWinnie\u2019s testimony in a subsequent court case, concerning an arson attack on\nher garage, their business partnership foundered \u2018because of rumours that it was\nfinanced out of reward money offered by the police for the capture of Walter\nSisulu\u2019.\nThere was nothing that Mandela could do from Robben Island to curb\nWinnie\u2019s wayward conduct. He blamed himself for being unable to offer her the\nprotection she evidently needed, and his sense of guilt and frustration mounted\n\n\fas the security police instigated a campaign of persecution against Winnie which\ncontinued year after year.\nThe first banning order on Winnie, issued in , restricted her movements\nto the Johannesburg area and prohibited her from attending meetings and social\ngatherings. Only by obtaining official permission was she allowed to travel to\nPretoria to attend the Rivonia trial or to Cape Town to visit Mandela in prison on\nRobben Island. A second banning order, in , restricted her movements\nfurther, forcing her to leave her job as a social worker with the Child Welfare\nSociety in Johannesburg, a position she cherished. She took a succession of other\njobs, working in a furniture shop, a dry-cleaning shop and a shoe-repair shop,\nbut at each place she was fired after security police paid a visit to her employers.\nShe was charged on several occasions with violating her banning order, often for\nno more than trivial infringements, usually ending up with a suspended sentence\nor a fine.\nHer house was often raided. In her autobiography, she recalled an incident in\nwhich a white police sergeant walked into her bedroom without knocking while\nshe was half-dressed and put his hand on her shoulder: \u2018All I remember is\ngrabbing him, and throwing him on the floor, which is what he deserved. I\nremember seeing his legs up in the air and him screaming, and the whole\ndressing-stand falling on him. That is how he broke his neck (he did recover).\u2019\nIn the subsequent court case, Winnie was defended by George Bizos. She\nwrote:\nI would listen to him as I would listen to my father. He treats me in the same\nway as Nelson does. He weighs the same authority with us. So he says to me\noutside court, \u2018I want you to behave like a lady in front of the magistrate and not\nlike an Amazon!\u2019 Nelson always says to me\u2014\u2018Zami, you are completely and\nutterly undisciplined! You need a great deal of taming!\u2019 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m\nundisciplined. But you have to use the language they understand: to have peace,\nyou must be violent.\nWinnie won the case.\nAs well as harassing Winnie, the security police turned their attention to her\ntwo daughters, Zeni and Zindzi. The terms of Winnie\u2019s banning order prohibited\nher from entering any educational establishment, so she was always obliged to\ndepend on relatives or friends to help with the children at school. The first\nnursery school which Zeni attended asked her to leave after a few days,\n\n\faccording to Winnie, on instructions from the security police. Both Zeni and\nZindzi were later expelled from a Coloured primary school after the police\nintervened. Eventually, they were taken to schools in Swaziland, where\nMandela\u2019s other three children were being educated.\nThe anguish that Mandela suffered on learning of these events was acute. \u2018To\nsee your family, your children, being persecuted when you are absolutely\nhelpless in jail, that is one of the most bitter experiences, most painful\nexperiences I have had,\u2019 he recalled.\n\nAfter six months of pounding stones in the prison courtyard, Mandela and his\ncolleagues in the isolation section were sent to work in the lime quarry. Each\nmorning they set out on a twenty-minute march towards the centre of the island\nwhere the quarry was sited. Warders made sure they were kept well away from\nall other groups of prisoners, isolating them like lepers. On the way, they passed\nnear the small house where the PAC leader, Robert Sobukwe, was being held in\nrelative comfort but confined to a solitary existence, with no one to talk to other\nthan warders and the occasional visitor he was permitted. He complained to one\nvisitor that he was forgetting how to speak. Occasionally the koeloekoetz group\ncaught a glimpse of him in his garden.\nThe lime quarry was a huge crater carved out of a hillside, blindingly white in\nthe sunlight. There was no shade other than a few tin sheds at the base. The heat\nin summer was stifling; in winter, it became bitterly cold. All day long, with\nonly a break for lunch, the prisoners toiled away with picks and shovels, digging\nout seams of lime from the rock, their faces and bodies covered in white dust,\ntheir eyes aching from the dazzling glare. In the late afternoon, they trudged\nback to the prison cells, exhausted.\nThe glare, in particular, caused them severe problems. \u2018The reflection from\nthe lime catches the sunlight and throws it back on to you and it can be\nextremely sharp and scorching,\u2019 said Maharaj, who spent twelve years on the\nisland. To protect their eyes, the lime quarry prisoners repeatedly put in requests\nfor sunglasses. It took three years before permission was granted and even then\nthe prison authorities made the prisoners pay for the sunglasses themselves.\nFor all the hardship that working in the lime quarry involved, it also provided\nthe prisoners with an opportunity to engage in day-long discussion and debate.\n\n\fWorking in small groups of four or five, they talked endlessly about the politics\nand history of the African struggle for rights, analysing the past in terms of what\nsuccesses and failures had occurred. They had time too to dwell on a whole\nrange of other issues, some serious, some trivial. They debated the merits of\ncircumcision, argued over beauty competitions and spent days trying to sort out\nwhether tigers were indigenous to Africa. Discussions in the quarry became the\nmain event of the day. \u2018The lime quarry was, even at the worst of times, a site\nfor intellectual stimulation,\u2019 recalled Michael Dingake.\nMandela gained the reputation of being a hard taskmaster in these discussions.\nHe gave short shrift to anyone putting up flimsy arguments. Some prisoners\nregarded him as being dogmatic and overbearing. \u2018He can be harsh with\ncolleagues,\u2019 agreed Sisulu, \u2018even with me.\u2019 Writing about his experiences on\nRobben Island, Dingake referred to Mandela\u2019s \u2018direct, fiercely candid approach\u2019\nand recalled arguments with him from which he emerged \u2018bloodied\u2019 and\n\u2018humiliated\u2019. \u2018In argument against someone with insubstantial facts, Nelson can\nbe vicious,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018Very few people like to be cross-examined and exposed\nin their vagueness and ignorance.\u2019\nMandela had no time, added Dingake, for idle chat or gossip. \u2018Every day, but\nevery day,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018he had numerous appointments with individuals, always\non his own initiative, to discuss inter-organizational relations, prisoners\u2019\ncomplaints, joint strategies against prison authorities and general topics.\u2019\nNot all the discussions were amicable. A serious rift developed between\nMandela and Govan Mbeki which resulted in a direct challenge to Mandela\u2019s\nleadership. Mbeki was even more inclined to be dogmatic in argument than\nMandela. A hard, uncompromising communist, intolerant of contrary opinion, he\nclashed with Mandela over the issue of Operation Mayibuye. Mbeki was\nadamant that the plan had been officially approved. Mandela disagreed. The feud\nbetween them opened up a fault line within the small ANC community in the\nisolation section. Mbeki was supported by other hardline communists, including\nRaymond Mhlaba, Joe Gqabi and Andrew Masondo. A fierce row flared up in\nthe quarry between Mandela and Gqabi, who considered himself, after six\nmonths\u2019 training in China, to be better qualified on guerrilla warfare tactics than\nMandela. On one issue after another, the rift widened. An acrimonious dispute\ndeveloped over the relationship between the ANC and the Communist Party,\nwith Mbeki insisting that they were one and the same and Mandela maintaining\nthey were separate entities with the same objectives. At times the feud degen -\n\n\ferated into accusation and counter-accusation. Some inmates were accused of\nbeing ready to abandon the armed struggle; others of fomenting racial hostility.\nA memorandum smuggled out of prison to ANC officials in exile spoke of\n\u2018extreme tension and bitterness\u2019 between Mandela and Mbeki. For several years\nthey were hardly on speaking terms. Eventually the feud was brought formally to\nan end and Mandela\u2019s leadership reaffirmed, but the fault line remained. \u2018It\nresurfaced time after time again,\u2019 said Maharaj.\nThe warders in charge of the lime quarry span differed in deciding how much\ndiscussion to allow prisoners. One warder, known to them as\n\u2018Mazithulele\u2019\u2014\u2018the quiet one\u2019\u2014for his soft-spoken and tolerant manner, usually\npositioned himself at some distance from the group and took a lenient view of\nhow much work they did. He was there on the first day that Michael Dingake\nworked in the lime quarry, shortly after his arrival on Robben Island in .\n\u2018The whole morning I did nothing but give a report to Mandela and Sisulu,\u2019 he\nwrote. \u2018Three of us had our right feet on our spades and conversed. Mazithulele\nsat under a bush and never interfered.\u2019\nHis replacement, however, a warder named van Rensburg, who sported a\nswastika tattoo on his wrist, enforced much harsher discipline. He stood close to\nthe prisoners, constantly shouting at them to work harder and accusing anyone\nhe considered was not exerting himself of \u2018malingering\u2019. All this was\naccompanied by a stream of racial abuse. Van Rensburg issued so many charges\nagainst prisoners that they responded by forming a legal committee, consisting\nof Mandela, Bam and Maharaj, to advise them on how to defend themselves\nbefore the prison\u2019s administrative court. Mandela\u2019s advice was always the same:\nask the court for \u2018further particulars\u2019, a tactic which often had van Rensburg\nstumped.\nEven under van Rensburg\u2019s supervision, the prisoners managed to keep up\ntheir discussions and the work songs that lightened their day. But the risk of\npunishment was never far away. One day, the long-running debate over the\nquestion of tigers in Africa took on political overtones. As tempers ran high,\neveryone stopped working and ignored calls from the warders to get back to\nwork. Finally, van Rensburg marched over and bellowed in English, \u2018You talk\nmuch, but you work too few!\u2019 At which point, the prisoners collapsed in\nlaughter. The upshot was that Mandela and Masondo were taken away in\nhandcuffs for a spell of solitary confinement on a spare diet of rice water.\n\n\fWhen they were first taken to the lime quarry, the prisoners were told that\ntheir work there would last six months. Officials of the International Committee\nof the Red Cross were given regular assurances by the prison authorities that\ndigging at the lime quarry had stopped, but Mandela and other members of the\nRivonia group were to spend thirteen years there.\n\nDuring a tour of inspection of Robben Island in , the Commissioner of\nPrisons, General Steyn, questioned Mandela, in his role as spokesman for the\nisolation section, about prisoners\u2019 requests for study privileges. \u2018What is it you\nwant about things like studies?\u2019 he asked. \u2018What is it you want?\u2019 Mandela at the\ntime was the only prisoner on Robben Island entitled to study; soon after\nentering prison in , he had gained permission to complete his law degree\nwith London University and he had pursued his studies intermittently ever since.\nHis colleagues in the isolation section hoped to gain the same right, even though\nthey were category D prisoners. Replying to the general, Mandela said, \u2018You\nshould let the atmosphere of a university prevail here on the island.\u2019\nThe following year, the prison authorities granted permission to prisoners to\nstudy. They were allowed to register with the University of South Africa for a\ndegree or with the Rapid Results College for secondary school education. Those\nwho had yet to reach secondary-level education were helped by inmate teachers\nlike Neville Alexander. Most prisoners took to the task with enthusiasm, even\nthough it came at the end of a hard day\u2019s work at the quarry. \u2018At night, our cell\nblock seemed more like a study hall than a prison,\u2019 recorded Mandela.\nThe conditions in which prisoners began their studies were primitive. Their\ncells were permanently damp and in winter bitterly cold. They were given\nneither desks nor chairs. After complaints, the prison authorities installed in each\ncell a wooden board attached to walls at chest-height to serve as a makeshift\nstand-up desk. It took six months of more complaints before they were willing to\nprovide wooden stools and to lower the stand-up desks.\nStrict rules were imposed on study activities. Books and periodicals deemed\nunsuitable were banned. In Mandela\u2019s case, study material prescribed by the\nUniversity of London fell victim to the prison censors, making it difficult for\nhim to meet examination standards. Students were not allowed either to lend\nbooks to those who were not students or even to exchange books with prisoners\nstudying the same subject. Students able to afford books they needed were thus\n\n\funable to help those too poor to buy them. Applications for library books were\nalways carefully scrutinized. Warders were often deliberately obstructive,\ndelaying the delivery of mail and books. Students who failed to abide by study\nconditions risked losing the privilege altogether.\nWhile working at the lime quarry, prisoners formed their own study groups.\n\u2018Our economics class was a very lively class,\u2019 wrote Dingake. \u2018Not even van\nRensburg managed to curb the animation of its members. The \u201claymen\u201d in\neconomics stood and watched as we argued noisily over our supply and demand\ncurves and drew them on the ground to demonstrate their gradients and\nelasticity.\u2019 Mandela and Fikile Bam often worked alongside each other in the\nquarry, discussing law.\nMandela also took up the study of Afrikaans and encouraged others to do the\nsame. To those colleagues who argued that Afrikaans was the language of their\noppressor, Mandela replied that it was a vital means of understanding the mind\nof their oppressor, useful in the longer term as well as in prison. It was long-term\npossibilities that Mandela always managed to keep in sight.\nWith the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross, graduate\nprisoners were given permission to teach literacy courses to other prisoners. As\nGovan Mbeki recalled:\nWe took people from the lowest level, who came to the island illiterate. I\nremember one group I had. I started with them when they were illiterate, started\nthem up. And by the time they left Robben Island they were able to write letters\nhome\u2014they didn\u2019t require anybody to write letters for them and to address their\nenvelopes. And they spoke English. Upon completing each stage of their\ncourses, students were issued with certificates headed \u2018The University of\nRobben Island\u2019.\nIn addition to these approved activities, the koeloekoetz men began to develop\ntheir own political education courses. The courses grew out of a series of\ninformal talks on ANC history given at the lime quarry by Sisulu, who was\nrenowned for his encyclopedic knowledge of the organisation. Other lectures\nwere added. Kathrada talked about the Indian struggle for political rights,\nMaharaj expounded on Marxism and Mandela taught a course in political\neconomy. The lectures became part of a course of study known as Syllabus A,\nwhich was spread over two years. When prisoners in the general section heard of\nthe lectures, they asked to become involved. Copies of the lectures were\n\n\fsmuggled out to them.\nUniversity activity became the only real source of stimulation that prisoners\nenjoyed. Many attributed their ability to endure Robben Island to their study\nprivileges. \u2018It is one single thing that really keeps you together,\u2019 said Dikgang\nMoseneke, who graduated with a school-leaving certificate and then went on to\nobtain a degree in political science and English.\nHowever, just as much as study privileges were prized by inmates, so they\nbecame a weapon in the hands of the prison administration, subject to the whims\nof prison officials.\n\nThe kitchens on Robben Island were notorious not just for turning out food that\nwas barely edible but for corruption. They were manned by common-law\nconvicts who ensured that the tastiest foods were kept back for themselves, their\nfriends and the warders who supervised them. The official rations allowed to\nprisoners were meagre enough, but what emerged from the kitchens was even\nless adequate. \u2018Lunch and supper, especially the supper of African prisoners,\nwere sometimes so full of sand and miscellaneous kinds of dirt and insects that\neven the strong stomachs of the most hard-bitten would somersault,\u2019 said Ne ville Alexander. \u2018Hungry people would sometimes leave food uneaten.\u2019\nComplaints about food were commonplace, but nothing was ever done to\nimprove the system.\nA particular grievance of political prisoners was the discrimination the\nauthorities applied between food for Africans and food for Coloureds and\nIndians. African prisoners received what was termed an \u2018F diet\u2019; Coloureds and\nIndians were placed higher on the scale with \u2018D diet\u2019. Both diets were based\nlargely on maize, but D-diet prisoners were given bread and extra helpings of\nmeat, vegetables and coffee. The regulations were quite specific. D-diet\nprisoners, for example, were allowed two ounces of sugar a day; F-diet\nprisoners, one and a half ounces. Sharing food with prisoners with different diets\nwas forbidden and resulted in punishment.\nIt was a shortage of food which in  precipitated the island\u2019s first major\nact of defiance. At the stone quarry, where about  prisoners from the general\nsection were working, food for lunch arrived as usual in half-drums transported\non two wheeled trolleys. When the bell for lunch rang, the prisoners formed\n\n\fqueues, with Coloured and Indian prisoners in front and Africans behind,\nwaiting patiently while a common-law convict doled out food on plates set out in\nlong rows, starting with Coloured and Indian plates and moving on to the\nAfrican ones. No one was allowed to take a plate until all the food had been laid\nout.\nThe food ran out. About  plates stood empty. The usual rou - tine when\nthis happened was for warders to send prisoners back to the kitchens for more\nfood, but on this occasion the warder in charge of the quarry span, a large redfaced man named Delport, universally hated as a \u2018slave-driver\u2019, gave the order to\nreduce the F-diet rations already doled out. When two prisoners stepped forward\nto protest, Delport told them, \u2018You either take your food or leave it.\u2019 Though Ddiet prisoners at the front of the queue were not affected, they decided to refuse\ntheir food. One by one, prisoners filed past the plates without taking them.\nIn the afternoon, they resumed work in the quarry having had nothing to eat,\nthen trudged back to the prison and again refused their food. In hurried\ndiscussions, ANC, PAC and other prisoners agreed to continue the hunger strike\nfor as long as possible in protest not just against food rations but against all the\nother grievances they had raised\u2014over working conditions, arbitrary\npunishment, beatings and other malicious treatment meted out by warders. There\nwere fears that the prison authorities might retaliate by ordering mass assaults.\nNo one was sure what the outcome would be, but the prevailing view among\nprisoners in the general section was that the time had come to take a stand. The\nwarders, meanwhile, remained confident that the strike would soon collapse.\nIt was not until the second day of the strike that Mandela and others in the\nisolation section heard of what was happening. A note wrapped in plastic telling\nthem a hunger strike was under way arrived in their food drum but gave no\ndetails. Mandela was sceptical about the value of hunger strikes, arguing that\nthey tended to harm prisoners more than the authorities. He favoured work\nstrikes or go-slow action instead. But on hearing the news, he and others readily\nagreed to join. When prisoners in the general section in turn learned of\nMandela\u2019s involvement, their spirits revived.\nEach day, the prison authorities produced ever more appetizing food, steaming\nhot, laced with vegetables and soaked in fat. But still the resolve of prisoners, in\nboth the general and the isolation sections, held firm. Even the sick and elderly\ninsisted on taking part. Patients in hospital who refused food were turned out of\n\n\ftheir beds and told they would have to work in the quarry. In a pathetic straggle,\nthey stumbled along the road, some in bandages, some crawling, accompanied\nby a warder shouting, \u2018No food\u2014no medicine.\u2019\nBy the fifth day of the strike, the prisoners were beginning to flag. The\njourney to the quarry, normally half an hour, took an hour. The hospital group\nhobbled along several hours later. Work in the quarry tailed off. Prisoners started\nto collapse. In the afternoon, the hospital group was taken back to the prison\ncompound in a van.\nOn the sixth day, prisoners sat around listlessly in the quarry, not even\npretending to work. Nobody had the energy even to speak. Those who collapsed\nwere carted away in wheelbarrows. But just when it seemed to the survivors that\nthey could endure no more, a senior officer arrived and, after a few taunts, asked\nwhat their complaints were. Everyone began to shout at once. A deputation of\nprisoners was organised to present their case at a meeting with prison officials.\nThe officials duly promised to investigate all the complaints the prisoners raised.\nFor a few days, a more lenient regime prevailed on Robben Island. The food\nimproved, the warders were more restrained and there were fewer beatings. It\nwas not long, however, before the prison administration took its revenge. Some\nsixteen prisoners deemed to be ringleaders of the strike were sentenced to an\nextra six months\u2019 imprisonment. The improvements turned out to be temporary\nas the old methods soon returned. Yet the atmosphere on the island was never\nquite the same as it had been before. The prisoners regarded the strike as a\nsuccess. They had defied the administration and survived.\n\nAs the number of ANC prisoners on Robben Island rose month by month,\nreaching about , by , Mandela and his colleagues devised ways and\nmeans of setting up their own forms of organisation to maintain internal\ndiscipline and control, and to circumvent the authorities. An elaborate network\nof committees was established\u2014disciplinary, political, educational, literary,\nrecreational\u2014to deal with every aspect of prisoners\u2019 lives and to keep open\nchannels of communication between different sections. At the apex was a\ncommittee known as the High Organ, consisting of four members of the old\nnational executive: Mandela, Sisulu, Mbeki and Mhlaba. Mandela served as its\nhead.\n\n\fEvery opportunity was used to keep the leaders in the isolation section in\ntouch with the mass of prisoners in the general section. Messages were hidden in\ndrums of food, in toilets, which the warders rarely searched, or in matchboxes\ndiscarded by warders on their way to the quarries and surreptitiously picked up\nby prisoners. The prison hospital was a regular contact point to exchange\ninformation. The penalties for being caught in possession of messages or any\nillicit piece of paper were severe: messengers risked a prolonged spell in solitary\nconfinement or the loss of study privileges. The danger from searches carried out\nby warders or from tip-offs by informers was ever-present. But despite the\nhazards, the communications system functioned effectively enough.\nA perpetual war was also conducted over the possession of newspapers.\nPrisoners were always desperate for news of the outside world. \u2018Newspapers are\nmore valuable to political prisoners than gold or diamonds, more hungered for\nthan food or tobacco,\u2019 wrote Mandela. \u2018They were the most precious contraband\non Robben Island.\u2019 The prison authorities equally relentlessly endeavoured to\nprevent prisoners gaining access to newspapers. Raids in search of newspapers\nwere commonplace.\nDespite the risks, prisoners stole newspapers from careless warders, bribed\ncorrupt ones, retrieved them from rubbish dumps and took them surreptitiously\nfrom visiting doctors and priests. Every scrap of newspaper, whether it had been\nused to wrap warders\u2019 sandwiches or for toilet purposes, was seized upon. Old\nnewspapers were as valued as recent ones. Each item, however trivial, was\nmemorised or copied, passed on and talked about for days. The disposal of\nnewspapers, torn into minute shreds and flushed down toilets, took hours. Some\ncuttings ended up being eaten.\nIn the isolation section, Kathrada was given the task of organising\ncommunications and newspaper distribution. To minimise the risk, he first took\ncuttings, then handed them on to other prisoners to make short summaries which\nwere then passed down the line. But there were frequent casualties. Mandela was\nonce caught in his cell reading a newspaper which a warder had inadvertently\nleft lying on a bench at the end of the corridor and which had so engrossed him\nhe failed to hear the footsteps of an approaching officer. It cost him three days in\nisolation on a diet of rice water.\nPrisoners also had some success in managing to talk individual warders into\nadopting a more tolerant regime. As a matter of policy, the ANC\u2019s High Organ\n\n\ftook the view that warders who accorded fair treatment to prisoners should be\nrespected in return and that others should be encouraged to act similarly. The\nresults were usually worthwhile. Mandela recalled:\nWe soon became aware that in terms of our daily lives a warder in our section,\nan ordinary warder, not a sergeant, could be more important to us than the\ncommissioner of prisons or even the minister of justice. If you went to the\ncommissioner of prisons or even the minister of justice and said, \u2018Sir, it\u2019s very\ncold, I want four blankets,\u2019 he would look at the regulations and say, \u2018You can\nonly have three blankets . . . more would be a violation of the regulations and if I\ngive you four blankets I\u2019ll have to give others four blankets.\u2019 If you went to a\nwarder in your section and said, \u2018Look, I want an extra blanket,\u2019 and if you\ntreated him with respect, he\u2019d just go to the storeroom, give you an extra blanket\nand that\u2019s the end of it. If you said, \u2018Can I have some gravy today from the\nkitchen,\u2019 he just went to the kitchen and got you gravy.\nMandela developed cordial relationships with a number of indi - vidual\nwarders. \u2018With junior officers who knew their position, Nelson was charming\nand fatherly,\u2019 Dingake recalled. \u2018Many young warders were friendly to him,\noccasionally soliciting advice from him in connection with their jobs or social\nproblems.\u2019 With senior officers, with whom he was frequently at odds over\nprison practices, his relationship was far more abrasive.\nPrisoners were particularly effective in encouraging warders, often poorly\neducated, to study, like them, hoping it would bring a more enlightened\napproach to their prison duties. More and more warders turned to graduate\nprisoners to help them with their courses. \u2018Eventually, we ended up teaching\nthem subjects like history, maths, English and even Afrikaans,\u2019 said Neville\nAlexander.\nOn occasion, they resorted to blackmail. An elderly warder on night duty in\nthe isolation section whom Maharaj had befriended asked him one night for help\nwith writing an essay for a newspaper competition he wanted to enter. Maharaj\nagreed. Two weeks later the warder asked for more help; he had reached the\nfinal round, needed to produce another essay and offered Maharaj a cooked\nchicken in return. After consulting Mandela and Sisulu, Maharaj agreed to write\nthe essay in exchange for a packet of cigarettes. The warder duly handed one\nover. Once Maharaj had the packet of cigarettes with the warder\u2019s fingerprints\non it, he threatened to expose him to the prison authorities unless he allowed him\n\n\fto borrow his newspaper each night. The warder, fearful of losing his job and\npension, duly obliged. For three hours every night, Maharaj transcribed items\nfrom the newspaper, handing it back before the warders changed shift, and then\npassed his work on to other prisoners to copy so that nothing could be traced\nback to him. This nightly transaction went on for six months until the warder\nwas transferred.\nThe struggle for improvements in conditions, meanwhile, slowly began to\nshow results. In , the authorities allowed prisoners in the general section to\nstart playing football on Saturday mornings. Football and other outdoor sports\nlike rugby and cricket became the mainstay of long, dreary weekends when\nprisoners were otherwise kept locked up in cells. Within months, the Makana\nFootball Association on Robben Island boasted some twenty-six sides in three\ndivisions. Training was carried out in cells during weekdays. \u2018Sport was very\nimportant on the island,\u2019 said Steve Tshwete, an ANC prisoner. \u2018It relieved the\ntension and anxiety about family, about home and about survival in prison\nitself.\u2019\nPrisoners in the isolation section were excluded from participating in generalsection sports; nor were they permitted to attend as spectators. For a time they\nmanaged to get a view of football matches by peering through the tops of\nwindows in the isolation section facing the pitch. Mandela\u2019s voice could be\nheard booming out, \u2018Good move, well played!\u2019 But the authorities soon put a\nstop to that by painting over the windows. The only relief to the monotony of\nweekends in the early years, apart from brief exercise periods, came from the\nvisits of priests on Sundays. For the first two years, prisoners were confined to\ntheir cells while the priest preached from the head of the corridor, but during the\nthird year services were conducted in the courtyard outside, allowing inmates to\nbask in the sun.\nA notable boost to morale was provided by a visit in  by Helen Suzman,\nthe only member of parliament to take an interest in the welfare of political\nprisoners. Before her arrival, the warders moved Mandela out of his customary\ncell, no. , which was close to the entrance of the corridor, to no. , at the end\nof it, in the hope that by the time Suzman reached him, she might have little time\nleft to speak to him. But this ploy was quickly thwarted when Suzman stopped at\nthe first cell and was told by Eddie Daniels not to waste time talking to him but\nto go straight to the end of the corridor to talk to Mandela.\n\n\fMandela put his hand through the bars of the cell door and said, \u2018How do you\ndo, Mrs Suzman, I\u2019m very pleased to meet you.\u2019 Suzman was struck by his\nremarkable degree of self-assurance. With both the commissioner of prisons and\nthe commanding officer of Robben Island standing close by, Mandela proceeded\nto list grievances over food, clothing, study facilities, labour conditions and the\nharsh treatment meted out by warders, singling out by name van Rensburg, the\nwarder with the swastika tattoo, for whom he harboured an abiding hatred.\nSuzman promised to take up all these issues with the minister of justice.\nIn a subsequent meeting with the minister, when she threatened to expose van\nRensburg\u2019s conduct in parliament, the minister hastily agreed to his removal.\nThe prisoners had struck back and won. But it was to be another seven years\nbefore Suzman was given permission to return to Robben Island.\n\n",
    "1967-1973": " \fCHAPTER \n\nA DOUBLE ORDEAL\nHOWEVER MUCH MANDELA LOOKED FORWARD TO VISITS FROM\nHIS family, they were occasions tinged as much by sadness as by joy. In , a\nfamily group of four visited him: his mother, Nosekeni, his son Makgatho, his\ndaughter Makaziwe and his favourite sister, Mabel. He had not seen the children\nfor more than five years; they were now teenagers and had grown up without\nhim. His mother he had last seen across the courtroom in Pretoria on the day in\n that he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Because they had all travelled\nsuch a distance, his mother coming from the Transkei, the prison authorities\nextended the visiting time allowed from thirty to forty-five minutes.\nHis oldest son, Thembi, did not join them, even though he was living nearby\nin Cape Town at the time. Thembi never visited his father on Robben Island. The\nbitterness that he felt at the break-up of his parents\u2019 marriage never left him. As\na boy of ten, he had become withdrawn and silent. Sisulu, who took an\navuncular interest in him, once remarked to Mandela, \u2018Man, that chap is quiet.\u2019\nAt school in Swaziland, he had fallen in love with a young girl, Thoko, who\nbecame pregnant and was obliged to return to her home in Cape Town. Thembi\nfollowed her there, finding a job as a clerk. Their first child, a daughter, was\nfollowed by a second daughter\u2014Mandela\u2019s first grandchildren. But though\nRobben Island could be seen across the water from Cape Town, Thembi made\nno effort to go there.\nMandela\u2019s mother appeared to him to have aged considerably. She had lost\nmuch weight. \u2018When she left I looked at her walking out and I had the feeling I\nhad seen her for the last time,\u2019 he recalled. Several weeks later, after he had\nreturned from a gruelling day in the lime quarry, a warder with whom he had\nbecome friendly, James Gregory, handed him a telegram. It was from Makgatho,\ntelling him that his mother had died of a heart attack. He sought permission from\nthe authorities to attend her funeral in the Transkei, but was refused.\nIn the following months, he pondered much over the life of his mother, an\n\n\funschooled woman, widowed at an early age and bewildered by his commitment\nto politics rather than his family. He felt troubled by how little he had done to\nhelp her. \u2018Her difficulties, her poverty, made me question once again whether I\nhad taken the right path,\u2019 he wrote in his autobiography. \u2018That was always the\nconundrum: had I made the right choice in putting the people\u2019s welfare even\nbefore that of my own family?\u2019\nAn even more painful blow came the following year when another telegram\narrived from Makgatho, this time saying that Thembi had been killed in a car\naccident. The news was again conveyed by James Gregory, who recalled the\nmoment in his autobiography:\nIn his eyes I could see the sternness I was to recognize when he struggled to\nmaintain self-control. It was a distancing from me and from others, and in some\nways his face receded into a fixed expression, tight lines around his mouth.\nThose lines always went deeper the more worried, sad or angry he became. At\nthat time, he simply said, \u2018Thank you, Mr Gregory,\u2019 and walked away.\nMandela was devastated. He returned to his cell and stood before the barred\nwindow looking out. He did not emerge for dinner. Eventually Sisulu went to\nsee him, and stayed with him, holding his hand. A night warder reported that\nthroughout the night he stood before the window, staring out, not moving. The\nnext morning, he wrote a request asking to be allowed to attend the funeral. His\nrequest was denied.\nMandela\u2019s anguish over the persecution of Winnie also intensified at this time.\nIn May , in the middle of the night, the security police arrested Winnie at\nher home in Orlando, detaining her under the new Terrorism Act, which enabled\nthem to imprison her without charge and without any access to legal\nrepresentation, in solitary confinement, indefinitely.\nThe two Mandela daughters, Zenani, aged ten, and Zindzi, aged nine, were at\nhome at the time, on holiday from school in Swaziland, and watched as their\nmother was taken away. They were sent to stay with one of Winnie\u2019s sisters. On\nRobben Island, the prison authorities made sure that Mandela knew of Winnie\u2019s\narrest by leaving newspaper cuttings in his cell.\nWinnie\u2019s arrest was part of a round-up of several hundred dissidents whom\nthe security police wanted out of the way. In an amateurish fashion, Winnie had\ntried her hand at underground political activity, exposing both herself and others\nto considerable risk. She acquired a duplicating machine on which to run off\n\n\fANC pamphlets and news-letters sent from abroad and accepted an offer from\nher friend Maude Katzellenbogen to keep it in a room in her house, safe from\npolice raids, not suspecting Katzellenbogen\u2019s motives. She also used\nKatzellenbogen\u2019s address as a mail drop for letters from abroad sent to cover\nnames. She was later to discover that the police had detailed information about\nthe pamphlets and the cover names.\nWinnie also became increasingly involved with an employee of the United\nStates Information Agency, Mohale Mahanyele, asking him first to act as her\ndriver, then introducing him to clandestine ANC meetings and eventually\npersuading him to allow her to use USIA offices for reproducing ANC\npamphlets on duplicating machines at weekends and as an address for overseas\nmail. She talked to Mahanyele endlessly about the need for black liberation, but\nwhenever he asked what steps needed to be taken, her reply was always the\nsame: force, she would say, the overthrow of the government. So much time did\nMahanyele spend with Winnie that his irate wife threatened to tell everything to\nthe police. Meanwhile, Mahanyele\u2019s employers had become suspicious about the\namount of foreign mail he was receiving.\nWinnie\u2019s imprisonment had a marked effect on her character. She was taken\nto Pretoria Central Prison and placed in a solitary confinement cell, five feet\nwide and ten feet long. The bedding she was given consisted of a sisal mat and\nthree blankets filthy from months of use without being washed. The only other\nitems she was allowed were a toilet bucket, a plastic bottle of water and a mug.\nThe smell from the toilet bucket was terrible. A single light bulb burned all night\nlong. The only time she was allowed out of the cell was for brief exercise\nperiods. She had no access to a bath or shower.\nAfter two weeks, she was taken to be interrogated. Her chief interrogator was\nSwanepoel, now a major, notorious for his brutal methods. For five days and\nnights she was questioned over and over again, one interrogator following\nanother. Their purpose was not so much to find out what she knew, for, as\nWinnie soon realised, they were already well informed about her meetings, her\npamphlets and her address lists. What they wanted to do was to break her spirit,\nto turn her into a collaborator. They presented her with statements from men\nwho said they had slept with her. They told her of how other prisoners under\ninterrogation had betrayed her. They offered to release her if she cooperated. On\nthe sixth day, utterly exhausted and suffering from fainting fits and heart\npalpitations, she capitulated, confessing to everything her interrogators\n\n\fdemanded.\nBack in her cell, Winnie was then subjected to months of solitary\nconfinement. The only contact she had was with white warders, who treated her\nmaliciously. Every day she was required to strip off her clothes for inspection.\nShe was given a Bible to read, but otherwise there was nothing to occupy her.\nShe started to talk to herself. She spent hours unthreading a blanket, then\nweaving it into threads. The food she was given was so foul she began to suffer\nfrom malnutrition. Two months after her arrest, Swanepoel walked into her cell\nand asked her who Thembi Mandela was. When she replied that he was her\nstepson, Swanepoel told her curtly, \u2018Well, he is dead. He was killed in a car\naccident\u2019, and then left. Winnie broke down and wept. There were times in\nsolitary confinement when she hovered on the borders of insanity.\nIt was not until after she had spent nearly six months in prison that the\ngovernment produced any charges against her. In October , she was one of\na group of twenty-two defendants accused of offences under the Suppression of\nCommunism Act. The others included four women who had also been held in\nsolitary confinement, one of whom, Rita Nzanga, had been savagely assaulted\nduring interrogation.\nOn the first day of their appearance in the Pretoria magistrates\u2019 court, there\nwas some confusion about who was to act as their legal representative. When\nWinnie was arrested in May, her relatives had turned for help to Joel Carlson, a\ncivil rights lawyer well known to Mandela and highly respected by political\nactivists. But for several months, the security police had been engaged in an\nelaborate ploy to ensure that Winnie was not represented by Carlson. Maude\nKatzellenbogen was used to spread rumours discrediting him. Her partner,\nMoosa Dinath, who had been involved in the scheme to free Mandela from\nJohannesburg\u2019s Fort prison, was sent to Robben Island in July to try to persuade\nMandela to let another lawyer, Mendel Levin, represent Winnie instead of\nCarlson. Mandela turned down the suggestion. But Winnie, in solitary\nconfinement, fell for it, agreeing not only to give Levin a power of attorney but\nto write a letter to political colleagues in London saying that Carlson was not to\nbe trusted.\nBoth Levin and Carlson appeared in court, Levin announcing that he was\nacting as Winnie\u2019s legal representative, Carlson admitting that he was not clear\nof his status but determined if possible not to let the security police win the day.\n\n\fThe matter was decided when the magistrate agreed to adjourn the case to give\nthe defendants an opportunity to consult with their relatives. Winnie\u2019s sisters,\nwho were in court, had received a message from Mandela on Robben Island\ninsisting that no one other than Carlson should be allowed to represent Winnie\nand were now able to advise her of the fact. Levin was duly obliged to withdraw.\nThe indictments against Winnie and the other accused, several of them trade\nunionists, were largely of a minor nature. They were accused of attempting to\nrevive the ANC by organising meetings, distributing banned literature, recruiting\nmembers and staging funeral rallies. Mohale Mahanyele was produced as a chief\nwitness. The government had hoped to portray their activities as part of a\ndangerous communist conspiracy against the state and, with the help of a\ncompliant defence lawyer, gain a notable victory in court. But the defence team\nassembled by Carlson, which included George Bizos and Arthur Chaskalson,\nsoon turned the trial to their own advantage by winkling out the fact that no less\nthan five state witnesses had agreed to give evidence only after they had been\nsubjected to police torture. To avoid further embarrassment, the government\nabruptly announced in February  that it was withdrawing the charges.\nWinnie\u2019s ordeal, however, was not over. Along with other defendants, she\nwas immediately re-detained and taken back into solitary confinement, in the\nhands once again of vengeful white warders. In June, the government brought\nnew charges against her and the others, this time under the Terrorism Act.\nWinnie did not attend the court hearing, as she was in the prison hospital\nsuffering from malnutrition. When the trial opened in September, their defence\ncounsel, Sydney Kentridge, called for an acquittal, pointing out that the charges\nthe accused faced under the Terrorism Act were virtually identical to the ones\nthey had faced under the Suppression of Communism Act which had resulted in\ntheir acquittal. The judge duly acquitted them.\nAfter  days in prison, Winnie was finally free to go home. But within two\nweeks, she was served with a new five-year banning order, restricting her to\nOrlando West, prohibiting her from receiving visitors at home and placing her\nunder house arrest each night and during weekends. The restriction order was\nlifted briefly in November, when she was allowed to visit Mandela on Robben\nIsland for the first time in two years\u2014for thirty minutes.\nMandela had been tormented by Winnie\u2019s imprisonment. He later described it\nas a desperately distressing experience, more difficult to contend with than\n\n\fanything else he had known in prison. He spent sleepless nights worrying about\nher plight, worrying too about who was looking after his daughters, who was\npaying the bills at home.\nThe impact on Winnie herself, by the time she emerged from prison, was\nindelible. Recalling the experience some twenty years later, she remarked, \u2018It is\nin fact what changed me; what brutalised me so much that I knew what it is to\nhate.\u2019\n\nThe atmosphere on Robben Island deteriorated markedly in . A new prison\ncommander, Colonel Piet Badenhorst, was appointed at the end of the year to\nenforce a tougher regime and to stamp out all signs of prisoner resistance. He\nhad a reputation for being one of the most ruthless and authoritarian officers in\nthe prison service, feared alike by prisoners and by warders. Renowned for his\nincessant use of foul and abusive language, he brought with him a team of handpicked warders eager to do his bidding, one of whom became known as \u2018The\nDevil\u2019. Badenhorst himself was given the name Kid Ruction.\nMandela had made a practice of asking for an interview with all new prison\ncommanders, but Badenhorst ignored him. Two weeks after he arrived on the\nisland, Badenhorst put in an appearance at the lime quarry to find little work\nunder way there. A group of koeloekoetz men were standing about trying to\nexplain to one of the new warders the work norms that prevailed at the quarry.\nBadenhorst singled out Mandela: \u2018Mandela, jy moet jou vinger uit jou gat trek,\u2019\nhe shouted\u2014\u2018Mandela, pull your finger out of your arse.\u2019 Then he drove away.\nWithin minutes, a truck was sent to pick up the prisoners. They were taken\nback to the isolation section and paraded before Badenhorst. Swearing profusely,\nhe accused sixteen prisoners of refusing to work and summarily demoted all of\nthem to the next lowest grade of classification, so that those who had reached C\ngrade and gained study privileges were demoted to D grade and instantly lost\ntheir ability to study. The effect on prisoners was devastating, but their protests\nwere to no avail.\nThe prison\u2019s legal procedures, which prisoners had been able to exploit to\ntheir advantage, were suspended. Every decision, every punishment, now came\nat the whim of warders without explanation or recourse to prison courts. \u2018For\nevery imaginable triviality, real or pretended, the prisoner would be marched off\n\n\fto the office by a warder who would give a verbal \u201creport\u201d, duly distorted or\ninvented, and the prisoner would be marched back to his cell, usually without\nbeing asked to explain his \u201cconduct\u201d or to comment on the \u201creport\u201d,\u2019 re - corded\nNeville Alexander. This arbitrary system of dispensing punishments caused\nmassive resentment. \u2018Except for the brutality of assaults,\u2019 wrote Alexander, \u2018no\nother facet of life and experience on Robben Island caused so much bitterness.\u2019\nSome prisoners were sent to the \u2018segregation section\u2019\u2014in effect, into solitary\nconfinement\u2014for periods lasting as long as six months.\nCell raids and body searches in the cells became more frequent and more\naggressive. Increasingly rigorous censorship was applied to reading material and\nto letters. Outgoing letters were confiscated, recreation facilities were drastically\ncurtailed and food rations were cut.\nIn May , in response to a hunger strike started by some Namibian\nprisoners which other prisoners joined, Badenhorst let loose his warders on a\nnight rampage through the prison. Several Namibians were savagely beaten. The\nisolation section was raided by warders armed with batons, screaming and\nshouting. On a bitterly cold winter\u2019s night, prisoners were kept standing naked\nfor an hour while their cells were searched. \u2018They stripped me and told me to put\nmy hands against the wall,\u2019 recalled Sisulu. \u2018I was worried because I had flu. I\nthought that their plan might be that I become ill and eventually die.\u2019 Mbeki,\nwho was also ill, suffered severe chest pains and collapsed. All complaints were\nignored.\nThe following year, when three judges made a tour of Robben Island,\naccompanied both by the commissioner of prisons, General Steyn, and by\nBadenhorst, Mandela was asked to act as a spokesman for the prisoners. The\njudges suggested that he might prefer to speak to them in private, but Mandela\nreplied that he would rather speak in front of the prison officials so that they\ncould have an opportunity to respond to his criticisms. He related the incident of\nthe beatings that had taken place in the general section and how the matter had\nsub - sequently been covered up. When he had finished, Badenhorst intervened\nto ask aggressively whether he had witnessed the beatings. Mandela replied that\nhe had not, but trusted the account that had been given to him. Wagging his\nfinger in Mandela\u2019s face, Badenhorst retorted, \u2018Be careful, Mandela. If you talk\nabout things you haven\u2019t seen, you will get yourself into trouble. You know\nwhat I mean?\u2019\n\n\fIgnoring Badenhorst, Mandela turned to the judges and said, \u2018Gentlemen, you\ncan see for yourself the type of man we are dealing with as commanding officer.\nIf he can threaten me here, in your presence, you can imagine what he does\nwhen you are not here.\u2019\nThree months later, Badenhorst was transferred from Robben Island.\n\nA more benign regime followed Badenhorst\u2019s departure. In , prisoners\nregained the right to legal representation. By court order, they could no longer be\narbitrarily demoted or deprived of meals or placed in solitary confinement. Study\nprivileges were restored, though many obstacles to study remained. Their living\nconditions also improved. From , prisoners\u2019 bedding consisted of two sisal\nmats, a felt mat and five blankets. They were entitled to two sets of clothing and\ngiven underwear for the first time. Hot water was provided. Political prisoners\ngained access to the kitchens for the first time, ensuring a fairer distribution of\nfood. Though food for African prisoners was still graded differently, prisoners\nwere allowed to pool their food. Medical treatment improved. Prisoners were\npermitted to travel to the mainland for dental visits or for specialist hospital\ntreatment. The numbers of letters and visitors allowed to prisoners were\nincreased. Category D prisoners, restricted to one letter and one visit every six\nmonths in , were now permitted one letter and one visit every month.\nPhotos of family members and friends, once banned, were now allowed. Both\nletters and photos were shared with fellow prisoners and often circulated for\nseveral months before being returned to their owners. The censors, however, still\nacted with a heavy hand, sometimes reducing a letter to a mere greeting\n\u2014\u2018Darling husband\u2019\u2014and sometimes withholding it altogether. Photos were\nsubject to censorship. Mandela asked Winnie to send him a photo of Oliver\nTambo, but it was prohibited.\nRecreational facilities were extended. Tennis courts were built for prisoners in\nthe general section. In the isolation section, part of the courtyard was turned into\na volleyball court. Table tennis was the most popular pastime in prison. Indoor\ngames, like draughts, chess and bridge, also flourished. Films were shown once a\nfortnight. Musical instruments were allowed. Records were played over the\nintercom system for three hours every morning and at weekends. In the general\nsection, prisoners formed a band, consisting of saxophone, trumpet, clarinet,\nflutes, harmonicas, guitars and penny whistles. Choral singing was performed to\n\n\fsuch a high standard that even warders were known to listen.\nAt Christmas time, the prison authorities allowed prisoners to stage a concert\nand a play and to hold competitions. The food remained the same, but prisoners\nwere given an extra mug of coffee for supper and entitled to purchase a small\nquantity of sweets. It was the one day of the year, said Mandela, when the prison\nauthorities showed any goodwill towards men.\n\nMandela\u2019s routine, after ten years of his life sentence, was as disciplined and\npurposeful as he could make it. He woke early, often long before the first bell\nwas sounded at : a.m. He started the day with a burst of physical exercise,\nrunning on the spot for up to forty-five minutes and performing as many as \nfingertip push-ups,  sit-ups and fifty deep knee-bends. Once his cell door was\nopened at : a.m. and he had dispensed with the tasks of tidying his cell and\ncleaning his toilet bucket, he jogged around the cement courtyard, clad in shorts,\nT-shirt and running shoes, before heading to an exercise hall for some skipping\nand shadow-boxing. He also took his turn scrubbing and polishing the floors and\ncleaning the toilets of B Section along with everyone else. Vigorous exercise he\nalways found helpful to reduce tension. When a flu epidemic hit the isolation\nsection in , Mandela, who was spared the outbreak, made the rounds each\nmorning collecting the toilet buckets of his sick colleagues, emptying them,\ncleaning them and then returning them to the cells.\nAfter breakfast, eaten sitting at a long communal bench with other prisoners,\nhe fell in for the journey to the lime quarry, passing through the prison gates,\ntaking off his cap at each one on the order to do so. The regime at the quarry was\nrelatively lenient. Much of Mandela\u2019s time was spent in giving lectures,\nparticipating in debates and listening to the discussions of fellow inmates.\nThough he was sometimes harsh and dogmatic in debate, he was also\nacknowledged to be a good listener, always eager to draw his colleagues into\ndiscussion and quick to understand the points they were making. He preferred to\nexamine issues by hearing differing viewpoints, then reaching a conclusion, in a\nmanner that he had first witnessed as a boy at the Great Place at Mqhekezweni.\nHis grasp of detail and his memory for it were put to good use. \u2018His capacity to\nretain what he hears made him an excellent reporter after interviews with\nauthorities,\u2019 wrote Dingake. \u2018He could be detailed not only in the substance of\nthe point made, but in reporting expressions and innuendoes of the participants.\u2019\n\n\fThe lime quarry routine was changed in  when the koeloekoetz group\nwere given alternative work occasionally collecting seaweed, wading into the\nsea, lining it up in strips on the beach and loading it into the back of a truck for\nuse eventually as fertilizer. In winter, it was bitterly cold work, but Mandela\nmuch preferred it. From the shore, he could see the skyscrapers of Cape Town in\nthe distance and watch the shipping move to and fro from the harbour. Seaweed\nduties also gave prisoners the opportunity to cook themselves delicious seafood\nstews for lunch and to collect shells and pieces of coral to decorate their cells.\nReturning to the prison at  p.m. for a shower and supper, Mandela was\nlocked up in his cell for the rest of the night by  p.m. He used the time for study\nand writing letters. He also surreptitiously undertook legal work for prisoners in\nthe general section who wanted help preparing judicial appeals. As an A-grade\nprisoner, he was entitled to three outgoing and three incoming letters each\nmonth, as well as two half-hour visits of two people at a time each month.\nHis cell, seven feet square, had taken on a more homely appearance. As a\nresult of high blood pressure, from which he had suffered for more than ten\nyears, in  Mandela was provided with a bed; and because of back problems,\nhe was given a chair instead of a bench. On a bookshelf stood a picture of\nWinnie which he would dust affectionately each day, rubbing his nose against\nhers.\nWeekends were spent either in the confines of the courtyard or in the cells.\nMandela devoted considerable time to trying to improve relations between the\nANC and the PAC, seeking out PAC leaders in the isolation section, believing\nthat if the two organisations could settle their differences on Robben Island, that\nmight provide a basis for national reconciliation. Both the ANC and PAC\nparticipated in a prisoners\u2019 committee known as Ulundi which represented all\ngroups in the isolation section. But every other attempt at producing a united\nfront proved fruitless.\nOn Sundays, Mandela attended church services of whatever denomination had\nbeen chosen for the day, listening with equal attention to the sermons by\nCatholic, Hindu, Muslim and Dutch Reformed Church priests who visited the\nisland. Though brought up in the Methodist Church and still regarding himself as\na staunch member, he favoured a broad attitude towards religion. The priest\nwhom Mandela most appreciated and who always gained the largest\ncongregation was an Anglican minister named Father Hughes, a burly\n\n\fWelshman who endeavoured to lace his sermons with titbits of news and words\nof encouragement. One of his favourite quotations was: \u2018I groused and groused\nbecause I had no shoes until I saw a man who had no feet.\u2019 Father Hughes\nbrought with him a portable organ with which he accompanied the prisoners,\npraising them for their singing. During Kid Ruction\u2019s regime, the portable organ\nwas prohibited. Mandela took holy communion on a regular basis: \u2018The\nsacrament gave me a sense of inner quiet and calm.\u2019 But he spoke of himself as\nnot being particularly religious or spiritual: \u2018I am just an ordinary person\ninterested in trying to make sense of the mysteries of life.\u2019\nFor relaxation, Mandela enjoyed playing draughts, competing each year in the\ndraughts competition and occasionally winning it. His style of play was slow and\ndeliberate, with each move considered carefully. Once a fortnight he watched a\nfilm show in the isolation section, though he tended to become bored with the\nmediocre selection of films on offer.\nHis favourite occupation, though, was gardening. He had acquired a love of\ngardening and growing vegetables during his schooldays at Clarkebury, working\nin the garden belonging to the principal, Reverend Harris. Soon after arriving on\nRobben Island, he had asked the authorities for permission to start a garden in\nthe courtyard, but it had taken years for them to agree. Given a narrow patch of\nearth alongside a perimeter wall, he worked assiduously to nurture plants in the\ndry, stony soil, studying horticultural techniques from library books, and he took\nimmense satisfaction in the resulting tomatoes and onions he produced.\nThe highlight of Mandela\u2019s routine was the arrival of a letter or a visitor from\nhis family, especially Winnie. She was the focus of his emotions. Without a\nletter from Winnie, he said, he felt as dry as the desert. A letter from her was like\nthe coming of the summer rains. His own letters in return were full of love and\naffection and a deep longing for her presence. He constantly referred to\nmemories of their time together, of touching her hand, hugging her, tasting the\ndelicious dishes she cooked, and of the hours they had spent in the bedroom.\nOn the occasions when they met in the visiting room, separated by a panel of\nthick glass, Winnie was always careful to dress with flair, knowing that he\nwould cherish the details for weeks to come. Each time, he said, he felt like\nlingering in the room after she had gone to savour the moment a little longer but\nforced himself to leave lest emotion overtook him. His next letter would be full\nof compliments about her dress and about the effect her beauty had on him.\n\n\fWinnie was also the focus of his main concern. There seemed to be no respite\nfrom the harassment the security police meted out to her, nor to her propensity\nfor becoming entangled with police informers and other dubious characters. In\n, she was charged with violating her banning order when her sister, Beauty,\ncame to her house with her husband, two children and brother-in-law to pick up\na shopping list. She was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment, but on appeal\nthe sentence was suspended and the conviction was eventually overturned. In\n, she was again charged with violating her banning order, this time after a\nfamily friend, the photographer Peter Magubane, also a banned person, was\nfound by police hiding under her bed. She was sentenced to twelve months\u2019\nimprisonment, but once again on appeal the sentence and conviction were set\naside. Interspersed with all this, Winnie faced random police raids, some\nmysterious gunshots and a night when she awoke to find three intruders in her\nhouse.\nThen, in , she was again accused of violating her banning order, this time\nwhen Peter Magubane brought her daughters, Zeni and Zindzi, who were on\nholiday from school in Swaziland, to meet her for lunch near her place of work.\nSentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment, she appealed but won only a reduction in\nher sentence to six months. In September , therefore, she was back in\nprison, serving her time in Kroonstad in the company of two other political\nprisoners.\nNews about Winnie that reached Mandela on Robben Island always seemed to\ninvolve controversy and trouble. In , one month after her last visit to\nRobben Island, Winnie sent Mandela a message saying that her request for\nanother visit had been turned down on the grounds that Mandela himself did not\nwant to see her. Mandela immediately made an appointment to see the head of\nprison, Lieutenant Prins, to lodge a protest. After Mandela had explained the\nmatter, Prins responded rudely, \u2018Ag, Mandela, your wife is only seeking\npublicity.\u2019 He then went on to make a remark so offensive about Winnie that\nMandela lost his temper, shook his fists and let loose a torrent of abuse. It was\none of the rare occasions on Robben Island when Mandela lost his self-control.\nWhen charges were brought against him, Mandela prepared counter-charges.\nThe case was subsequently dropped.\nMandela was also concerned about his children. Makgatho had turned into a\nfeckless character. Expelled from school for involvement in a student strike, he\nhad left without passing matriculation and failed subsequent attempts to do so.\n\n\fHe had since married and fathered a son. Once or twice a year he went to\nRobben Island to see Mandela, on one occasion arriving there drunk. Mandela\nconstantly urged him to return to his studies and Makgatho made promises, but\nhe never fulfilled them.\nMakaziwe had shown greater aptitude at school, becoming the first of\nMandela\u2019s children to pass matriculation, but to his deep disappointment, instead\nof proceeding to university, she had decided to get married. Mandela tried to\npersuade her to postpone marriage until after she graduated, but she would not\nlisten. She had two children in quick succession, then the marriage failed.\nMandela\u2019s other two daughters, Zeni and Zindzi, had been tossed about in the\nturmoil of Winnie\u2019s own life. Both had been deeply affected by the succession of\nraids, arrests, imprisonments and dark dramas that beset their mother. Only\nschool in Swaziland and the help of good friends in Johannesburg had provided\na source of stability. Of the two, Zindzi had adapted most readily to the hurlyburly surrounding Winnie. At the age of twelve, after witnessing police break\ndown the door of their house in Orlando West during the  Christmas\nholidays, she wrote an appeal to the United Nations Special Committee on\nApartheid, asking for help in providing protection for Winnie:\nHardly a month goes by without the newspapers reporting some incident\nconcerning Mummy, and her friends and family feel that the public is being\nconditioned to expect something terrible to happen to her. I know my father,\nwho is imprisoned for life on Robben Island, is extremely concerned about my\nmother\u2019s safety, and has done everything in his power to appeal to the\ngovernment to give her protection, but without success.\nBecause of prison regulations, Mandela never set eyes on either of his\ndaughters until , when Zeni was sixteen and Zindzi was fifteen. He was by\nthen virtually unknown to them, a man familiar only through old photographs.\nFor their first visits, he took particular care with his appearance, anxious to\ncreate a favourable impression. It was a nervous moment for all of them. Trying\nto put the girls at ease, Mandela gestured towards the warders surrounding him\nin the cubicle, saying, \u2018Have you met my guard of honour?\u2019\nZindzi recalled:\nI had heard so much about my father that I was rather apprehensive about seeing\nhim for the first time. He was more a great figure than a father. But when we\nmet, even through the glass partition and speaking on telephones, I found it very\n\n\feasy. He is so versatile and charismatic that in just a few minutes he seemed to\nchange the whole atmosphere. The warders were breathing down our necks all\nthe time, but he put me at my ease at once, recalling little incidents from the time\nwhen I was a baby.\nThat same year, Mandela embarked upon the writing of his memoirs, hoping\nthat they might be published to coincide with his sixtieth birthday in . He\nworked mainly at night, sleeping during the day, having informed the prison\nauthorities that he was unwell and would not be going to the quarry. Each bit of\nwork was passed on to Sisulu and Kathrada for comments, which they jotted\ndown in the margins. The manuscript was then handed to another colleague,\nLaloo Chiba, who produced a copy of it in microscopic shorthand. The plan was\nfor Mac Maharaj to smuggle the copy out of prison when his twelve-year\nsentence came to an end in . The original manuscript, meanwhile, would be\nburied at a spot in the courtyard, to be dug up and destroyed once Maharaj\u2019s\ncopy was safely out of the country.\nIn four months, Mandela completed  pages. Because it was too bulky to\nbury in one spot, the manuscript was divided into three, each part wrapped in\nplastic, placed in a tin container and then hidden in a separate hole in the ground\nat one end of the courtyard.\nBut the plan went awry a few weeks later when, unexpectedly, a team of\nprison labourers arrived in the isolation section to dig a trench for the\nfoundations for a new wall in the same area of the courtyard. Mandela managed\nto retrieve two of the packages and to destroy them, but the third was discovered.\nThe punishment for Mandela, and for Sisulu and Kathrada, whose handwriting\nwas also on the manuscript, was severe. All three were stripped of their study\nprivileges for four years.\nThe routine on Robben Island, meanwhile, continued relentlessly, week after\nweek, month after month. Then, in June , the atmosphere deteriorated\ndramatically. Returning to the prison compound, tired and dirty after a day\ncollecting seaweed in bitterly cold conditions, the prisoners rushed to the\nshowers to find that there was no hot water. On following days, even when the\nrain and the cold made work almost impossible, they were forced outside again.\nAttempts to negotiate with the authorities proved fruitless. There was a rare\ndisagreement between Mandela and Sisulu about what form their response\nshould take. What neither knew at the time was that an eruption of political\n\n\fviolence had occurred in South Africa, sending tremors across the country, with\neffects that reached even the sequestered world of Robben Island.\n SOWETO\nWHITE SOCIETY, DURING THE FOURTEEN YEARS THAT MANDELA\nHAD spent in prison, had become increasingly prosperous and secure.\nThroughout the s, South Africa experienced one of the highest rates of\neconomic growth in the world, second only to that of Japan. Foreign trade with\nWestern countries rose by leaps and bounds. Foreign investors from the United\nStates, Britain, France and Germany competed vigorously for positions in new\nindustries. The annual net flow of foreign capital into the country in  rose to\na level six times higher than that of the pre-Sharpeville era. The economic boom\nalso brought to South Africa a flood of white immigrants, mainly from Europe:\nbetween  and  there was a net gain of some ,. All this gave\nwhite South Africans a growing sense of confidence about the future. Black\nresistance had been crushed and the security apparatus seemed capable of\nmeeting any contingency. Many whites believed the apartheid system to be\ninvincible.\nThe benefits of National Party rule were noticeable particularly among the\nAfrikaner community. With government assistance, a new class of Afrikaner\nfinanciers, businessmen and managers had moved into commanding positions in\nindustry, commerce and banking, areas once the preserve of English-speaking\nwhites. State enterprises like railways, harbours, steel production, electric power\ngeneration and heavy engineering were manned at a senior level almost\nexclusively by Afrikaners and used as training fields for Afrikaner scientists and\nbusiness leaders. Government contracts and concessions were frequently steered\ntowards Afrikaner companies. The civil service was virtually an Afrikaner\npreserve. Afrikaner farmers, consisting of three-quarters of the total number,\nalso fared well under National Party rule, assisted by subsidies, research funds,\nmodernisation programmes and favourable prices fixed by state marketing\nboards.\nThe Afrikaner working class prospered as never before. By , more than\n per cent of the Afrikaner population were living in towns and cities. White\n\n\fjobs were given whatever protection was needed from black competition.\nAlmost every skilled trade and craft was reserved for white workers. When\nunskilled whites felt threatened by black competition, the government made use\nof legislation it had introduced in the s, enabling it to reserve any\noccupation for whites only. Some orders applied to entire industries, like\nproduction jobs for the clothing, building, metallurgical and mining industries.\nOthers affected only small, specific areas protecting a handful of employees, like\nthe jobs of traffic policemen in Cape Town and passenger-lift operators in\nJohannesburg. At a more general level, white workers were protected by two\ncardinal principles the government used to determine its labour policy: first, no\nwhite worker could be replaced by a black worker in the same job, and second,\nno white worker could work under a black.\nThe English-speaking community, of course, shared in the prosperity; few\nother communities in the world possessed such a high standard of living. The\nnorthern suburbs of Johannesburg, where many English-speakers congregated,\nwere said to have the greatest concentration of swimming pools outside Beverly\nHills. Whatever reservations English speakers might have held about the nature\nof National Party rule, the success it enjoyed made them compliant citizens.\nThe system seemed strong enough to withstand any shock. When Hendrik\nVerwoerd, the driving force behind grand apartheid, was assassinated in the\nNational Assembly by a deranged parliamentary messenger in , the white\ncommunity took the prime minister\u2019s death in its stride. No shift in policy was\nconsidered necessary. Verwoerd\u2019s successor, chosen by the National Party, was\nJohn Vorster, who, as minister of justice, had made such a success of smashing\nblack opposition. Immediately upon being elected, Vorster declared, \u2018My role is\nto walk further along the road set by Hendrik Verwoerd.\u2019\nThe impact of grand apartheid on the African population was felt with\ndramatic force during the s as the government worked systematically to\nstem the flow of Africans from rural to urban areas and to destroy all notion that\nurban Africans could have a permanent place in \u2018white\u2019 towns. With remorseless\nvigour, the government strove to reduce the urban African population wherever\npossible, stripping urban Africans of what few rights they possessed and ridding\nwhite rural areas of vast numbers of blacks. A government circular in \nstated: \u2018No stone is to be left unturned to achieve the settlement in the\nhomelands of non-productive Bantu at present residing in the European areas. \u2019\nAmong those whom the circular defined as \u2018non-productive\u2019 were \u2018the aged, the\n\n\funfit, widows and women with dependent children\u2019. A government minister\nestimated that of  million Africans in white areas,  million were \u2018surplus\nappendages\u2019 suitable for deportation to black homelands.\nAs the policy took effect, the number of prosecutions under pass laws rose\nsharply, reaching , in . Countless thousands found themselves\n\u2018endorsed out\u2019 of urban areas. In the Transvaal and the Orange Free State,\nmassive urban relocation programmes were carried out. African townships\nconsidered to be within commuting distance of a homeland were \u2018deproclaimed\u2019\nand their residents moved to new rural townships built in the homelands. In\nsome cases, the entire African population was moved, as happened at Nelspruit\nand Lichtenburg. In other cases, government officials concentrated on removing\nthe unemployed, the elderly and disabled, women and children, leaving behind\nAfrican workers to live in all-male hostels and visit their families on a weekly or\nmonthly basis.\nIn place of a stable, urban population, what the government wanted was a\nworkforce composed principally of migrant labour. With migrant workers\ncirculating continuously between black homelands and white-owned enterprises\nin urban areas, the government saw a means of reconciling the white need for\nlabour with its own determination to prevent permanent black urbanisation.\nAfrican workers could be turned into commuters if they lived in homelands close\nenough to urban areas, or weekly migrants if the distance was too far.\nAlternatively, African workers could be engaged in the traditional manner on\nannual contracts, housed in all-male compounds and released to visit their\nfamilies in the homelands at the end of the year. In , it was estimated that\nmore than  million men spent their lives circulating as migrants between their\nhomes and urban employment. Many of them were deprived of all normal family\nand social life, confined for months on end to a bleak and barren existence in\novercrowded barracks that were notorious for high rates of drunkenness and\nviolence. Others spent hours each day travelling long distances to work in\npacked buses and trains, rising before dawn and returning home late into the\nnight.\nBlack townships were deliberately kept as unattractive as possible. Few urban\namenities were ever provided. Black businessmen were prevented by\ngovernment restrictions from expanding their enterprises there. No African was\nallowed to carry on more than one business. Businesses were confined to\nproviding \u2018daily essential necessities\u2019, like wood, coal, milk and vegetables.\n\n\fThere could be no banks or clothing stores or supermarkets. Restrictions were\neven placed on dry-cleaners, garages and petrol stations. Nor were Africans\nallowed to establish companies or partnerships in urban areas, or to construct\ntheir own buildings. These had to be built and leased from the local authority.\nThe largest urban area in the country, Johannesburg\u2019s South Western\nTownships, which included Mandela\u2019s home district of Orlando, was typical of\nthe bleak urban landscape enforced by the government. Known from  as\nSoweto, it consisted mainly of row upon row of identical four-room brick\n\u2018matchbox\u2019 houses with hardly any public facilities. Only a small proportion of\nhouses had electricity or adequate plumbing. There were few paved roads or\nproper pavements, no modern shopping centres or office blocks, and not a single\npharmacy or bakery. Because of restrictions placed on African trading rights,\nthree-quarters of the groceries consumed by Sowetans were purchased in white\nshops in Johannesburg. More than  million people lived there in circumstances\nwhich became increasingly cramped. From the mid-s, the construction of\nfamily housing in all urban areas virtually came to a halt. Priority was given\ninstead to building housing in the homelands and hostels in urban areas for\nmigrant labour. By , the average number of people living in each house in\nSoweto had risen to thirteen. By , the housing backlog was even greater\nthan it had been in the s.\nThe effect of apartheid in rural areas was equally severe. Leaving \u2018no stone\nunturned\u2019 in its drive for racial separation, the government began to excise\nscores of African settlements surrounded by white farming areas where Africans\nhad lived in relative peace and quiet for generations. In the government\u2019s\nterminology, these settlements were known as \u2018black spots\u2019, small fragments of\nland in what was deemed to be \u2018white\u2019 South Africa which stood out as irritating\nblemishes on the apartheid map. Some land was held by title deed, purchased by\nAfrican farmers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; some was\nmission land scheduled for African use under the Natives Land Act of ,\nsmall African reserves which had survived intact the era of white occupation but\nwhich were now considered to be \u2018badly situated\u2019. In all, there were an estimated\n black spots.\nThe elimination of black spots began in earnest in the s. Whole\ncommunities were uprooted and forced to leave their homes. Many were dumped\nin areas often unsuitable for cultivation, lacking water supplies, far from main\nroads and out of reach of hospitals or clinics. Any sign of resistance was dealt\n\n\fwith by armed police. A Franciscan priest, Father Cosmas Desmond, who made\na journey the length and breadth of South Africa to ascertain the full extent of\nthe forced removals policy in , later described how he found a \u2018laby - rinth\nof broken communities, broken families and broken lives\u2019. Between  and\n, nearly , Africans lost their homes during the elimination of black\nspots. Many more were to follow.\nIn white farming areas, where the white population was constantly\npreoccupied with die beswarting van die platteland\u2014the blackening of the white\ncountryside\u2014the government acted with similar vigour to reduce the black\npopulation. White farmers were encouraged to adopt more mechanised\nproduction methods and to replace permanent black workers with casual\nemployees and single migrant workers. An estimated half a million full-time\nblack workers lost their employment on white farms during the s.\nThousands of African labour tenants\u2014\u2018squatters\u2019\u2014were also turned off white\nland. The only Africans whom the government wanted in white farming areas\nwere hired labourers, preferably migrants.\nThe impact of all these changes in \u2018white\u2019 South Africa on black homelands\nwas devastating. Already overcrowded and impoverished, homelands had to\ncope with an endless flow of displaced Africans\u2014labour tenants, squatters,\nredundant farm labourers, urban dwellers\u2014\u2018superfluous\u2019 people, as they were\ndescribed, all scrabbling for survival. During the s, the homeland\npopulation nearly doubled. Once in the homelands, most African men had no\nalternative but to offer themselves up to the migrant labour treadmill. The\ngovernment, for its part, pronounced itself well pleased with the results of its\npolicy. \u2018The elimination of the redundant non-economically active Bantu\u2019 in\nwhite areas, said a government minister in , was \u2018a tremendous\nachievement\u2019.\n\nFor ten years, while the apartheid system bit ever deeper into the lives of the\nAfrican population, little sign of protest emerged. The repression used to crush\nUmkhonto we Sizwe had made an impact too deep to be forgotten easily. Even\ntraditionally militant areas like the townships of the Eastern Cape were cowed\ninto silence.\nBut in the early s, a new generation of black activists arose from the\nranks of the student population. It was a generation which drew its inspiration\n\n\fnot from the concept of multiracial struggle that the ANC had championed but\nfrom a sense of black assertiveness more in line with the Africanist tradition of\nblack politics. The black consciousness movement of the s filled the\nvacuum left by the collapse of the ANC and the PAC. It found an articulate\nspokesman in Steve Biko, a medical student from the Eastern Cape, who argued\nthat \u2018group power\u2019 would achieve black liberation. Biko was contemptuous of\nthe cowed and submissive attitude of the black population. \u2018The type of black\nman we have today has lost his manhood,\u2019 he wrote in a student newsletter in\n. \u2018Reduced to an obliging shell, he looks with awe at the white power\nstructure and accepts what he regards as the \u201cinevitable position\u201d.\u2019 What was\nneeded, said Biko, was a massive effort to reverse the negative image that blacks\nheld of themselves and to replace it with a more positive identity. Black\noppression was first and foremost a psychological problem. It could be\ncountered by promoting black awareness, black pride, black capabilities and\nblack achievement. The term \u2018black\u2019 was used to include Coloureds and Indians\nequally with Africans as victims of racial oppression. No help was wanted from\nwhite liberals or any other white sympathisers. The slogan used was: \u2018Black\nman, you are on your own.\u2019\nAs the black consciousness movement gathered momentum, it found outlets in\nliterature, poetry, music, theology and in local community projects promoting\neducation, health and welfare. A host of youth clubs, discussion groups and\ncultural organisations sprang into existence.\nThe stirring of black discontent eventually prompted the government to take\nreprisals. In  it issued banning orders on Biko and seven other leaders of the\nmovement. But its actions failed to prevent the spread of black consciousness. A\ndramatic boost to black morale occurred in  when Portuguese rule in\nMozambique and Angola collapsed, paving the way for African liberation\nmovements there to take control. When South African troops were obliged to\nwithdraw from Angola in early , having failed to prevent a Marxist guerrilla\norganisation from gaining power there, black students again celebrated the\ndefeat of white power.\nThe issue that finally ignited student anger was the system of Bantu education\ndesigned by Verwoerd to limit African education to the needs of the white\neconomy. It had produced a legacy of inferior schooling, poorly trained teachers,\novercrowded classrooms and inadequate equipment. Government expenditure\nhad been kept to a minimum: in the early s it spent sixteen times more on\n\n\fwhite education per pupil than on black education. Because of deliberate\nrestrictions on places in middle and higher schools, hundreds of thousands of\nchildren\u2014\u2018push-outs\u2019, as they were known\u2014left school with no greater\nprospects than menial work or unemployment. Those who managed to complete\nsecondary school were faced with a whole range of apartheid restrictions\naffecting the kind of employment for which they could apply.\nInto this potentially explosive atmosphere the government stumbled with yet\nanother regulation. In , it decided that an old ruling, originally made in\n, that half of the subjects in secondary schools not taught in the African\nvernacular had to be taught in Afrikaans and the other half in English should be\nenforced the following year. Because of the practical difficulties involved, the\nruling had hitherto been ignored. African teachers in training college continued\nto receive their instructions almost exclusively in English. Many teachers were\nunable even to converse in Afrikaans. In one protest after another, teachers\u2019\norganisations, school boards, principals and parents sought to persuade the\ngovernment to change its mind, but the government remained adamant.\nThe epicentre of the resistance was Soweto. Students, denouncing Afrikaans\nas the language of the \u2018oppressor\u2019, began to boycott classes in Afrikaans,\norganised school strikes and then planned a mass dem - onstration. On  June\n, a dozen columns of students marched through Soweto carrying placards,\nchanting slogans and singing freedom songs. They were met by armed police\nwho opened fire, killing a thirteen-year-old schoolboy. As news of the shooting\nspread, students went on the rampage, attacking government buildings, beer\nhalls, bottle stores, vehicles and buses. Two whites were killed. For three days,\nSoweto was the scene of running battles between groups of students and riot\npolice in armoured convoys, often firing indiscriminately. Clashes spread to\nother townships in the Transvaal. At least  people were killed during the first\nweek of the Soweto revolt, most of them black schoolchildren.\nIn July, the government retreated on the Afrikaans issue. But by then the\nstudents had set their sights on bringing down the whole Bantu education\nsystem. Some believed that the government itself could be toppled. Time and\nagain they returned to the streets, showing remarkable resilience in the face of\npolice firepower and displaying a level of defiance and hatred of the apartheid\nsystem rarely seen before. As soon as one set of student leaders was detained or\ndis - appeared into exile, others stepped forward, ready to take their place.\n\n\fYet for all the courage shown, the student revolt lacked any sense of direction.\nMarches, demonstrations and arson attacks produced little discernible result\nother than an endless series of police raids and a high cost in casualties\u2014at least\n dead and , wounded. From September onwards the momentum of the\nrevolt began to ebb. By December it had virtually died out.\n\nThe prison population on Robben Island had undergone several changes over the\nyears. When Mandela was first sent there in  it consisted mainly of\nhardened criminals divided into rival gangs which constantly fought each other\nfor ascendancy. Murder, assault and sodomy were commonplace. There\nfollowed an influx of PAC prisoners, many on short sentences of two or three\nyears. ANC prisoners, at first a small minority, eventually outnumbered them. In\nthe early s, the criminal population was steadily reduced. The number of\npolitical prisoners also fell as those on short sentences departed. By the mids, political prisoners numbered only , many of them middle-aged or\ngrowing old, long accustomed to a prison routine which they themselves had\ndone much to shape.\nThe arrival in  of young, unruly black consciousness activists, as\ndetermined to confront the prison system as they had been to confront the\napartheid system outside, shook the prison to its core. They regarded the settled\nhabits of the older inmates, in particular their willingness to conform to prison\nregulations, with contempt, as being little different from the submissive attitude\nto authority shown by their parents and teachers for so many years. Normal rules\nlike standing up in the presence of prison officers and taking off their caps were\nsimply ignored.\nSuch conduct came as a shock to the older generation of prisoners. In his\nautobiography, Mandela described an incident he witnessed in which a prison\nofficer told a newly arrived prisoner to take off his cap. \u2018What for?\u2019 retorted the\nprisoner. Mandela recalled, \u2018I could hardly believe what I had heard.\u2019 The young\nmilitants were prepared neither to submit to prison discipline nor to heed the\nadvice of old stalwarts on how best to handle the prison authorities. They\nconsidered conditions on Robben Island to be barbaric and cared nothing for\nexplanations about how much they had improved as a result of the efforts of the\nfirst political prisoners to arrive there.\nMost of the  intake were placed in a new part of the prison known as\n\n\fSection E. But several prominent activists, including two Indians, Strini\nMoodley and Saths Cooper, were sent to the isolation section. Mandela made a\npoint of catching up with the ideas behind black consciousness. But the gulf in\nattitude remained. After watching a documentary on an American motorcycle\ngang known as Hell\u2019s Angels which depicted them as being reckless and violent,\nwhile portraying the police as being decent and trustworthy, the ANC prisoners\nwere all harshly critical of the bikers for their lawlessness. But Moodley\ncompared their rebelliousness to the rebelliousness of the Soweto students and\naccused the ANC men of being elderly middle-class intellectuals who favoured\nright-wing authority.\nBoth the ANC and the PAC expended considerable energy in trying to recruit\nblack-consciousness supporters to their side. The friction this caused lasted for\nseveral years and resulted in serious bouts of violence. In , Mosiuoa Lekota,\na black-consciousness leader who decided to join the ANC, was attacked with a\ngarden fork by former comrades. After leaving Robben Island, Saths Cooper\nobserved caustically, \u2018When the sordidness of prison behaviour is examined,\nthere is little difference between common-law and political prisoners generally.\nWhere the former are often organized into deadly rival gangs, the latter are\norganized into often warring political groupings.\u2019 It was a struggle in which the\nANC\u2019s older generation of prisoners was largely successful in winning over\nblack-consciousness activists.\nMeanwhile, the tempo of life on Robben Island changed in other ways. In\n, the authorities ended hard labour in the quarries, which had been\nMandela\u2019s principal occupation for thirteen years. From , political prisoners\nwere allowed to listen to censored newscasts broadcast over an intercom system.\nFrom , they could buy newspapers and periodicals, albeit heavily censored\nbeforehand by prison staff. A tennis court was constructed in the courtyard.\nMandela\u2019s days were now spent largely at leisure. Most of the time he\noccupied by reading. \u2018He would read for hour after hour in unbroken\nconcentration,\u2019 recalled Kathrada. Because of the four-year ban on his studies,\nthe books he read were mainly novels obtained from the prison library. He\nsubscribed to a wide range of newspapers and periodicals, including Afrikaans\npublications. He kept up his correspondence as regularly as he was permitted,\nworked diligently on legal briefs for fellow prisoners, played tennis and tended\nhis garden patch.\n\n\fFor all the new comforts of prison life, Mandela worried that it was leaving\nhim further and further behind as the outside world moved on. The arrival of the\n activists was a reminder not just of how much he was out of touch with\npolitical developments, with new ideas and thinking, but of how much time had\npassed. Most of the new prisoners had been mere infants at the time his prison\nlife had begun.\nThe departure of close friends added to his sense of being stranded. Fikile\nBam and Neville Alexander had gone in  after serving ten years. Mac\nMaharaj left in , taking with him Mandela\u2019s manuscript. Eddie Daniels\nwent in  and Michael Dingake in . The Rivonia group remained, with\nnot the slightest sign that they would ever be released.\nEach year brought news of the death of old colleagues. Albert Luthuli, in poor\nhealth and with failing eyesight, had died in , struck by a train while taking\na walk near his home in Natal. In , Z. K. Matthews, Mandela\u2019s old\nprofessor, had died in the United States. J. B. Marks died in Moscow in ,\nRobert Resha in London in , Moses Kotane in Moscow in  and\nMichael Harmel in Prague in . Bram Fischer died in , suffering from\ncancer and released from Pretoria prison for only the last few weeks of his life.\nRobert Sobukwe, who had been released from solitary confinement after six\nyears on Robben Island, died in Kimberley in . In a letter of condolence to\nRobert Resha\u2019s widow, Mandela remarked, \u2018It seems that the old and stable\nworld we knew so well is beginning to crumble down, leaving us with nothing\nbut painful memories.\u2019\n\nAs a resident of Soweto, Winnie was drawn swiftly into the tumult of the student\nuprising. She played a leading role in the Black Parents Association, formed by a\ngroup of local leaders to act as intermediaries between the students and the\nauthorities. The BPA helped organise funerals and raised money for medical and\nburial expenses. Winnie herself renewed her reputation for militant behaviour\nwhen she went to a local police station in the company of an African bishop and\nended up by shouting and throwing objects at the police, accusing them of\nmurder. \u2018There was the usual flare-up,\u2019 she said. \u2018I don\u2019t think Bishop Buthelezi\nhad ever seen anything like that in his life. I wanted to restrain myself because of\nhim but it was difficult.\u2019 One of her BPA colleagues, Dr Nthatho Motlana, a\nclose friend of the Mandelas who acted as guardian to Zeni and to Zindzi,\n\n\frecalled how Winnie\u2019s conduct would scare them: \u2018Often I would say, you are\nbloody foolhardy, you are going to get us all locked up, and when they\nthreatened to lock her up she just said, \u201cDo it, man!\u2019\u201d\nIn August , Winnie and ten other women were detained under the\nInternal Security Act and taken to the Fort. She remained there, without being\ncharged, for five months. During the school holidays, Zeni and Zindzi went to\nstay in Johannesburg with the banned activist Helen Joseph and visited their\nmother each week, taking fruit, clothes and newspapers. Released at Christmas,\nWinnie was once more issued with strict banning orders, confining her to her\nhouse in Orlando between  p.m. and  a.m. each day.\nAs the first anniversary of the student uprising drew near, the government\ndevised yet another form of punishment for Winnie: banishment. In May ,\nwithout warning, armed police arrived at her home in the early morning, took\nher to a local police station and piled all her furniture and belongings into a\ntruck. She was then driven  miles to a barren township on the edge of a small\nplatteland dorp in the Orange Free State called Brandfort and prohibited from\ntravelling outside the locality. Zindzi went with her.\nThe house she was given\u2014no. \u2014possessed neither water nor electricity. It\nconsisted of three tiny rooms, far too small for all her possessions, most of which\nhad to be taken away to be stored at the local police station. When she arrived,\nthe floors were covered with mounds of earth left behind by local builders. The\nlocal population had been told that Winnie was a dangerous criminal and\ninstructed to avoid her. She spoke neither of the two languages used locally,\nSesotho and Afrikaans. Under the terms of her banning order, she was confined\nto the house every night and allowed no visitors; during the day, she was\nforbidden to be in the company of more than one person at a time. Her\nmovements were constantly watched. Her neighbours on both sides were\npolicemen. Every day a security policeman kept her under surveillance, spending\nmost of his time in a car parked on a low hill nearby and using binoculars.\nFriends in Johannesburg were quick to help, driving down to Brandfort with\nsupplies of groceries, cosmetics and household items. But they too were\nsubjected to police harassment. After four white women friends were given\nprison sentences for refusing to make statements to police about their visits to\nWinnie, the number of visitors from Johannesburg declined sharply.\nAt shops in the white section of Brandfort, Winnie faced open hostility from\n\n\fstaff. Brandfort was a typical rural settlement, with a few shops on either side of\nthe road, a petrol station, a post office, a railway station, two small hotels, two\nchurches, two banks, an Afrikaans school and a police station, and had been long\naccustomed to a quiet routine and an orderly existence. Blacks who came to shop\nin Brandfort were usually dealt with by being served through separate small\nwindows. When Winnie took Zindzi to a clothes shop to buy her a black\nmourning dress to mark the first anniversary of the Soweto revolt in June, she\nwas confronted by an angry white shop assistant who tried to prevent her from\nentering. The common practice was for blacks to stand outside the shop and\npoint to the clothes that interested them. Winnie\u2019s altercation with the shop\nassistant eventually required the police to break it up. At other shops, when staff\ncomplained about her presence or asked her to go to the non-white section, she\nexploded, shouting and swearing at them.\nThe persistent attention of the police affected not only Winnie but Zindzi too.\nFriends who visited her were questioned aggressively about their meetings.\nSometimes they were prevented from meeting her at all. Only sixteen years old,\nshe fell into a deep depression, weeping continuously and unable to sleep. From\nRobben Island, Mandela brought an urgent application for an interdict against\nthe security police to restrain them from intimidating or harassing Zindzi. In a\nstatement to the court, Zindzi described how the police had burst into the house\nwhile she was in the company of her teenage friends, demanding names and\naddresses, issuing threats and evicting everyone present, then calling on them in\ntheir homes and detaining them for questioning. As a result, she said, her friends\nwere terrified of visiting her. The court ruled that Zindzi was entitled to receive\nvisitors in peace, even though Winnie was subject to a banning order.\nThe atmosphere in Brandfort remained grim, but Winnie was loath to let\nZindzi go back to Johannesburg. \u2018I literally couldn\u2019t let her out of my clutches,\nclinging to perhaps the last semblance of a family unit,\u2019 she said in her\nautobiography. When, after two years in Brandfort, Zindzi did return to\nJohannesburg, to stay with Helen Joseph, Winnie described in a letter to a friend\nhow her daughter\u2019s company had helped cushion her from the pain of exile and\nspoke of the loneliness that followed her departure: \u2018The empty long days drag\non, one like the other. . . . The solitude is deadly.\u2019\nMandela found Winnie\u2019s plight all the more difficult to bear since he knew\nnothing about Brandfort or the surroundings in which she found herself. Apart\nfrom brief glimpses through blurred glass in the visitor\u2019s room and letters\n\n\fcarefully written to avoid censorship, his connection with Winnie\u2019s life, which\nhe cherished so much, was based above all on shared memories of people and\nplaces that were once familiar to him. However bleak the circumstances, he\ncould always picture Winnie at their house in Orlando, cooking in the kitchen,\nreading in the lounge or waking up in the bedroom. But house no. , the\nLocation, Brandfort, was as alien to him as it was to Winnie. It was two years\nbefore he saw a photograph of it.\nAmid the gloom about Winnie, there were some more cheerful items of family\nnews. In  a collection of poetry which Zindzi had written as a young\nteenager, long before her days in Brandfort, was published in the United States,\ntogether with photographs by Peter Magubane. Zindzi dedicated the book to her\nparents. She also wrote an article for the magazine True Love. Mandela was\nhighly impressed by her abilities and hoped writing might become her\nprofession.\nBut it was Zeni who occasioned one of the most memorable days of\nMandela\u2019s prison life. In , at the age of eighteen and eight months pregnant,\nZeni had married Prince Thumbumuzi, a son of King Sobhuza of Swaziland\nwhom she had met while at school there. Neither Mandela nor Winnie was in\nfavour of the marriage at first. Both considered Zeni far too young and wanted\nher first to complete her secondary education and preferably to obtain a\nuniversity degree before settling down to marriage. Mandela asked George\nBizos, his friend and legal adviser, to interview the prince on his behalf. Bizos\nreported favourably and the marriage duly proceeded.\nThe following year, a few weeks before Mandela\u2019 s sixtieth birthday, Zeni\nbrought her husband and her baby daughter to Robben Island. Because she was a\nmember of the royal family of Swaziland, with diplomatic status, she was\naccorded the privilege of meeting Mandela in a room usually used for legal\nconsultations. As Zeni entered the room, she gave the child to her husband and\nrushed to Mandela, hugging him tightly. Then Mandela took the baby and sat\nholding her for the rest of the visit. It was his first experience of normal human\ncontact with his family since his imprisonment.\n\nWhatever signs of black discontent there were, the government pressed on with\nits policies of grand apartheid as determinedly as before and found willing\naccomplices among the black population to make them work. The key figure\n\n\fwas Mandela\u2019s kinsman, Kaizer Ma-tan zima. Since the s, Matanzima had\nproved to be apartheid\u2019s most dependable ally, steering the Transkei towards\nself-government, overcoming whatever opposition stood in his way and laying\nthe foundations for a personal dictatorship which ministers in Pretoria were only\ntoo content to support.\nThe Transkei\u2019s first general election in , in which Matanzima stood as a\nchampion of separate development while his opponents advocated a multiracial\nfuture both for the Transkei and for South Africa, resulted in a clear rejection of\napartheid. Three out of every four candidates elected favoured a multiracial\nsolution. But by relying on the support of chiefs, whom he had previously\nensured were entrenched as a permanent majority in the legislative assembly,\nMatanzima succeeded in obtaining his own election as chief minister. He then\nproceeded to claim that he had a mandate to implement separate development\npolicies. \u2018The people of the Transkei,\u2019 he told the assembly, \u2018have, through the\nballot box, expressed their uncompromising rejection of the policy of\nmultiracialism.\u2019 One of the ministers in his new government was Winnie\u2019s\nfather, Columbus Madikizela.\nAfter thirteen years of controlling public resources and patronage, using his\nchiefly connections and in the last resort locking up his leading opponents,\nMatanzima succeeded at his fourth election in  in capturing seventy-one of\nseventy-five seats. He then used his election victory to claim that it constituted a\nmandate to launch Transkei as an independent state. Independence for the\nhomelands had become the ultimate goal of apartheid\u2019s architects, the final\nsolution for the African population. By bestowing independence on all ten\nhomelands, the government would finally remove all claim that the African\npopulation had to South African citizenship. It would also provide proof to the\ninternational community, so officials in Pretoria believed, that the South African\ngovernment had fulfilled its obligations to provide full rights to the African\npopulation.\nIn October , the Transkei was duly pronounced to be an independent\nstate. Overnight, . million Xhosas living there and . million Xhosas living in\n\u2018white\u2019 areas lost their South African citizenship. Ministers in Pretoria\nannounced that South Africa was henceforth a country of  million people, as\nopposed to  million beforehand.\nOther homelands followed suit. In , Bophuthatswana, the homeland of\n\n\fthe Tswana people, consisting of nineteen major pieces of land spread across\nthree of South Africa\u2019s provinces, was made independent, despite evident\nopposition; in all some . million Tswana lost their South African citizenship.\nIn , Venda opted for independence, even though the chief minister had lost\nan election on the issue. In , Ciskei\u2019s leader decided to accept Pretoria\u2019s\noffer, ignoring the advice of a distinguished panel of experts and an adverse\nopinion survey. Foreign governments took the view that independence for the\nhomelands was nothing more than a device to perpetuate white supremacy and\nwithheld all recognition. Pretoria was nevertheless jubilant. \u2018If our policy is\ntaken to its full logical conclusion as far as the black people are concerned, there\nwill not be one black man with South African citizenship,\u2019 declared a\ngovernment minister.\nFor an elite group of African politicians, chiefs, civil servants and traders,\nself-government and independence brought substantial rewards. Cabinet\nministers, members of legislative assemblies and civil servants gained\nincreasingly from high salaries, loans, land and housing, as the South African\nauthorities sought to establish a prosperous middle class which would underpin\nthe homelands system.\nThe Pretoria government tried to entice Mandela into the process. In , the\nminister of prisons, James Kruger, arranged to meet Mandela on Robben Island\nand offered to remit his life sentence on condition that he recognised the\nTranskei authorities and agreed to settle there as a Transkei citizen. Several\nsubsequent offers were made, but Mandela turned them all down.\nMatanzima also made attempts to see Mandela on Robben Island, but his\napproaches too were rejected. Yet though they remained political adversaries,\nfamily business continued. Matanzima played a prominent role in the\narrangements leading up to Zeni\u2019s wedding and he was instrumental in\npersuading the South African authorities to allow Winnie to attend. He also\nhelped Mandela\u2019s first wife, Evelyn, take over a trading store in Cofimvaba in\nthe Transkei from departing whites.\nThe independence process began to falter when Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi,\npolitical leader of some  million Zulus, the largest ethnic group in the country,\ndecided to have no truck with it. Buthelezi\u2019s role in the apartheid system was a\ncomplex one. In his youth he was marked down by the authorities as a\ntroublemaker. While studying at Fort Hare he had joined the ANC\u2019s Youth\n\n\fLeague and in his final year he had been expelled for taking part in political\nprotest; among those whom he openly admired were Chief Luthuli and Mandela.\nButhelezi was nevertheless prepared to work within the apartheid system.\nElected as chief minister of KwaZulu in , he developed the art of opposing\nPretoria\u2019s homelands policy while at the same time playing a leading role in it.\nCooperation was justified, he argued, on pragmatic grounds. The homelands\npolicy enabled Zulus to acquire vital administrative experience which they\nwould be able to use to good effect in a multiracial South Africa in the future\nand it provided them too with a platform from which to oppose apartheid.\nUsing his position as a member of the Zulu royal family, Buthelezi built up a\npowerful cultural and political movement, Inkatha ye Nkululeko we Sizwe\n(Freedom of the Nation), which gained support not only in KwaZulu but in\nurban areas as well. Within a few years, In - katha claimed to have , paidup members, making it the largest black political organisation allowed to\nfunction in South Africa\u2019s history. Buthelezi himself, according to some opinion\npolls, was regarded by many Africans as a more important national leader than\nMandela. In , he won the first election in KwaZulu with nearly a clean\nsweep of the seats. As head of the KwaZulu government he possessed\nconsiderable powers of patronage and control and used them ruthlessly. In many\nrespects he resembled a tribal potentate, intolerant of criticism, brooking no\nopposition, given to making interminable speeches and constantly reminiscing\nabout the past exploits of the Zulu people. In sum, he seemed an ideal partner for\nthe government. But having lent the homelands system greater credibility than\nany other homeland leader, he then delivered it a crippling blow by refusing\nindependence.\nThe apartheid system was in trouble in other ways. The economic boom of the\ns, together with the increasing use of advanced production techniques, had\nresulted in such a serious shortage of skilled labour that further economic growth\nwas hampered. The reservoir of white skills had simply run out and white\nimmigration was not sufficient to fill the gap. White businessmen, for reasons of\nself-interest, argued that the only solution was to scrap the job reservation\nsystem giving whites a monopoly of skilled work and to allow blacks to move\nupwards in the labour market. They were critical of the government\u2019s vast\nsystem of labour controls which treated millions of workers who passed through\nit as \u2018an undifferentiated mass\u2019. What they wanted was a black labour force that\nwas better educated, more highly skilled and stable. They also favoured legal\n\n\frecognition of black trade unions, which would allow them to conduct industrial\nrelations on an orderly basis. A rash of strikes in  pointed to the urgent need\nfor improved labour conditions. The Soweto uprising in  intensified all\nthese arguments and added new ones. What employers now feared was the\nemergence of a new generation of radical activists who, in their hatred of\napartheid, might turn against the free-enterprise system as well.\nForeign criticism of apartheid also flared up in the wake of Soweto. The\nspectacle of armed police shooting schoolchildren in the streets brought\nworldwide condemnation. International opinion was again outraged the\nfollowing year by the death of the black-consciousness leader Steve Biko, in\nparticular the manner in which he died. After five days of brutal interrogation at\nsecurity police headquarters in Port Elizabeth, during which he suffered severe\nhead injuries, Biko was put naked into the back of a police truck, close to\ncollapse, provided with nothing more than a blanket and a bottle of water, and\ndriven for  miles to a prison hospital in Pretoria, where he died a few hours\nafter arriving, lying on a mat on a stone floor. He was the forty-sixth detainee to\ndie in police custody. News of his death unleashed a new wave of fury and\nviolence on the streets which the government eventually brought to a halt by\noutlawing virtually every black-consciousness organisation in the country and\ndetaining dozens of black leaders, as well as a number of white critics.\nIn Washington and Westminster, there were demands for economic boycotts\nand sanctions against South Africa. At the United Nations Security Council,\nmembers voted for a mandatory ban on arms sales to South Africa.\nRepresentatives from thirteen Western governments attended Biko\u2019s funeral to\nmark their own form of protest. Far more damaging was the reaction of foreign\ninvestors, who no longer looked at South Africa as such a stable or profitable\nhaven. Foreign capital, which had been a vital factor in helping South Africa to\nachieve high rates of economic growth, began to flow out. Several prominent\nAmerican and British banks terminated their South African business.\nMultinational companies with subsidiaries in South Africa faced intense\ncriticism from anti-apartheid groups, some demanding their withdrawal. For the\nfirst time, the costs of sustaining apartheid began to affect white interests.\n",
    "1974-1980": "",
    "1981-1987": " FREE MANDELA!\nAPART FROM MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY AND HIS LAWYERS, FEW\nOUTSIDERS had been permitted to see Mandela since his imprisonment in\n. The only regular outsiders he met were officials from the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross, who in public maintained a discreet silence about\ntheir visits. Other outsiders were allowed visits only if it suited the interests of\nthe government. A reporter and photographer from the London Daily Telegraph\nwere admitted to Robben Island in . Photographs taken on this occasion\nshowing Mandela and Sisulu talking together in the courtyard while prisoners\nworked on piles of stones behind them were used in the foreign press time after\ntime; but in South Africa itself, their publication was banned. A visit by a\nrepresentative of the American Bar Association was discussed by prisoners for\nmany months for the manner in which the American lawyer, perspiring heavily\nand somewhat inebriated, began to argue with Mandela about conditions on\nRobben Island, comparing them favourably to prison conditions he had observed\nin the United States.\nIn , a former British defence minister, Denis Healey, who had previously\nmet Mandela during his visit to London in , was given an hour to talk to\nhim in the presence of prison officials. \u2018I was relieved to find that intellectually,\nmorally and physically, he was fighting fit,\u2019 Healey reported. \u2018He wasn\u2019t in any\nway cast down by his experiences of the last eight years.\u2019 In , an Australian\njournalist, David MacNicoll, described Mandela wearing \u2018well-fitting fawn\nmoleskin coat and trousers, comfortable soft brown leather shoes, and red-andblue striped woollen socks\u2019. His eyes, he noted, were alert and humorous.\nPublic interest in Mandela\u2019s fate during these years hardly stirred and he\nremained a largely forgotten figure. During the early s, he wrote, when\nthere was no sign of any break in the apartheid system, the Rivonia prisoners had\nto force themselves not to give in to despair. But in the wake of the Soweto\nuprising and the repression that followed it, as anti-apartheid protest both at\n\n\fhome and abroad gathered momentum, Mandela in prison became a potent\nsymbol of opposition to the government. In March , the Soweto newspaper\nThe Post started a campaign demanding his release with the banner headline\nFREE MANDELA! Neither his photograph nor his words could be published.\nTo many people he seemed linked more to a distant past than of any relevance to\nthe future. But the campaign caught the public imagination, attracting support\nfrom white university students and liberal politicians, as well as a host of black\norganisations. A growing number of whites were becoming openly disenchanted\nwith the apartheid system. They included not just a large part of the Englishspeaking community but the Afrikaner elite\u2014businessmen, academics,\nprofessionals and journalists\u2014more affluent and broad-minded than before, and\nmore susceptible to foreign opinion about the iniquities of racial discrimination.\nAt a white election in , the opposition Progressive Federal Party, which\nadvocated the removal of racial discrimination and an extension of the franchise\nto all blacks, had attracted some  per cent of the vote. Afrikaans-language\nnewspapers were as outspoken as English-language newspapers in suggesting\nthat the government needed to negotiate with radical black leaders as well as\ntraditional ones.\nOn the eve of the twentieth anniversary of Sharpeville, in March , Zindzi\nMandela addressed a huge gathering organised by white students at the\nUniversity of the Witwatersrand supporting the call for Mandela\u2019s release. \u2018I\nhave not joined you as a daughter calling for the release of her father. I have\njoined as part of my generation who have never known what a normal life is,\u2019\nshe said. \u2018I\u2019ve seen the suffering of my people escalating to boiling point. I\u2019ve\nseen the thunderous eruption of the Soweto volcano when my generation could\ntake it no longer.\u2019 Mandela, when he was free, had offered solutions to South\nAfrica\u2019s problems. \u2018The call for Mandela\u2019s release is merely to say there is an\nalternative to the inevitable bloodbath.\u2019\nThe campaign to release Mandela was taken up in one country after another,\nmaking him one of the most famous prisoners in the world. In New York, the\nUnited Nations Security Council said his release was the only way to achieve\n\u2018meaningful discussion of the future of the country\u2019. In London, students\nnominated him as a candidate for the post of chancellor at the University of\nLondon; he received some , votes, losing only to Princess Anne.\nWinnie shared in some of the limelight. The story of her banishment to a\nremote, impoverished township after so many years of persecution was reported\n\n\faround the world. Foreign journalists and diplomats regularly made the journey\nto Brandfort to talk to her. With characteristic energy, she had set about trying to\nmake life at Brandfort more tolerable. She organised home improvements,\nestablished a garden and studied for a social science degree by correspondence.\nShe acquired a companion, a young Rastafarian artist called \u2018M. K.\u2019 Malefane,\nwho was introduced by Zindzi and subsequently moved into her house. Her\ngrandchildren came to stay with her.\nShe was also largely successful in overcoming the suspicions and hostility of\ntownship residents, organising a series of welfare projects for the local\ncommunity. She started a day-care centre, a soup kitchen, a mobile clinic and a\nsewing group, obtaining donations from relief organisations, foreign embassies\nand private individuals. As news of her work spread abroad, foreign funds for\nher projects flowed in. Letters of support arrived from church organisations,\ntrade unions and academic institutions.\nThe attention that Winnie received in Brandfort added to her sense of her own\nimportance. She enjoyed being known as \u2018Mother of the Nation\u2019, a title the press\nbegan to repeat endlessly. Her behaviour became increasingly imperious. She\ncame to see the struggle against apartheid more and more in personal terms. The\ndarker side of her character surfaced. She took to drinking heavily, running up\nhuge accounts at the local liquor store for champagne, Cinzano and spirits. In\nsome households in the neighbourhood, she was feared for her temper rather\nthan admired. The mother of a nine-year-old boy complained that Winnie had\nassaulted him with her belt buckle. While denying the charge, Winnie asserted\nshe had the right to discipline children who played on her premises. She was\nacquitted. In another incident, she was convicted of assaulting a woman with a\nbottle and a shoe. Winnie\u2019s propensity for settling matters through physical force\nbecame more marked.\nAs the clamour for Mandela\u2019s release continued, the government decided to\nmove him from Robben Island to a prison on the mainland near Cape Town\ncalled Pollsmoor. Robben Island itself had become a part of the legend the\ngovernment was anxious to destroy. Without warning, one night at the end of\nMarch , Mandela was told he was to be transferred immediately from the\nisland, along with Sisulu, Mhlaba and Mlangeni. Kathrada joined them a few\nmonths later.\nLeaving Robben Island after eighteen years was an unsettling experience for\n\n\fMandela. He had become accustomed to its routine. It was a place where he felt\ncomfortable. But above all, it had become a focal point of resistance to\napartheid. All the hardships that had been endured, all the campaigns for\nimprovements that had been fought, all the efforts made to turn the island into a\nuniversity had become part of a powerful tradition which he had helped to shape\nand to lead. Prisoners leaving Robben Island often did so with a sense of\nachievement rather than of loss. The prison community there was remembered as\na valued part of their lives. The bonds of friendship and loyalty forged were\ngreater than anything experienced outside. One of Mandela\u2019s companions, Mac\nMaharaj, reflecting years later on the decades of struggle against apartheid,\nremarked, \u2018Paradoxically, some of the happiest times in that whole long struggle\nwere in the company of my comrades on Robben Island.\u2019\nMandela was now cut off from all this. His abrupt departure meant that he had\nno time even to say farewell properly to friends with whom he had shared so\nmany ordeals. Nor was there the slightest prospect that he would ever be\nreleased. Responding to the campaign for his release, the prime minister, P. W.\nBotha, denounced him as an \u2018arch-Marxist\u2019 committed to violent revolution who\nwould have to serve the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on him by a\ncourt of law.\n\nBotha first made a name for himself in politics as a roughneck breaking up his\nopponents\u2019 meetings. He climbed through the ranks of the National Party to\nreach the post of defence minister, and then emerged unexpectedly as prime\nminister in  as the result of a vicious struggle for power between two rival\ncamps within the party, the verkrampte wing, the name given to its more\nnarrowminded, reactionary members, and the verligte wing, the name given to\nits more openminded, enlightened ones. Like Verwoerd and Vorster, Botha was\nan authoritarian figure, singleminded, ruthless and intolerant of opposition. His\ncommitment to the cause of white supremacy was no less tenacious than theirs,\nbut he preferred a pragmatic approach to the conduct of government rather than\nan ideological one. His objective was to modernise apartheid, to rid it of its more\nimpractical encumbrances, to make it function more effectively. This was an\nobjective supported by Afrikaner businessmen, increasingly frustrated by the\ncosts of apartheid, and by the military establishment, which had become openly\ncritical about the lack of urgency shown by the government in tackling the\nfundamental issues thrown up by the Soweto revolt. As defence minister for\n\n\ftwelve years, Botha was close to the military\u2019s way of thinking. What the\nmilitary wanted above all were defensible political goals.\nBotha began his term of office by emphasising the need for change. \u2018We are\nmoving in a changing world,\u2019 he said. \u2018We must adapt, otherwise we shall die.\u2019\nIn one speech after another, he repeated the same message across the country: \u2018A\nwhite monopoly of power is untenable in the Africa of today. . . . A meaningful\ndivision of power is needed between all race groups. . . . Apartheid is a recipe for\npermanent conflict.\u2019\nThe air was thick with the promises of reform. Botha declared himself to be in\nfavour of removing \u2018hurtful unnecessary discrimination\u2019 and suggested that laws\nbanning interracial marriage and sex should no longer be regarded as \u2018holy\ncows\u2019. Petty apartheid, once a key government objective, aimed at keeping\nblacks apart from whites in the use of public amenities such as park benches,\npost office windows, museums and libraries, began to fray at the edges. White\nofficials, accustomed to abusing blacks at will, were now told to handle them\nwith respect.\nProceeding with extreme caution, Botha also initiated moves to improve\nconditions in black urban areas. After thirty years of harsh legislation designed\nto prevent the African population from putting down roots in white areas, the\ngovernment finally recognised their right to live there permanently, according\nthem property rights. Restrictions on African, Coloured and Indian businessmen\nwere eased. New housing programmes were started. An electrification project\nfor Soweto was set in motion. Plans to remove Alexandra, the black ghetto north\nof Johannesburg surrounded by affluent white suburbs, which Verwoerd had\ncondemned as a \u2018black spot\u2019 and marked down for destruction, were abandoned.\nA similar reprieve was given to the Crossroads squatter settlement outside Cape\nTown, whose inhabitants had achieved international fame by defying the\ngovernment\u2019s forceful efforts to expel them and raze the settlement to the\nground. Botha made his personal contribution towards trying to establish better\nrelations with the black community by paying a visit to Soweto, the first prime\nminister ever to set foot in a black township, proclaiming as he did so, \u2018We are\nall South Africans.\u2019\nLabour conditions also improved. African workers were permitted to join\nregistered unions. Most job reservation laws were scrapped. In the field of\neducation, the government committed itself to the goal of providing equal,\n\n\fthough separate, education for all population groups, while emphasising that \u2018the\nhistorical backlog cannot be overcome overnight\u2019. By  only seven times as\nmuch was spent on white children per capita as on African children, compared to\nthe sixteen times of . The government\u2019s purpose henceforth was to create\nstable black urban communities with a vested interest in the free-enterprise\nsystem.\nAlongside this programme of reform, Botha began to develop a national\nsecurity system designed to overcome any challenge mounted against the\ngovernment either internally or externally. He was convinced that South Africa\nwas the target of an internationally organised communist strategy to overthrow\nthe government and replace it with a Marxist regime beholden to the Soviet\nUnion. Botha had a fixed and simple view of world politics, believing that they\nrevolved around a struggle between communist and anti-communist forces, with\nSouth Africa and its vast mineral resources and maritime facilities the glittering\nprize. Whatever ills befell South Africa, whether it was domestic unrest,\ninternational pressure or regional threats, he attributed ultimately to Moscow\u2019s\ngrand design. Every adversity was seen as part of a \u2018total onslaught\u2019 that South\nAfrica faced. In this scheme of things the ANC was to figure prominently.\nIn its years of exile since , the ANC had met with mixed fortunes. Oliver\nTambo had travelled the world seeking to build support in as many different\nquarters as possible and gaining widespread respect for his skill at diplomacy in\nthe process. The Soviet Union had given most support, providing funds,\nequipment and training. But assistance had also been forthcoming from Sweden,\nDenmark, Norway and Holland and a host of political parties, trade unions,\nstudent groups and church organisations across the Western world. At the United\nNations, the ANC had been granted observer status since  and allowed\naccess to international agencies from which the South African government had\nbeen banned. The number of ANC \u2018embassies\u2019 around the world surpassed the\nnumber maintained by the South African government.\nBut as for its main task of confronting the regime at home, the ANC had little\nto show. At a conference in  at its military headquarters in Morogoro in\nTanzania, where guerrilla training camps had been established four years earlier,\nthe ANC formed a revolutionary council with responsibility for conducting\nguerrilla warfare and expressed its strategy for the first time in revolutionary\nterms. Among the members of the revolutionary council were Tambo, the\nANC\u2019s president since the death of Chief Luthuli in , Yusuf Dadoo, the\n\n\fIndian communist leader, and Joe Slovo, still the chief of staff of Umkhonto we\nSizwe. For the first time, too, the ANC opened its membership to whites,\nColoureds and Indians.\nYet for all the enthusiasm shown for revolutionary ideas, the ANC\u2019s years in\nexile were marked more by internal dissension and disputes than by any\nheadway made in implementing them. Located , miles away from the\nborders of South Africa, unable to find a way through the surrounding white\nbuffer states of Angola, Rhodesia and Mozambique, the guerrillas in Tanzania\nsuccumbed to boredom, frustration and inertia. In the leadership, splits\ndeveloped over the decision to allow whites to join the ANC\u2019s ranks and over\nthe role of members of the Communist Party. Attempts made to infiltrate agents\ninto South Africa were often amateurish, detected well in advance by Pretoria\u2019s\nspies, who penetrated deep into the organisation.\nThe change in the ANC\u2019s fortunes came when Angola and Mo - zambique\nwere taken over by nationalist guerrilla movements in  and the Soweto\nrevolt the following year brought an army of eager recruits. In the wake of the\nuprising, some , youths left South Africa, most of them joining the ANC.\nMany went to military camps established in northern Angola under the control of\nANC instructors. The more promising recruits were sent for training in the\nSoviet Union and East Germany. The capital of Mozambique, Maputo, less than\nfifty miles from the South African border, became a key operational centre, to\nwhere much of Umkhonto\u2019s command structure was transferred. Joe Slovo\nmoved there in , with his wife, Ruth First. ANC groups were also set up in\nBotswana, Swaziland and Lesotho to help establish an internal network and to\nsupervise the flow of recruits.\nFrom , Umkhonto began a low-level sabotage campaign, selecting targets\nmainly with a high propaganda value, intending more to re-establish a political\nfollowing among the black population and to raise its morale than to threaten the\neconomy or white security. Its targets included police stations in black\nresidential areas, administrative buildings, railway lines and electricity\nsubstations. A number of informers, security policemen and state witnesses were\nassassinated. From  more ambitious targets were selected. That year, ANC\nguerrillas attacked industrial plants in Sasolburg and Secunda, destroying fuel\nstorage tanks; in , rockets were fired at the Voortrekkerhoogte military\nbase; in , bombs exploded in the Koeberg nuclear power station near Cape\nTown, damaging one of the reactors and two transformers; in , a car-bomb\n\n\fattack was made outside a military building in Pretoria, killing sixteen people\nand injuring more than \u2014the most serious sabotage incident in South\nAfrica\u2019s history.\nThe government retaliated against neighbouring states with a combination of\nmilitary might and economic coercion intended to force them into submission\nand to expel the ANC. Its main target was Mozambique. From bases in the\nTransvaal, the South African military trained, armed and directed a rebel group\nwhose purpose was to create havoc in Mozambique, attacking bridges, railways,\nroad transport, schools and clinics. Direct military raids were made on ANC\ntargets in Maputo. In , a parcel bomb sent to the Eduardo Mondlane\nUniversity in Maputo killed Ruth First. Mozambique was also subjected to\neconomic pressure. Similar methods were used against Angola, Lesotho and\nSwaziland. Assassination squads were used at home and abroad.\nUnable to withstand the pressure, South Africa\u2019s neighbours capitulated, one\nby one, to its demands. In , Mozambique expelled some  ANC\nmembers, allowing only a mission of ten to remain. Deprived of its most\nimportant forward positions, the ANC was forced to operate from headquarters\nin Lusaka, Zambia, hundreds of miles away from the front line.\n\nBotha, meanwhile, proceeded with a plan for constitutional change, which he\nconfidently expected would become the centrepiece of his reform programme.\nHe intended to expand the political base of the white population by incorporating\nthe Coloured and Indian communities into the white political system, providing\nthem with political rights while ensuring that political power remained securely\nin the hands of the whites. The terminology he used for describing this exercise\nwas \u2018a healthy form of power sharing\u2019. Much emphasis was placed on the\nimportance of \u2018group rights\u2019, a term which, according to the government, meant\nthat each race group was allowed to govern itself without interference or\ndomination by any other group, but which in practice added up to little more\nthan the old system of racial separation run by whites. Parliament was to be\ndivided into three chambers: a House of Assembly for whites, a House of\nRepresentatives for Coloureds and a House of Delegates for Indians. Each\nchamber was to be given responsibility for its \u2018own\u2019 affairs, such as education,\nhealth and housing, leaving other major portfolios, such as law and order and\nfinance, in the hands of the government. A new office of state president was to\n\n\fbe established, giving the head of government greatly increased powers. No\nrepresentation was accorded to the black population. Botha\u2019s view was that\nblacks had been given sufficient political representation through the homelands\nsystem. All that he was prepared to concede to urban blacks were elected local\ncouncils.\nBotha\u2019s proposals, as he had expected, caused uproar in the verkrampte wing\nof the National Party, which regarded any attempt to tamper with Verwoerd\u2019s\ndoctrine of total separation as heresy. A group of Nationalist MPs broke away to\nform the Conservative Party, advocating a return to absolute apartheid, a\ngeographical separation of the races, with homelands for Coloureds and Indians\nas well as Africans. New extremist groups sprang up competing for the loyalty\nof the volk. But Botha was vindicated by the results of a white referendum in\nNovember  in which two-thirds of the white electorate voted in favour of\nthe new constitution.\nWhat Botha did not anticipate was the extent of opposition to the new\nconstitution organised by anti-apartheid groups. In August , delegates\nrepresenting more than  organisations, including trade unions, youth groups,\nstudent bodies and community associations, met in Mitchell\u2019s Plains, a Coloured\ntownship near Cape Town, to launch the United Democratic Front to coordinate\nprotest against the new constitution in the broadest display of public opposition\nto apartheid in nearly thirty years. The UDF was a conscious effort to revive the\nstyle of nationalist politics adopted by the Congress movement of the s. It\nfunctioned as a popular front rather than as a political organisation. It set out\nonly the broadest aims\u2014to create a united democratic South Africa free from\nhomelands and group areas and based on the will of the people\u2014leaving its\naffiliates to decide their own activities. Its purpose was to draw together as wide\na range of opposition forces as possible, cutting across lines of class and colour.\nWhite organisations, such as the National Union of South African Students, were\nwelcomed into its fold and soon some  organisations were members. Among\nthe leaders were veterans from the s Congress campaigns, including Archie\nGumede, a Durban lawyer who served as chairman of the Release Mandela\nCommittee, Helen Joseph, the veteran civil rights activist, and Albertina Sisulu.\nLike Winnie Mandela, Albertina Sisulu had endured years of imprisonment,\nsolitary confinement, house arrest and harassment, and was greatly admired and\nrespected by anti-apartheid activists. At the time, she was being held in prison, in\nsolitary confinement, without charge. One of the patrons chosen by the UDF was\n\n\fNelson Mandela.\n\nMandela was kept informed of these events. In his new abode in Pollsmoor\nPrison, he was allowed to receive a wide range of newspapers and magazines,\nincluding Time magazine and the Guardian Weekly from London, reading every\nedition from cover to cover. He was also able to listen to local radio stations.\nOverall, living conditions in Pollsmoor for Mandela and his colleagues were a\nconsiderable improvement on Robben Island. They were allocated a spacious\nroom on the top floor of a prison wing, with an adjacent section containing\ntoilets and showers. They were given proper beds with sheets. They were served\nmeals with meat and vegetables and allowed to buy special provisions each\nmonth. They were provided with two rooms for use as a library and for study\npurposes and a wide variety of books and films. They also had access to a large\nroof-top terrace for exercise; tennis matches on the roof were taken very\nseriously. They were free to get up when they wanted.\nDespite these improvements, however, they all hankered for the life on\nRobben Island. They missed their comrades there, the openness of the island, the\nviews across the sea to the mountains on the mainland beyond, the sounds of the\nbirds, the roar of the surf, the flowers and wildlife. Pollsmoor, by contrast, was a\nmodern concrete building, where the only view was of the concrete walls which\nsurrounded them. Their terrace, though half the size of a football pitch, was\ncovered in black rubberised matting and contained by high concrete walls,\npainted white, which during the summer became unbearably hot. The only\nglimpse of the outside world they had was a partial sight of the ridges of the\nnearby Steenberg mountain; all the rest was sky. As Mandela later told a visitor,\nhe came to know what Oscar Wilde meant by \u2018the little tent of blue that\nprisoners call the sky\u2019. They made repeated requests to be transferred back to\nRobben Island, but to no avail.\nTo compensate for their drab surroundings, Mandela constructed a large\ngarden on the terrace using sixteen oil drums sliced in half and filled with rich,\nloamy soil taken from the prison grounds. Mandela\u2019s garden became a centre of\ninterest not only for his colleagues, who helped with the work, but also for the\nprison commander, Brigadier Munro, a gardening enthusiast, and prison staff,\nwho provided him with seeds and manure. Each morning, after his normal round\nof exercises, Mandela put on an old straw hat and gardening gloves and tended\n\n\fhis plants for two hours. The size of the garden steadily grew. At one stage, there\nwere  plants\u2014onions, aubergines, cabbages, cauliflowers, beans, spinach,\ncarrots, cucumbers, broccoli, beetroots, lettuces, tomatoes, peppers, strawberries\nand a variety of herbs. The produce went both to common-law prisoners and to\nwarders.\nThe visiting arrangements at Pollsmoor were also much improved. Instead of\nthe dingy, cramped, box-like compartments on Robben Island, Pollsmoor had\nspacious cubicles fitted with large glass partitions through which visitors and\nprisoners could see each other clearly from the waist up and with modern\nmicrophones which enabled them to hear properly.\nFor Mandela, a moment of pure joy came in March  when he was\nallowed his first \u2018contact\u2019 with Winnie. The government conceded contact visits\nonly after prolonged pressure from the International Committee of the Red\nCross. For the occasion, Mandela was taken to a room separate from the main\nvisiting area which his personal warder, James Gregory, had endeavoured to\nmake more pleasant with some comfortable furniture. Winnie arrived at the\nprison in the company of Zindzi and Zindzi\u2019s youngest son, Gadaffi, not\nknowing how different this visit would be. Accompanied by Gregory, she was\nshown into the room, where Mandela was sitting in a large, easy chair. He stood\nup as Winnie rushed across the room towards him, squealing with delight. They\nhugged and kissed, laughing with pleasure. It was a moment of which Mandela\nhad long dreamed, the first time he had touched Winnie in nearly twenty years.\nThen he embraced Zindzi, whom he had last held as a baby. For the rest of the\nvisit, Mandela held Gadaffi in his arms. The following day, Winnie, Zindzi and\nGadaffi returned for a two-hour visit. In two days, Mandela used up his entire\nquota of visits for the month.\nBut, as always with members of his family, trouble was never far away. In\nJune , Zindzi was attacked by her boyfriend, Patrick Moshidi, the father of\nGadaffi, who punched, kicked and stabbed her in the hand and head, leaving her\nfor dead unconscious on a hillside. She was found and taken to hospital, where\nshe spent several days in intensive care. In August , while Winnie was\nvisiting doctors in Johannesburg, her house in Brandfort and the adjacent clinic\nwere wrecked by petrol bombs. While waiting for repairs to be completed,\nWinnie remained in her house in Orlando West, technically in defiance of her\nbanning order.\n\n\fMandela\u2019s relationship with Makgatho and Makaziwe was also uneasy.\nMakgatho stopped visiting his father in , hating the constant goading about\nhis failure to improve his education. Makaziwe also seemed to disappoint him.\nAfter she had succeeded in obtaining a degree from Fort Hare, Mandela made\nclear his view that she should study for a higher degree abroad. When she took a\njob as a social worker instead, he wrote her a scathing rebuke, condemning her\nlack of ambition. She subsequently went on to study abroad, but became largely\nestranged from her father.\n\nThroughout , a mood of tension was spreading among the black population.\nAn economic recession, more severe than anything South Africa had known for\nfifty years, cast thousands into unemployment. The inflation rate climbed,\ncausing a squeeze on black living standards. Rural areas were hit by a\ndevastating drought. Student groups were active once more, protesting at low\neducational standards. The elections for Coloured and Indian representatives to\nthe new tricameral parliament in August raised the temperature still further. A\nlow turn-out of voters\u2014less than one in five Coloureds and Indians thought\nthere was any point in voting\u2014suggested massive disapproval of the new\nconstitution. African resentment at being excluded from parliament reached new\nheights. The new system of local government for African townships, introduced\nin , also provoked widespread opposition. Rent increases imposed to help\nfinance new councils brought sharp protests. Local councillors, elected in poorly\nattended polls, were denounced as \u2018stooges\u2019 and \u2018collaborators\u2019.\nIn September, outbreaks of violence began. They were sporadic at first,\nignited by local grievances, flaring up with great intensity, shifting from one area\nto the next and gradually drawing in more and more of an urban population that\nwas alienated and hostile. At the forefront were groups of black youths\n\u2014\u2018comrades\u2019, as they came to be known\u2014determined to destroy \u2018the system\u2019\nand ready to defy armed police and soldiers in the dusty and decrepit streets of\nthe townships with stones, catapults and petrol bombs. Many saw themselves as\nthe shock troops of revolution and believed that it was within their reach.\nStudents joined the fray, forsaking their classrooms once more. \u2018Liberation\nbefore Education\u2019 became their slogan. The townships\u2019 revolt, however, was not\nsolely a \u2018children\u2019s war\u2019, as it had been in . This time the revolt was part of\na popular movement involving entire communities\u2014parents, teachers, workers,\nchurchmen and women. Nor were the aims of the black activists confined to\n\n\fresolving particular grievances. This time the objective was to overthrow\napartheid.\nUrged on by the ANC in exile to mount \u2018a people\u2019s war\u2019 and make the\ntownships ungovernable, young comrades enforced consumer boycotts,\norganised rent strikes, attacked government buildings, set up \u2018people\u2019s courts\u2019\nand hunted down \u2018collaborators\u2019\u2014township councillors, local policemen and\nothers deemed to support \u2018the system\u2019. Their trademark became \u2018the necklace\u2019\nmethod of killing\u2014a tyre filled with petrol thrown over a victim and set on fire.\nThe government responded with a show of military might intended to\ndemonstrate to the white electorate as well as to the truculent black population\nthat it was fully in command. A combined force of paramilitary police and\ntroops moved into the townships around the industrial centres of southern\nTransvaal, the epicentre of the first cycle of violence. Opposition groups replied\nwith their own show of strength, calling for a two-day stay-away, demanding the\nwithdrawal of the army and the police from the townships. As well as student\ngroups and local UDF affiliates, labour unions undertook to support the stayaway, lending their weight for the first time to a mass protest over political\ngrievances. The stay-away was the most successful of its kind in nearly thirtyfive years. Convinced that forceful action would curb the \u2018unrest\u2019, the\ngovernment ordered the detention of union and community leaders.\nWhite business leaders were appalled both at the mayhem and at the\ngovernment\u2019s lack of any clear strategy for dealing with black grievances other\nthan repression, and joined in open criticism of government policy. Abroad,\nthere was mounting anti-apartheid activity. From late , the anti-apartheid\nmovement in the United States gained significant momentum for the first time,\nattracting support for campaigns aimed at getting US corporations to withdraw\nfrom South Africa.\nConfronted by a rising clamour for major reform at home and abroad, Botha\nhad only a limited stock of ideas upon which to draw. He was prepared to make\nmodifications to the apartheid system but only where they did not diminish white\npower and privilege. He accepted the need to allow Africans in urban areas\ngreater status, promised to open central business districts to all races, agreed to\nsuspend the forced removals policy, repealed laws prohibiting sex and marriage\nacross the colour line and talked of possible changes to influx controls.\nBotha also came up with what he believed was a subtle solution to the\n\n\fMandela problem. Demands for Mandela\u2019s release were by now universal.\nWestern governments saw this as an essential prelude to a negotiated settlement\nbetween the government and the black population. Botha\u2019s plan was to offer to\nrelease Mandela on condition that he publicly renounced the use of violence. If\nhe refused, then the international community would understand why the\ngovernment could not release him and the blame for his imprisonment would\nrest with Mandela himself and not the government.\nAddressing the House of Assembly on  January , Botha declared:\nThe government is willing to consider Mr Mandela\u2019s release in the Republic of\nSouth Africa on condition that Mr Mandela gives a full commitment that he will\nnot make himself guilty of planning, instigating or committing acts of violence\nfor the furtherance of political objectives, but will conduct himself in such a way\nthat he will not again have to be arrested. It is therefore not the South African\ngovernment which now stands in the way of Mr Mandela\u2019s freedom. It is\nhimself. The choice is his. All that is required of him now is that he should\nunconditionally reject violence as a political instrument. This is, after all, a norm\nwhich is respected in all civilized countries of the world.\nMandela\u2019s reply was forthright. It was read out in public by Zindzi on \nFebruary at a mass rally at a stadium in Soweto called by the UDF to celebrate\nthe award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the anti-apartheid activist Bishop\nDesmond Tutu.\nI am surprised at the conditions that the government wants to impose on\nme. I am not a violent man. My colleagues and I wrote in  to Malan\nasking for a round-table conference to find a solution to the problems of\nour country, but that was ignored. When Strijdom was in power, we\nmade the same offer. Again it was ignored. When Verwoerd was in\npower, we asked for a national convention for all the people in South\nAfrica to decide on their future. This, too, was in vain.\nIt was only then, when all other forms of resistance were no longer\nopen to us, that we turned to armed struggle. Let Botha show that he is\ndifferent than Malan, Strijdom and Verwoerd. Let him renounce\nviolence. Let him say that he will dismantle apartheid. Let him unban the\npeople\u2019s organization, the African National Congress. Let him free all\nwho have been imprisoned, banished or exiled for their opposition to\napartheid. Let him guarantee free political activity so that people may\n\n\fdecide who will govern them.\nI cherish my own freedom dearly, but I care even more for your\nfreedom. Too many have died since I went to prison. Too many have\nsuffered for the love of freedom. I owe it to their widows, to their\norphans, to their mothers and to their fathers who have grieved and wept\nfor them. Not only I have suffered during these long, lonely, wasted\nyears. I am not less life-loving than you are. But I cannot sell my\nbirthright, nor am I prepared to sell the birthright of the people to be free.\nI am in prison as the representative of the people and of your\norganization, the African National Congress, which was banned.\nWhat freedom am I being offered while the organization of the people\nremains banned? What freedom am I being offered when I may be\narrested on a pass offence? What freedom am I being offered to live my\nlife as a family with my dear wife who remains in banishment in\nBrandfort? What freedom am I being offered when I need a stamp in my\npass to seek work? What freedom am I being offered when my very\nSouth African citizenship is not respected?\nOnly free men can negotiate. Prisoners cannot enter into contracts. . . .\nI cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when I and you, the\npeople, are not free.\nThese were the first words heard from Mandela in public since his final\naddress in the Supreme Court in Pretoria more than twenty years before. The\ncrowd erupted in a wild display of cheering and chanting. TALKING WITH THE ENEMY\nTHE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION FOCUSED UPON MANDELA MADE THE\ngovernment acutely concerned about his conditions in prison. There was a\nconstant worry that he might die, setting off an avalanche of condemnation and\nprotest. Rumours of his ill-health and ill treatment frequently circulated,\nsometimes started deliberately by Winnie. During one visit she paid to Mandela\nin , he complained he had been issued with a new pair of shoes which were\na size too small and pinched his toe. He said he would return them and get\nanother pair, and was subsequently treated in hospital for a sore toenail. But as\nWinnie reported the matter, Mandela had been forced to wear shoes that were\ntoo small for him and as a result had had to have a toe amputated. Articles in the\nforeign press referred to such ill-treatment and suggested the prison authorities\nin Pollsmoor were trying to break his spirit. When the veteran opposition MP\nHelen Suzman visited Mandela to ascertain the truth, she asked how his foot was\nafter the operation. Mandela at first looked blank and then said, \u2018Oh, you mean\nthe toenail that was removed. That\u2019s fine. It was my fault really, as I ordered the\nwrong size shoe.\u2019 He took off his sock, held his bare foot up to the glass partition\nand wiggled his toes.\nTo demonstrate that Mandela was in good health and being well treated, the\ngovernment allowed a number of foreign visitors to interview him. Just before\nChristmas in , Nicholas Bethell, a member of the British House of Lords\nand of the European Parliament, met him in the prison commander\u2019s office. His\naccount of the meeting appeared in a British newspaper in January .\nMandela entered the room in the company of two senior prison officers\u2014\u2018a sixfoot-tall, lean figure, with silvery hair, an impeccable olive-green shirt and wellcreased navy blue trousers\u2019. His manner was self-assured. He was anxious to put\nBethell at his ease and invited him to sit down at the commander\u2019s desk, where\nhe could take notes. He confirmed that he was in good health: it was not true, he\nsaid, that he had cancer or that he had had a toe amputated. He was\ncomplimentary about the helpful attitude of senior officers. He listed a number\n\n\fof complaints\u2014a damp patch on the wall of his room, the lack of contact with\nother political prisoners, the need for more family visits\u2014but mentioned nothing\nto cause Bethell undue concern. \u2018The problem is, therefore, not one of brutal\nprison conditions,\u2019 said Bethell. \u2018It is that Mandela and his friends are in prison\nat all.\u2019\nMandela explained his position about the armed struggle:\nThe armed struggle was forced on us by the government. And if they want us\nnow to give it up, the ball is in their court. They must legalize us, treat us as a\npolitical party and negotiate with us. Until they do, we will have to live with the\narmed struggle. . . Of course, if there were to be talks along these lines, we in the\nANC would declare a truce.\nWhen the interview ended, Brigadier Munro invited Bethell to visit Mandela\u2019s\nquarters.\nWe walked in slow procession up flights of stairs and around corners,\nwith Mandela leading the way as if showing me around his home. He did\nnot open doors for me; this was done by sergeants with heavy keys after\nmuch saluting and clanking. Always, though, Mandela was the one who\nshowed the way, inviting me to go first through every door and plying\nme with questions on Britain and the world . . .\nMandela introduced Bethell to his cell mates and proudly showed him his\nvegetable garden before saying goodbye. As a sergeant opened the grey, heavy\nsteel door, Mandela shook hands, saying, \u2018Well, Lord Bethell, this is my frontier,\nand this is where I must leave you.\u2019\nA few weeks later, Samuel Dash, a professor of law at Georgetown\nUniversity, met Mandela and he too testified to his commanding personality. He\ndescribed him as looking younger than his sixty-six years. \u2018He appeared\nvigorous and healthy with a calm, confident manner and dignified bearing that\nseemed incongruous in our prison surroundings. Indeed, throughout our meeting\nI felt that I was in the presence not of a guerrilla fighter or radical ideologue, but\na head of state.\u2019\nDash asked him if he took any encouragement from suggestions that the\ngovernment might repeal laws banning interracial marriage and ease influx\ncontrols. Mandela smiled. \u2018You are speaking about pinpricks,\u2019 he replied.\n\u2018Frankly, it is not my ambition to marry a white woman or to swim in a white\n\n\fpool. The central issue is political equality.\u2019\nMandela outlined three basic principles for a future South Africa: a unitary\nstate without homelands; non-racial elections for parliament; and one-person\none-vote. Dash asked how this programme would affect the white population,\nmany of whom feared that political equality would mean subjugation at the\nhands of an embittered black majority. Mandela stressed that this was a\nfundamental concern of the ANC\u2019s leadership. \u2018Unlike white people anywhere\nelse in Africa, whites in South Africa belong here\u2014this is their home,\u2019 Mandela\nsaid. \u2018We want them to live here with us and to share power with us.\u2019\nBut, Dash asked, how could he reconcile such moderate positions with the\nANC\u2019s avowed goal of overthrowing the regime by force? Mandela replied that\nhe wished the changes he sought for South Africa could be achieved peacefully.\nAnd he conceded that blacks would suffer most if they resorted to violence.\n\u2018However,\u2019 he said, \u2018if white leaders do not act in good faith towards us, if they\nwill not meet with us to discuss political equality, and if, in effect, they tell us\nthat we must remain subjugated by the whites, then there is really no alternative\nfor us other than violence. And, I assure you, we will prevail. \u2019 Because of the\nmilitary power of the South African government, blacks could not defeat the\nwhite regime in direct combat, but, over time, \u2018we can make life most miserable\nfor them\u2019.\n\nA second cycle of violence, more intense and more prolonged, began in March\n, centred on the townships of the Eastern Cape. Army units were sent in to\nquell the violence but their efforts made little impact. In June, the focus of\n\u2018unrest\u2019 shifted to the mining towns of the East Rand. In July, Soweto erupted.\nAs well as the daily chronicle of violence, there was an upsurge of boycotts,\nstay-aways, rent strikes, marches and demonstrations. Funeral services were\nturned into political rallies where ANC flags and banners were openly flaunted,\nall adding to the climate of insurrection.\nIn July, Botha declared a state of emergency in thirty-six magisterial districts\nin the Eastern Cape, the East Rand, the Vaal Triangle and Johannesburg, giving\nthe police and the army virtually unlimited powers to deal with the local\npopulation. Security forces arrested hundreds of community leaders, student\nactivists, church workers and union officials, hoping to break the back of local\nopposition. Assassination squads were once more at work.\n\n\fThe daily spectacle of violent protest and government repression, shown on\ntelevision screens around the world, provoked a chorus of international\ncondemnation and calls for action against Botha\u2019s government to force him to\nundertake major reforms and open negotiations with black leaders, including\nMandela. Foreign investors, taking fright at the continuing violence and the\npossibility of international action, began unloading their South African shares.\nAmerican banks decided to stop rolling over loans to South African borrowers,\nstarting a chain reaction which pitched South Africa into a major financial crisis.\nIn an attempt to restore foreign confidence, government officials promised\nthat major reforms were imminent and pointed to an address that Botha was due\nto make at the opening of a National Party conference in Durban on  August\nas a likely occasion on which they would be unveiled. The foreign minister, Pik\nBotha, travelled to Western capitals bearing the glad tidings and pledging that a\nformula would be found that would permit the unconditional release of Mandela.\nInternational interest in what Botha would say was intense.\nBut Botha never reacted well to pressure, either from the international\ncommunity or from cabinet ministers anxious to proceed faster with reform. In a\ntruculent performance that was watched on television around the world, Botha,\nwagging his finger, contemptuously dismissed demands for more change. \u2018I am\nnot prepared to lead white South Africa and other minority groups on a road to\nabdication and suicide,\u2019 he said. He offered not a single new reform, blamed\nviolence in the townships on \u2018communist agitators\u2019 and the foreign media, and\ncastigated his critics at home and abroad, warning, \u2018Don\u2019t push us too far.\u2019\nIt was a display of intransigence which worked well with Afrikaner audiences\nbut made South Africa a leper in the world\u2019s financial markets. Foreign investors\ndeserted South Africa in droves. The value of the rand plunged. The government\nwas forced to suspend trading on the foreign exchange market, to close the\nJohannesburg stock exchange for five days and to impose a unilateral\nmoratorium on the repayment of foreign debt.\nThe tide of opinion against South Africa was so strong that even conservative\nWestern leaders like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, previously\noutspoken in their opposition to sanctions as a means of dealing with South\nAfrica, were obliged to agree to a package of measures. Though the action taken\nin Washington and London was of largely token significance, it was a sign of the\nstrength of hostility towards South Africa that it was taken at all. At a\n\n\fCommonwealth conference in October, Thatcher joined other Commonwealth\nleaders in calling on Botha to dismantle apartheid, end the state of emergency,\nlift the ban on the ANC and release Mandela.\nWhite business leaders, appalled by the unending cycle of black anger,\ngovernment ineptitude, disinvestment, financial mayhem and international\nsanctions, lined up to condemn the government\u2019s failure to introduce meaningful\nreforms, and demanded urgent action, including the release of Mandela and\nmoves to establish a new political system involving \u2018genuine power sharing\u2019. In\nSeptember, a small group of businessmen, led by the chairman of the AngloAmerican Corporation, Gavin Relly, took the audacious step of flying to Zambia\nfor talks with Oliver Tambo and other ANC leaders. The meeting took place at a\nlodge in a wildlife park, with the ANC members dressed impeccably in suits and\nties and the businessmen wearing more casual attire, looking almost unkempt by\ncomparison. \u2018What we are concerned with,\u2019 Relly told Tambo, \u2018is not so much\nwhether the following generation will be governed by white or black people, but\nthat [South Africa] will be a viable country and that it will not be destroyed by\nviolence and strife.\u2019 Tambo replied that he personally abhorred violence\u2014\u2018I\neven take insects out of the bath\u2019\u2014but warned that the conflict was bound to\nescalate unless apartheid was dis - mantled. At the end of the meeting, the\nparticipants all declared their satisfaction with the outcome. \u2018It was one of the\nnicest days I\u2019ve ever spent,\u2019 said Relly. \u2018A picnic among South Africans talking\nabout their future together.\u2019 Botha denounced the businessmen for their\n\u2018disloyalty\u2019 and for showing \u2018signs of weakness towards the enemies of South\nAfrica\u2019.\nFrom Pollsmoor, Mandela took his own initiative, writing to the minister of\njustice, police and prisons, Kobie Coetsee, pressing him for a meeting to discuss\ntalks between the ANC and the government. He received no reply.\nBy the end of , now anxious to improve South Africa\u2019s standing with\nforeign banks and foreign governments and to head off the possibility of another\ndebt crisis and a more punishing round of sanctions, Botha was ready to move\nahead with further reforms. Apartheid, he declared in January , was \u2018an\noutdated concept\u2019. Finally conceding the inevitability of African urbanisation, he\nagreed to scrap the pass laws and influx controls that were once considered vital\nprotection for the white population and had for much of the century constituted a\ncrippling burden for the African population. He pledged his commitment to\n\u2018power sharing\u2019 and proposed to establish a new national forum to represent\n\n\fAfrican interests which he hoped would appeal to moderate African leaders. He\ntalked of a \u2018single South Africa\u2019 with \u2018one citizenship\u2019 for all South Africans,\nshedding all further notion of turning South Africa into a country of separate\nhomelands, as Verwoerd had planned. He also agreed to allow a Commonwealth\nnegotiating team, the Eminent Persons Group, to visit South Africa as part of a\nmission to promote a dialogue between the government and black political\nleaders, including Mandela and ANC officials in exile.\n\nThe circumstances of Mandela\u2019s imprisonment now began to change. In\nNovember , he had been admitted to the Volks Hospital in Cape Town for\nsurgery on an enlarged prostate gland. While recuperating from the operation, in\na tightly guarded section of the hospital, he had received an unexpected visitor:\nthe prisons minister, Kobie Coetsee. By chance, on the day before the operation,\nCoetsee had boarded the same flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town as\nWinnie, who was on her way to see Mandela in hospital. Coetsee had stopped by\nher seat in the economy section to assure her of the government\u2019s concern for\nher husband\u2019s health and later, during the flight, Winnie had marched through to\nthe first-class section to talk to him. As a result of this encounter, Coetsee\ndecided to pay Mandela a visit.\nMandela was amazed by the visit, but immediately took command of the\nsituation, introducing Coetsee and the commissioner of prisons, General Johan\nWillemse, who was with him, to his nurses, inviting them to sit down, making\nsure they were comfortable and engaging in pleasantries. Coetsee was struck by\nhis natural dignity and ease of manner. Mandela, for his part, sensed a change of\natmosphere from previous meetings with government officials. Coetsee was\naltogether more gracious and cordial. Little of substance was discussed, but\nCoetsee hinted that he was looking for a way to put Mandela \u2018in a situation\nbetween prison and freedom\u2019.\nUpon leaving hospital in December, Mandela was told that he would not be\nrejoining his colleagues on the top floor at Pollsmoor but given separate quarters\non the ground floor of a separate wing. His new quarters consisted of a large\nmain room, comfortably furnished, with a private bathroom next door, and two\nother rooms, one for exercise and the other for study. Mandela was not happy to\nbe separated from his colleagues. To meet with them henceforth, he had to put in\nan official request. But he realised that his new circumstances facilitated the\n\n\fpossibility of discussions with the government, an objective he had always held.\nHe also realised that his ANC colleagues would fear that, in isolation, he might\nbe tricked into making a deal with the government which they could not support.\nHe therefore asked George Bizos, his lawyer and friend, to fly to Lusaka to\nassure Tambo he would take no decisions without their approval. He wrote twice\nto Coetsee proposing talks, but was disheartened to receive no reply. He spent\nhis days listening avidly to radio news broadcasts, devouring newspapers,\nexercising hard and continuing his studies, waiting for some signal from the\noutside world.\nThe opportunity for talks came not from the government but from the\nCommonwealth Eminent Persons Group. In early , the Commonwealth\nnegotiators, led by General Obasanjo, a former military leader of Nigeria, and\nMalcolm Fraser, a former Australian prime minister, began shuttling around\nsouthern Africa, endeavouring to find a common basis for negotiation between\nthe South African government and the ANC. After some hesitation, Botha\nagreed to let Obasanjo meet Mandela in February and then for the group of\nseven to see him in March and then in May.\nThe prison authorities made sure that Mandela was well turned out for the\noccasion. A tailor was summoned to take his measurements for a new pin-stripe\nsuit. He was also given a shirt, tie, underwear, shoes and socks. The prison\ncommander, Brigadier Munro, inspected the result. \u2018Mandela,\u2019 he said, \u2018you\nlook more like a prime minister now, not a prisoner.\u2019\nWhen they met him at Pollsmoor\u2019s guest house, the Commonwealth team\nwere equally impressed. \u2018We were first struck by his physical authority\u2014by his\nimmaculate appearance, his apparent good health, and his commanding\npresence,\u2019 they reported. \u2018In his manner he exuded authority and received the\nrespect of all around him, including his jailers.\u2019\nAt the start of their second meeting, both Coetsee and Willemse put in an\nappearance. Mandela urged them to stay to listen to the discussion. He had\nnothing to hide from them, he said. If only the government and the ANC could\nsit down and talk, some of the differences between them which arose solely\nthrough a lack of contact could be eliminated. The fact of talking was essential\nin the building of mutual confidence. But the two men went away.\nMandela expounded at length on his hopes for a multiracial democracy in\nSouth Africa. He acknowledged the fears that whites held about majority rule\n\n\fand stressed the importance of providing minority groups with a real sense of\nsecurity. He emphasised that he was a nationalist, not a communist, whose\nprinciples were unchanged from those to which he subscribed when the Freedom\nCharter was drawn up in .\nHe was questioned extensively on the issue of violence. Mandela explained\nthat he was not yet in a position to renounce violence, but stressed that violence\ncould never provide an ultimate solution to South Africa\u2019s problems; only\nnegotiations could. The Commonwealth team found him \u2018reasonable and\nconciliatory\u2019. They planned one further meeting with him before concluding\ntheir assignment.\nBotha, however, was becoming impatient with the whole process. During the\ncourse of their endeavours, the Commonwealth team had drawn up a \u2018possible\nnegotiating concept\u2019 which went far beyond anything he was willing to\ncontemplate. In exchange for a commitment from the ANC to suspend violence\nand enter into negotiation, the South African government would have to release\nMandela and other political prisoners and detainees, withdraw the military from\nthe townships, lift the ban on the ANC and the PAC, suspend detention without\ntrial and permit normal political activity. Botha had held back from terminating\nthe whole exercise only because of the threat of further sanctions.\nYet Botha was also faced with signs of a growing white backlash. Opinion\npolls and parliamentary by-elections showed a clear resurgence of support for\nextreme right-wing parties which accused the government of dealing leniently\nwith township unrest for fear of offending foreign opinion. Added to fears about\nblack unrest and the government\u2019s failure to suppress it, there was deep alarm\nabout how far the government was prepared to go with its reform programme. A\nchance remark by the verligte foreign minister, Pik Botha, that he could foresee\ncircumstances in which South Africa might one day have a black president, sent\na shockwave through the white community. Botha denied any such notion, but\nthe damage was done. National Party officials reported mass defections to rightwing parties.\nBlack activists meanwhile, convinced that they had the government on the\nrun, were becoming ever more defiant. Black leaders predicted the government\u2019s\ndownfall. The ANC in exile declared  to be the \u2018Year of Umkhonto we\nSizwe\u2019 and talked of \u2018turning every corner of our country into a battlefield\u2019. In\nscores of townships across the country, the tide of black militancy was thought\n\n\fto be unstoppable. On May Day, workers and students staged a nationwide\nstrike, the largest anti-apartheid protest in South Africa\u2019s history. An even larger\nthree-day general strike was planned for  June to mark the tenth anniversary of\nthe Soweto uprising.\nUnder pressure from every quarter, Botha reacted impetuously with a display\nof belligerence and ill-temper that brought upon him universal condemnation.\nOn  May, the day the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group was due to\nmeet cabinet ministers, Botha ordered air strikes against targets in three\nneighbouring capital cities, Lusaka, Harare and Gaborone, claiming that they\nwere ANC bases. In parliament subsequently he bragged that the raids were just\na \u2018first instalment\u2019 and that they showed \u2018South Africa has the capacity and the\nwill to break the ANC\u2019. The Commonwealth team immediately cut short its\nmission.\nNext Botha ordered outright repression of all black opposition. Under a\nnationwide state of emergency declared on  June, the security forces set out to\ndecapitate all black resistance through mass arrests and tight control of township\nactivity. The army surrounded whole townships and moved into schools. Prisons\nwere soon filled with community leaders, trade unionists, church workers,\nstudents and other anti-apartheid activists. Strict censorship was imposed on the\nmedia, prohibiting all but official information on security force activities and\nblack resistance. Defending his proclamation of a state of emergency, Botha\nclaimed he faced a choice akin to that \u2018between war and a dishonourable, fearful\npeace\u2019. He acknowledged that there would be a price to pay in terms of\nsanctions. But he declared that South Africa would not \u2018crawl before anyone\u2019 to\navert the threat of sanctions and was quite prepared to \u2018go it alone\u2019.\n\nDespite the repression, Mandela was determined to find a way out of the\ndeadlock. Soon after the state of emergency was declared, he wrote a note to\nGeneral Willemse saying he wanted to see him on a matter of national\nimportance. Willemse responded by arranging to meet Mandela in his residence\nin the grounds of Pollsmoor a few days later. When they met, Mandela told\nWillemse he wanted to see Kobie Coetsee to raise the question of talks between\nthe government and the ANC. Then and there, Willemse telephoned Coetsee at\nhis official residence in Cape Town and was told to bring Mandela around\nimmediately for a meeting. Within minutes Mandela was on his way to\n\n\fSavernake, Coetsee\u2019s residence, eight miles away. Coetsee welcomed him with a\nglass of sherry and apologised that he had not been given a chance to change out\nof his prison clothes. To Mandela, the sherry, his first drink in twenty-four years,\nwas like nectar.\nTheir discussion lasted for three hours. Mandela found Coetsee both\nknowledgeable about the central issues involved and willing to listen. He asked\nMandela under what circumstances the ANC would be willing to suspend its\narmed struggle and whether he envisioned constitutional guarantees for\nminorities in a future South Africa. The two men, both lawyers, formed a liking\nfor each other which was to endure for many years. Towards the end of their\ndiscussion, Coetsee asked what the next step was. Mandela replied that he\nwanted a meeting with Botha. Coetsee made a note of this and said he would\nsend his request through the appropriate channels. They parted on good terms.\nMandela told no one of this encounter, neither his colleagues in Polls moor\nnor those in exile in Lusaka. He wanted the talks process to gain some\nmomentum before disclosing that it was under way. But, to his frustration, he\nheard nothing more for months from Coetsee. He wrote him a letter but received\nno reply.\nThe difficulty was President Botha. He had been informed about Coetsee\u2019s\ndiscussion with Mandela and was willing to allow Coetsee to stay in touch with\nhim. But his interest in Mandela was limited to finding ways and means of\nreleasing him from prison, and he had no intention of engaging in talks about\npolitical change. Botha had reached the limits of his reform programme. He\nbelieved that the reforms he had introduced to South Africa were of major\nimportance and yet had earned him little credit, either at home or abroad. He\ncertainly had no intention of contemplating the idea of talks with the ANC. In\nhis view the ANC was an organisation under communist control, bent on\ndestroying white civilisation. It was at the centre of the \u2018total onslaught\u2019 the\ncountry was facing. Its links with the Soviet Union and other communist states,\nthe support it received from Marxist regimes in Mozambique and Angola, and,\nabove all, its alliance with the South African Communist Party were all cited by\nBotha as evidence of the ANC\u2019s true nature. The only answer to this \u2018total\nonslaught\u2019 was \u2018total strategy\u2019 and with this the government was already\nsucceeding.\nFor the rest of his term of office, Botha concentrated more and more power in\n\n\fthe hands of his security officials. A complex web of committees was\nconstructed to give the State Security Council direct control over a vast range of\ngovernment activity. The security network covered the entire country, reaching\ndown to every level of society and designed to meet any contingency. Specialist\nteams were set to work on every subject, from manpower and transport to\ncultural affairs and community services. The underlying belief was that\neconomic welfare and social improvements would win the hearts and minds of\nthe local population. As the defence minister, Magnus Malan, caustically\nremarked, once blacks had toilets, they would not want democracy. To ensure\nmore effective control of the townships, the government coopted allies in the\nblack community\u2014councillors, policemen, businessmen, traders and vigilante\ngroups\u2014providing them with the means necessary to defend their position\nagainst radical activists. In the war against \u2018enemies of the state\u2019, all methods,\nincluding assas - sination, were considered by security officials to be legitimate.\nAt a meeting of the State Security Council in February , Botha, impressed\nby a magazine article he had read about a \u2018third force\u2019 operating against the\nMafia in Italy, suggested the need for a similar \u2018third force\u2019 in South Africa \u2018to\ncombat terrorism and unrest\u2019.\nThe state of emergency, meanwhile, effectively crippled organised black\nopposition. With thousands of activists in detention, opposition groups fell into\ndisarray. Youth organisations, once at the forefront of the township revolt, lost\nall vigour. The UDF was reduced to a mere shadow of its former self. After two\nyears of bitter conflict, the black opposition movement had proved to be no\nmatch for a government armed with totalitarian powers and prepared to use\nthem.\nBotha\u2019s tough, aggressive posture on security found ready support from the\nwhite electorate. In the  election, he succeeded in holding on to his twothirds majority in parliament. But what the result also showed was a massive\nlurch to the right. The extreme right wing picked up nearly  per cent of the\nvote. In all, more than  per cent of the white electorate voted for right-wing or\nextreme right-wing parties which rejected all notion of fundamental change to\nthe apart - heid system. Liberal opposition parties fared badly. Political debate\nhenceforth was conducted more in terms of right-wing demands to curb reform\nthan liberal demands to increase it. All this served to reinforce Botha\u2019s\ndetermination to hold firm.\nYet even within the heart of the Afrikaner establishment, there were critics of\n\n\fBotha\u2019s kragdadigheid approach who believed that it had no long-term future.\nOne of them was Pieter de Lange, chairman of the Broederbond, which had\nplayed a highly influential role in Afrikaner nationalist politics since the s.\nDe Lange embarked on a personal campaign to convince Afrikaners of the need\nfor fundamental changes conceding political rights to the black population and\nestablished his own contacts with ANC officials in exile in . Other groups\ntoo\u2014opposition politicians, churchmen and academics\u2014found their way to\nLusaka and Harare for meetings with the ANC. Botha, meanwhile, denounced\nall such contacts and did his best to obstruct them. A group of respected Dutch\nReformed Church clergymen who wanted to talk to the ANC he branded as\n\u2018na\u00efve\u2019 and \u2018childish\u2019 and threatened to confiscate their passports.\n\nEven though Mandela heard nothing from Coetsee for months on end, there were\nsigns that the government was planning a different role for him. On Christmas\nEve in , he was given his first taste of freedom outside prison in twenty-four\nyears. After breakfast, the deputy commander of Pollsmoor, Lieutenant-Colonel\nGawie Marx, called by his cell to ask whether he would like to see something of\nCape Town. Together they drove along the coast road to Cape Town and\nmeandered in the car through its streets. Mandela was riveted, watching the\nordinary activities of people out shopping, walking their dogs, sitting in the sun:\n\u2018I felt like a curious tourist in a strange land.\u2019 On the way back to the prison,\nMarx asked Mandela if he would like a cold drink and stopped the car at a caf\u00e9:\n\u2018He just left me there, sitting alone in the car with the keys in the ignition.\u2019 As he\nwaited for Marx to return, Mandela became more and more agitated and intense,\nwondering whether he should try to make a run for it, and was greatly relieved\nwhen Marx reappeared.\nOther trips were arranged for him. He was taken to coastal resorts and fishing\nvillages, to the mountains and inland to the edge of the Great Karoo. He walked\non beaches, took tea in caf\u00e9s and ate fish and chips. Once he visited the home of\none of his warders, meeting his wife and children. Only a handful of trusted\nprison staff and guards knew of these secret journeys. No word of them leaked\nout. Nor was he ever recognised in public. No photograph of him had been\nallowed to be published in South Africa since his imprisonment. The last\nphotographs taken of him in the s, for anyone who could remember, showed\na heavily built middle-aged man. Now he was a lean, grey-haired, elderly figure,\nwith creases and furrows etched on his face and a slightly fragile air.\n\n\fHe also spent hours whiling away the time in vegetable gardens at the\nsouthern edge of the prison grounds in the company of his warder, James\nGregory. Together they would sit in the lush, long grass on the banks of a small\nreservoir, watching the flights of wild geese and ducks and reminiscing about\ntheir childhoods and their families. Mandela took a close interest in Gregory\u2019s\nfamily. \u2018It was not merely politeness but genuine interest,\u2019 said Gregory. \u2018He\nwas genuinely concerned for people, all people, and when he asked about their\nwelfare, he took time to listen. It was not just a polite refrain.\u2019 When Gregory\u2019s\nson, Brent, joined the staff at Pollsmoor, he was astonished when Mandela\ngreeted him as a friend, saying he had known all about him since his schooldays.\n\u2018It was like meeting an uncle for the first time,\u2019 said Brent.\nIn , Coetsee resumed his secret discussions with Mandela, seeking a\nformula that would enable the government to grant him an \u2018honourable release\u2019.\nBy publicly requiring Mandela to renounce violence, Botha had made the task\nmore difficult. Having taken such a firm stand, he would only appear weak if he\nsubsequently released Mandela unconditionally, and Botha was a man obsessed\nby the need to appear tough and in control. \u2018He wanted this thing to be done. He\nknew it had to be done,\u2019 recalled Coetsee, \u2018but he didn\u2019t want to appear weak.\u2019\nMandela, however, had no interest in negotiating his own release unless it was\npart of a package of measures including the lifting of the ban on the ANC. As he\nhad made clear when first rejecting Botha\u2019s conditional offer of release, there\nwas no point in being freed if he was not then free to engage in political activity.\nHe continued to press for a meeting with Botha. He was also concerned to secure\nthe release of his older colleagues, including Sisulu, who was seventy-five, and\nMbeki, who was seventy-seven, and asked for Coetsee\u2019s help in this matter.\nBy , the government had decided to take the discussions with Mandela a\nstage further. A secret committee was formed to explore the political issues that\nMandela had long wanted to raise. It was headed by Coetsee and included two\nsenior officials in the prisons department, General Willemse, the commissioner,\nand Fanie van der Merwe, the director-general, providing the meetings with the\nostensible cover, if any word leaked out, that they were concerned with no more\nthan discussions about prison conditions.\nThe presence of the fourth member of the committee, Niel Barnard, however,\nsignified their true importance. Barnard, a thirty seven-year-old former\nacademic, was the head of Botha\u2019s National Intelligence Service, a member of\n\n\fthe inner circle of his advisers. He was an ardent Afrikaner nationalist and a\ncommitted supporter of the \u2018total onslaught\u2019 school, but he took a pragmatic\nview of the government\u2019s options. Along with other senior government officials,\nhe believed that splits could be found within the ANC between nationalists and\ncommunists which the government would be able to exploit to its advantage,\nopening the possibility of an accommodation with moderate nationalists. As well\nas the \u2018Mandela initiative\u2019, Barnard was monitoring secret talks which had\nbegun in England in October  between a number of prominent Afrikaners\nand ANC officials in exile.\nBefore agreeing to attend the first meeting of the committee, Mandela decided\nto consult his colleagues on the third floor. He was less than frank in what he\ntold them. Meeting them one by one, at the insistence of the prison authorities,\nhe gave them no idea of the extent of his talks with Coetsee which had begun\ntwo years previously. Nor did he reveal that the government had set up a special\ncommittee to handle the talks which included Botha\u2019s intelligence chief.\nSisulu, his oldest friend and mentor, was highly sceptical about the idea of\ntalks. \u2018I was not against negotiations in principle,\u2019 he recalled. \u2018But I would have\npreferred the government to take the initiative to talk to us rather than our\ninitiating talks with them.\u2019 Mandela retorted that if he was not against the\nprinciple of negotiations, it did not matter who took the initiative. Realising that\nMandela had already made up his mind, he did not try to stand in his way. Years\nlater Sisulu acknowledged, \u2018I would have hesitated. I would have wanted certain\nthings done. I might have lost the chance.\u2019 Kathrada was even more adamant in\nhis opposition. By initiating talks, he said, it would appear that they were\ncapitulating. Only Mhlaba and Mlangeni were in favour.\nMandela was no more forthcoming with Tambo. When Tambo asked, in a\nmessage conveyed by Bizos, what it was that he was talking to the government\nabout, Mandela sent only a terse reply, giving no detail. His colleagues,\nmeanwhile, feared that in isolation from the other prisoners, he would misjudge\nevents and compromise the struggle. Many of them were averse to any idea of\ndialogue. \u2018I knew it would be opposed by our own people as well as those on the\ngovernment side,\u2019 Mandela said. What he wanted was to present his ANC\ncolleagues with the fait accompli of a dialogue before any of them could disrupt\nit.\nThe first meeting of the committee was held in May  in the office of the\n\n\fprison commander at Pollsmoor. It was a tense occasion, with much suspicion on\nboth sides. Mandela had never met Barnard before. Barnard was conscious of the\nfact that in Mandela\u2019s eyes he was \u2018a youngster\u2019, half Mandela\u2019s age. The\nsecond meeting, which took place at Willemse\u2019s house, over sherry and supper,\nwas more relaxed. To put Barnard at ease, Mandela always greeted him in\nAfrikaans and allowed him to conduct his side of the talks in Afrikaans.\nSubsequent meetings occurred regularly, almost every week.\nOnce the preliminary discussions were over, the talks centred on three main\nissues: the armed struggle, the ANC\u2019s alliance with the Communist Party and the\nquestion of majority rule. The government representatives insisted that the ANC\nwould have to renounce violence before the government would agree to\nnegotiations and before Mandela would be allowed to meet Botha. The\ngovernment\u2019s position had always been clear: it would not negotiate with any\norganisation involved in violence. To change its position now would involve a\nloss of credibility. Mandela\u2019s reply was that if the government adopted peaceful\nmethods, so would the ANC.\nThey were equally adamant that the ANC would have to sever its link with the\nCommunist Party before negotiations could begin. The Communist Party, they\nmaintained, dominated and controlled the ANC. No progress could be made\nuntil the link was broken. Mandela explained at length the reason behind the\nalliance. They had similar aims in overthrowing apartheid, but different longterm interests. No move would be made to break the alliance merely because the\ngovernment wanted it to end.\nThe government side was also sceptical about the fate of the white minority\nunder majority rule. Their interests, they suggested, would be trampled on. They\nquestioned Mandela on what protection for minorities the ANC would offer.\nMandela referred them to the Freedom Charter, which stated that South Africa\nbelonged to all who lived in it, black and white, and tried to reassure them that in\nany future dispensation the majority would depend heavily on the skills and\nexperience of the whites.\nMandela\u2019s grasp of the issues and, in particular, his knowledge and\nunderstanding of the Afrikaner people greatly impressed those present. Mandela\nknew \u2018more about the Afrikaners\u2019 history than many Afrikaners themselves,\u2019\nrecalled Coetsee. Yet the questions, and the answers, soon became repetitive. As\nMandela\u2019s seventieth birthday passed by in July\u2014marked by a huge festival\n\n\fconcert in London but by no particular celebration in Pollsmoor\u2014he became\nincreasingly restless. \u2018You don\u2019t have the power,\u2019 he told Barnard. \u2018I want to\ntalk to the man with the power, and that is P. W. Botha. I want to talk to him.\u2019\nOn the basis of these secret sessions, Coetsee and Barnard succeeded in\npersuading Botha to agree to a meeting. \u2018I spent an hour with him telling him\nthere was no way he could lose out if he saw Mandela,\u2019 Barnard recalled. \u2018\u201cIf\nthe meeting goes wrong and jumps the tracks and all that,\u201d I said, \u201cyou will still\nbe remembered as the one who tried to keep things moving forward to a\nsolution. But if it goes well it will be the beginning of South Africa\u2019s settlement\npolitics, and history will acknowledge you for that.\u201d\u2019 The meeting was arranged\nfor the end of August .\nYet to Mandela\u2019s immense frustration, he fell ill. A persistent cough had\ntroubled him for some weeks. Just before a meeting with one of his lawyers,\nIsmail Ayob, at the end of July, he began to vomit. At first, doctors diagnosed\nflu, aggravated by dampness in his ground-floor rooms, but Mandela continued\nto feel sick. On  August, he was taken to Tygerberg Hospital near Cape Town,\nwhere he was found to have tuberculosis. He immediately underwent an\noperation to remove fluid from his lungs. Because the tuberculosis had been\narrested at an early stage, no long-term damage was likely and Mandela\nrecovered more quickly than expected. But the prized meeting with Botha, for\nwhich he had striven for more than two years, had to be postponed.\nIn September, he was moved to a luxury private clinic, the Constantiaberg,\nnear Pollsmoor, the first black patient ever to stay there. His meetings with\nCoetsee and the secret committee resumed. Then in December he was taken to a\nnew location, the Victor Verster prison-farm near Paarl, in the heartland of the\nCape wine-growing district, thirty-five miles from Cape Town\u2014a place intended\nto be half-way between prison and freedom.\nThe house he was given was the most spacious and comfortable home in\nwhich he had ever lived. A whitewashed single-storey residence, it stood in an\nisolated part of the farm, at the end of a winding dirt road, shaded by tall fir trees\nand surrounded by fields and a wood. It contained a large lounge and four\nbedrooms, with a garden full of flowers and fruit trees and a swimming pool, all\nenclosed behind a high wall.\nThe keys were left in the doors for Mandela to use as he chose. The cupboards\nwere stocked with provisions, wines and spirits, courtesy of the government. On\n\n\fhand to greet him was the prison commander, Brigadier Keulder, who told him\nthat if he needed anything, he just had to ask. The following day, Coetsee arrived\nwith a crate of wine as a housewarming gift. The prison staff assigned to him\nincluded James Gregory, whom he had known for twenty-two years and whom\nhe regarded as a friend, and Jack Swart, a warrant officer who served as his\npersonal chef, providing him with whatever meals and delicacies he fancied.\nMandela particularly enjoyed Swart\u2019s homemade ginger beer. Gregory\u2019s son,\nBrent, was also a member of the staff.\nMandela soon settled into a comfortable routine. Each morning, he was\nexamined by a doctor. He toured the garden, taking a proprietorial interest in the\nplants. He tried out the swimming pool. Ignoring protests from his household\nstaff, he insisted on making his own bed and on doing his share of washing the\ndishes. He finally succeeded in passing his law degree. He watched television.\nHe entertained his lawyers and members of his family in style. His four\ncomrades from Pollsmoor paid him a visit, Sisulu marvelling at his \u2018five-star\nhotel\u2019 conditions \u2018complete with room service\u2019. On Christmas Day in ,\nWinnie, Zindzi and Zindzi\u2019s two children came for the day, the first proper\nfamily gathering Mandela had enjoyed in twenty-six years.\nBut as for his main immediate objective of opening a dialogue with Botha, he\nmade no further progress. In January, the seventy-three-year-old president\nsuffered a stroke and once again, the meeting had to be rescheduled. And then\nthe sense of tranquillity he had just begun to experience was disrupted by a\nmassive scandal involving Winnie with which he had to contend.",
    "1988-1994": " THE FOOTBALL CLUB\nAFTER A SERIES OF ALTERCATIONS WITH POLICE, ARRESTS AND\nCOURT appearances, Winnie eventually succeeded in  in re-establishing\nher right to live in Soweto, nearly nine years after her banishment to Brandfort.\nHer battle to stay in Johannesburg, in defiance of government banning orders,\nattracted worldwide attention. As the result of one arrest, in December ,\nwhen she was dragged from her Orlando home \u2018kicking and screaming\u2019,\naccording to eyewitnesses, governments in Britain, the United States and France\nissued strong protests. A posse of journalists and television crews followed her\nabout, waiting for the next encounter. Winnie relished the attention she received.\nWith the township revolt then in full swing, she endeavoured to play a leading\nrole as a militant activist. She attended funeral rallies, making speeches which\nbecame ever more extreme, gaining for herself a loyal following among black\nyouths. A speech she made at a rally in Munsieville in April  which\nendorsed the necklace method of killing, by which several hundred victims had\ndied, brought her lasting notoriety. \u2018We have no guns, we have only stones,\nboxes of matches and petrol,\u2019 she said. \u2018Together, hand in hand, with our boxes\nof matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country.\u2019\nThe damage that Winnie did to the African nationalist cause by those words\nwas considerable. Necklace murders had become a symbol to much of the world\nof the anarchic black-on-black violence afflicting the townships which the\ngovernment was eager to claim was all that lay behind the black revolt. The clear\nimplication of Winnie\u2019s speech was that she not only supported such methods\nbut also advocated that whites too should be burnt.\nThe ANC in exile, anxious to prove to Western governments that it was not a\n\u2018terrorist\u2019 organisation, as leaders like Britain\u2019s Margaret Thatcher maintained,\nwere appalled. Messages were sent to Winnie telling her to refrain from any\nmore speechmaking. In Pollsmoor, Mandela was furious and summoned her for\nan angry reprimand. But Winnie was not inclined to take orders from anyone and\n\n\fher activities became even more rash and ruthless.\nShe gathered around her a group of township youths who became known as\nthe Mandela United Football Club. Forming football teams in the name of\npopular political leaders was a fashionable pursuit at the time; a Sisulu Football\nClub already existed in Orlando. Winnie allowed them to stay in rooms at the\nback of her Orlando house and provided them with track suits and money. She\nacquired a \u2018coach\u2019, a thirty-eight-year-old local man named Jerry Richardson, a\nskilled football player but someone with limited intelligence, a meagre education\nand a reputation as a police informer. Like other members of the group, he\nbecame dependent on Winnie, calling her \u2018Mummy\u2019 and functioning as her\nhenchman. Zindzi too was involved in Mandela United, sometimes playing the\nrole of \u2018mascot\u2019; two of her boy-friends were leading members.\nFrom its origins as a football club, Mandela United rapidly descended into a\nworld of brutal crime. Winnie used it initially as a personal bodyguard, to\naccompany her to rallies and funerals and to guard her house. Its members were\nsubject to her own strict rules. They were required to return home by a certain\ntime each night, signing in and out of the house in a special register. Failure to\nsign the register meant a whipping, from Winnie as well as from other youths.\nLooking for more recruits, club members roamed the township, accusing those\nwho did not want to join them of being police informers or \u2018sell-outs\u2019. Many\nwho were coerced into joining subsequently found it difficult to leave. No one\ncould resign voluntarily from the club. Stories began to circulate of youths being\ntaken to Winnie\u2019s house and never seen again.\nMandela United soon began operating as a vigilante gang. Victims accused of\ntheft and other crimes or of being police informers were brought to Winnie\u2019s\nhouse for interrogation by a \u2018disciplinary committee\u2019 and for whatever\npunishment it decided to order. The head of the disciplinary committee for some\ntime was Sizwe Sithole, the father of one of Zindzi\u2019s children. Punishment\nvaried according to the offence, but included kicking, punching, whipping and\nbeating. A favourite form of punishment was known as \u2018breakdown\u2019, in which\nvictims were thrown high into the air and left to hit the floor. Other forms of\ntorture were also used.\nIn May , a teenage youth, Peter Makanda, was abducted, along with his\nbrother, by members of Mandela United, who accused them of being informers.\nThey were taken to Winnie\u2019s house and savagely beaten. Makanda was hung by\n\n\fthe neck with a plastic rope from a rafter until it broke; his head was placed in a\nplastic bag and his face was pushed into a bucket of water. Both brothers were\nthen tortured with knives. A large \u2018M\u2019 for Mandela was carved on Makanda\u2019s\nchest and the words \u2018Viva ANC\u2019 sliced down the length of one of his thighs.\nBattery acid was smeared into the wounds. The brothers claimed that Winnie put\nin an appearance soon after they were first beaten, returning a few hours\nafterwards. They later managed to escape from a garage, but others were not so\nfortunate. Subsequent evidence linked Mandela United to eight known murders\nof local residents, mostly teenagers.\nThe activities of Mandela United were an evil mess that no one was anxious to\ndeal with. The fear of reprisal deterred many families from making complaints.\nParents who suspected that Mandela United were responsible for the\ndisappearance of their children never had any proof as no bodies were ever\nfound. The police were not keen to be seen persecuting Winnie any more. The\nactivities of her gang of vigilantes were no different from those of scores of\nothers which had sprung up during the township revolt. Kangaroo courts, like the\none she was running at no. , Orlando West, were relatively common.\nWhen the Makanda brothers reported their ordeal to the police, three members\nof Mandela United were arrested. But Winnie herself was never charged in\nconnection with the crime; nor was she called as a witness or even questioned.\nBlack political leaders were no keener to confront the problem of Winnie\u2019s\ncriminal behaviour. She thus enjoyed a kind of immunity which not only\ninduced greater fear of her but increased her sense of her own power. She\nseemed untouchable.\nOnly murmurs of these events reached Mandela in Pollsmoor. Neither the\nlocal nor the foreign press delved into Winnie\u2019s increasingly wayward activities\nfor fear that their reports would be used by the government for propaganda\npurposes and serve only to discredit the anti-apartheid struggle. They were also\nconcerned that rumours about Winnie and Mandela United might have been\nmanufactured by the government in the first place. Friends and lawyers visiting\nMandela were careful not to draw attention to Winnie\u2019s conduct or to her heavy\ndrinking to avoid alarming him.\nBut other embarrassments involving Winnie surfaced. Within a year of\nreturning to Soweto, she ordered the construction of a mansion in an exclusive\narea known as Beverly Hills, where a black elite of businessmen, lawyers, and\n\n\fdoctors lived. By Soweto standards, the house, containing fifteen rooms, was\nvast. Known as \u2018Winnie\u2019s Palace\u2019, it attracted hostile criticism from the local\ncommunity. It hardly fitted the revolutionary image that Winnie was attempting\nto establish. Where the money came from was something of a mystery. While\nspending large sums on clothes, cars and her bodyguard, Winnie always pleaded\npoverty.\nSome funds came as a result of a business relationship struck up with a black\nAmerican entrepreneur, Robert Brown, which led to yet another scandal. Brown\nwas a former civil rights campaigner who switched his attention to South Africa\nand began to raise substantial funds in the United States for the anti-apartheid\ncause. He soon realised that there was a fortune to be made from the Mandela\nfamily. In collaboration with Winnie, he proposed to copyright and market the\nMandela name and prevent others from cashing in on it. Their negotiations had\njust reached an amicable conclusion when an incident involving Mandela United\nsuddenly erupted, focusing public attention on its activities.\nOn  July , a crowd of teenage pupils from the Daliwonga High School\nmarched on Winnie\u2019s house, smashed the doors and windows and then set fire to\nit. The attack was part of a running feud between them and Mandela United,\nmade in revenge for the detention of a group of Daliwonga students who had\nbeen accused of rape, found guilty and then beaten up in the back rooms of\nWinnie\u2019s house.\nAll the Mandela family records, their photographs, letters and gifts, and even\nthe slice of wedding cake that Winnie had been saving for Mandela\u2019s release,\nwere destroyed in the fire. As local residents gathered in the street, none of them\nventured to help. They watched in silence as the house burned down.\nWinnie appeared to be devastated by the attack. With the street full of people,\nshe drove slowly towards the burning house, saw what had happened and went\naway. At her office in Soweto, friends found her in a state of shock. Robert\nBrown was there, full of self-importance, trying to dictate who would be allowed\nto see her. Members of Mandela United had barricaded the building. To her old\nfriend Amina Cachalia, Winnie said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what is happening to my\nlife.\u2019\nAccompanied by Brown, Winnie flew to Cape Town shortly afterwards to see\nMandela, both to tell him of the arson attack and to get his approval for the deal\nwith Brown. Mandela had been forewarned by his lawyer, Ismail Ayob, about\n\n\fBrown\u2019s attempt to control the Mandela name and he had been outraged. He told\nWinnie that he would have nothing to do with the scheme and authorised a\nstatement disclaiming any connection with Brown. \u2018If the family name needed\nprotection it could be protected by the African National Congress,\u2019 his statement\nsaid.\nHe also told Winnie to disband her \u2018football team\u2019 and decided not to press\ncharges against the Daliwonga students. To limit further damage, he asked a\ngroup of influential community leaders, including the Reverend Frank Chikane\nof the South African Council of Churches, Cyril Ramaphosa, a prominent trade\nunionist, and Aubrey Mokoena of the Release Mandela Committee, to form a\n\u2018crisis committee\u2019 to take control of the matter. The burden of these events\nadded to the exhaustion that Mandela was already feeling as a result of his\ntuberculosis, which had still to be diagnosed. Shortly afterwards, he collapsed\nand was taken to Tygerberg Hospital.\nBut Winnie refused to disband Mandela United. While the house in Orlando\nwas being rebuilt, she moved into a house in Diepkloof Extension in another part\nof Soweto, taking members of Mandela United with her. It was not long before\nthey resumed their murderous activities.\nTwo incidents became notorious. In November , a gunfight erupted\nbetween police and two MK guerrillas who were hiding in Jerry Richardson\u2019s\nhouse in Soweto. Richardson had been asked by Winnie to give them temporary\nshelter. Just before the shooting started, Richardson, who was in the garden,\nraised his arms in the air and surrendered to the police. The two guerrillas were\nkilled. Richardson was detained for two weeks but then released. He was already\nsuspected in the local community of being a police informer. The shooting of the\ntwo guerrillas further increased local suspicion.\nMembers of Mandela United singled out for retribution two local youths, Lolo\nSono and Siboniso Tshabalala, who had been friendly with the guerrillas and\nwho had been seen at Richardson\u2019s house shortly before the gunfight started.\nSummoned to Winnie\u2019s house, Sono was savagely beaten. Battered and\nbleeding, he was then taken by Winnie and other club members in a minibus to\nhis parent\u2019s home. According to Sono\u2019s father, Winnie accused the youth of\nbeing a police spy. The father denied it and pleaded with Winnie to let the boy\ngo, but she refused and drove away with him. Neither Lolo Sono nor Siboniso\nTshabalala were seen again. The police were informed of the incident, but took\n\n\fno action.\nThe second incident, however, the death of a fourteen-year-old boy named\n\u2018Stompie\u2019 Moeketsi Seipei, finally ensnared Winnie. This time, by chance, a\nbody was found and witnesses eventually came forward.\nStompie was an obstreperous and boastful youth who had gained a reputation\nfor being both a fervent activist, able to cite the Freedom Charter by heart, and a\npolice informer who had \u2018cracked\u2019 in detention. Along with other homeless\nyouths, he had found lodgings in a church manse in Orlando East run by a white\nMethodist minister, Paul Verryn, who was highly respected in the\nneighbourhood for his commitment in helping the local community. The manse,\nwith only three bedrooms, was always overcrowded; on some nights as many as\nforty people stayed there.\nOn  December , shortly after Winnie returned home from her\nChristmas visit to Mandela in Victor Verster prison, she ordered the abduction of\nfour occupants of the Methodist manse, including Stompie, after being told by\nanother occupant, Xoliswa Falati, a troublesome thirty-five-year-old woman who\nhad quarrelled with Stompie and with Verryn, that Verryn had engaged in\nhomosexual practices at the manse. The victims were brought to Winnie\u2019s house\nat Diepkloof Extension and there, according to the three survivors, Falati\nrepeated her accusations about homosexuality and claimed that Stompie was an\ninformer. All four were then interrogated and beaten mercilessly to extract\nconfessions. Winnie, who had been drinking and who was in a foul mood, was\naccused of leading the assaults, punching and slapping each of the victims. \u2018You\nare not fit to be alive,\u2019 she told them. Members of Mandela United joined in,\nthrowing their victims into the air, shouting \u2018breakdown\u2019 as they did. Winnie,\naccording to one of the victims, Kenny Kgase, watched \u2018with a look of\nsatisfaction\u2019. She called for a sjambok\u2014a rawhide whip\u2014to be brought and,\nhumming a freedom song, lashed the victims. Stompie, deemed to be a \u2018sell-out\u2019,\ncame in for especially brutal treatment, and eventually he confessed to being a\npolice informer. The following day, he was beaten again and again. On \nJanuary, he was taken away.\nNews of the abductions quickly spread around Soweto. On  January, a\nmember of the crisis committee, Aubrey Mokoena, questioned Winnie about\nthem, but she denied that any of the youths were at her home. On  January,\nwhen Dr Nthatho Motlana, an old friend of the Mandela family, went to see\n\n\fWinnie, she admitted that they were at her home, but refused to allow him to see\nthem.\nThen, on  January, one of the kidnap victims, Kenny Kgase, managed to\nescape. He immediately alerted Methodist Church elders to what had happened\nto him and the three others. Led by Bishop Peter Storey, the Methodist Church\nnow became central in trying to free the missing youths, coordinating its efforts\nwith the crisis committee but avoiding contact with the police to minimise\ncomplications.\nOn  January, four members of the crisis committee went to Winnie\u2019s house.\nThis time she claimed that she was protecting the youths from Verryn and that\nthey were staying at her house at their own request. On the following day, when\nthe committee members were finally allowed to see the two remaining kidnap\nvictims, Pelo Mekgwe and Thabiso Mono, both of whom had clear injuries, they\nclaimed at first that they were staying at Winnie\u2019s house of their own free will.\nHowever, a club member, Katiza Cebekhulu, who had participated in the\nbeatings, told a different story. Finding himself alone with the committee\nmembers, he decided to confess his involvement. \u2018I am going to die anyway so I\nmay as well tell the truth.\u2019 Cebekhulu told the committee members that he\nbelieved that Stompie was dead, but they decided that it would not be \u2018prudent\u2019\nto confront Winnie at that stage.\nTo help resolve the issue, the Methodist Church and the crisis committee\nsought assistance from Oliver Tambo in Lusaka and from Mandela in Victor\nVerster. A human rights lawyer, Fink Haysom, was commissioned to fly to\nLusaka to brief Tambo. As he listened to Haysom\u2019s account, Tambo, appalled,\nthrew up his hands and covered his face. \u2018What must I do?\u2019 he exclaimed. \u2018We\ncan\u2019t control her. The ANC can\u2019t control her. We tried to control her, that\u2019s why\nwe formed the crisis committee. You must tell the crisis committee they must do\nmore!\u2019\nIn Victor Verster, after being informed of the details by Ismail Ayob on \nJanuary, Mandela issued an instruction that the two youths should be released.\nAfter further prevarication from Winnie, they were set free on  January and\nhanded over to Bishop Storey. There was, however, still no word of the\nwhereabouts of Stompie.\nHaving collected a considerable amount of evidence, the crisis committee\ndecided to call a meeting of community and church leaders in Soweto. This was\n\n\fduly held on the night of  January, shortly after Mekgwe and Mono had been\nreleased. Both of them attended, as did Kgase and Cebekhulu. Bishop Storey\nwas also there, together with Paul Verryn. In all, there were about \nparticipants. The meeting heard from Mekgwe and Mono how they had been\nabducted, taken to Winnie\u2019s house and beaten, first by her and then by club\nmembers. Cebekhulu confirmed their account of the beatings. When asked\nwhether Stompie was dead, Cebekhulu replied, \u2018Yes\u2019, but was unable to say\nwhere his body might be found. Storey asked the meeting at large if anyone\nknew of any misconduct on the part of Verryn. About a dozen residents from the\nmanse were present, but no one spoke against him.\nAnother victim of Mandela United, Lerotodi Ikaneng, a former member of the\nclub who had decided to quit despite being accused by Zindzi of being a \u2018sellout\u2019, described how, on  January, Jerry Richardson and other members of the\ngang had tried to murder him using a pair of garden shears, leaving him for dead;\nthe wound across his neck was still raw.\nOn the basis of the evidence it possessed, the crisis committee resolved that\nWinnie should be ostracised. It proposed that \u2018all progressive organisations\nshould no longer give her a platform\u2019; that she should \u2018desist from creating an\nimpression that she speaks on behalf of the people\u2019; that all \u2018progressive\nlawyers\u2019 should refrain from helping her any longer; and that she should be\nordered immediately to dismantle her football club. A report sent to Tambo in\nLusaka confirmed that Winnie had participated in the beatings at her house. It\nspoke of \u2018this new ghastly situation that is developing before our eyes\u2019, and\nadded, \u2018She seems to think that she is above the community. She shows utter\ncontempt for both the crisis committee and the community.\u2019 The committee\nended their report with a pitiful plea: \u2018Help us map out the way forward.\u2019\nThe crisis was to spread further. On  January, a popular Indian doctor, AbuBaker Asvat, was murdered in his surgery in Soweto. Asvat had been a close\nfriend of Winnie, always ready to respond to her requests for help. He was a\nprominent political activist involved not with pro-ANC organisations but with\nthe black consciousness movement. Members of his family had noticed in recent\nweeks that he had become increasingly troubled and anxious. Their first reaction\nto the murder was to assume that he had been killed for political reasons. But\nother possibilities soon emerged. The crisis committee knew that Asvat had been\ncalled to Winnie\u2019s house on  December to examine Stompie, whom he found\nto be brain-damaged. Asvat had subsequently reported his findings to the crisis\n\n\fcommittee. He was therefore a key witness to the circumstances surrounding\nStompie\u2019s disappearance. Asvat had also been involved in the case as a result of\na visit that Winnie had paid to his surgery, bringing with her Cebekhulu, who,\nafter joining in the assaults of the four kidnap victims, had become distraught.\nWinnie\u2019s explanation was that he had been sexually abused by Verryn. Asvat\nexamined Cebekhulu, found no evidence of sexual abuse, but noted on his\nmedical record that he was mentally confused and occasionally hysterical.\nAccording to the record book and the medical card completed in Asvat\u2019s\nsurgery, Winnie brought Cebekhulu to see him on  December, the day after\nthe abduction took place. The date in the record book was written by Asvat\u2019s\nnurse, Albertina Sisulu; the date on the card was stamped with a date stamp. This\nevidence of Winnie\u2019s whereabouts on  December was to assume considerable\nsignificance at a later stage.\nOn  January, the day before Asvat\u2019s murder, as press inquiries about the\nactivities of Mandela United began to mount, he was visited in his surgery by a\nnew patient, Jerry Richardson. Richardson said he had been referred by Winnie\nand complained of an abscess. Asvat made a note in red on Richardson\u2019s patient\ncard: \u2018Sent by Winnie\u2019. He found little wrong with Richardson, but told him to\nreturn the next morning for a penicillin injection. Friends and family who met\nAsvat later that day described him as being tense and frightened. Richardson\nduly returned the next morning. In the afternoon, two youths arrived at the\nsurgery, shot Asvat dead and escaped.\nWinnie\u2019s conduct following the murder was strange. Late that night, she\narrived at Asvat\u2019s house, in the company of Richardson and Zindzi, went straight\nup to Asvat\u2019s widow, Zhora, and asked: \u2018Who do you think did this?\u2019 Then she\nsat silently on the floor. The following day she gave a press interview claiming\nthat Asvat had been murdered because he possessed evidence of Verryn\u2019s sexual\nmisconduct, drawing attention for the first time to a possible link between the\nkidnapping at the Methodist manse and Asvat\u2019s murder. The implication was\nthat the Methodist Church was involved in Asvat\u2019s murder. In a subsequent\ntelevision interview, she referred to \u2018a gigantic cover-up by the Church\u2019.\nEven now, with public and press attention gathering pace, the activities of\nMandela United still continued. On  February, as a court subsequently heard, a\nclub member known as Dodo rushed to tell a local community activist, Dudu\nChili, who had been involved in a long-standing feud with Winnie, that Winnie\nhad just finished chairing a meeting at which it had been decided that Chili\u2019s\n\n\fson, Sibusiso, and Lerotodi Ikaneng, whom Richardson had once tried to\nmurder, should be killed. According to Dodo, Winnie had said, \u2018They have\nbecome too problematic.\u2019 On  February, Sibusiso Chili was intercepted by two\nMandela United members, but the alarm was raised and, in the ensuing fracas, it\nwas one of the club members, Maxwell Madondo, who died. In retaliation, club\nmembers attacked Mrs Chili\u2019s house, setting it on fire and shooting dead her\nthirteen year-old niece.\nThe end of Mandela United, however, was nigh. On  February, two forensic\npathologists, alerted by press reports about Stompie\u2019s disappearance, identified\nhis body in the mortuary at Diepkloof. The body, with knife wounds, had been\nfound lying on an open stretch of wasteland on  January by a local woman and\nhad been left unidentified in the mortuary ever since.\nNow that they had a body, the police began to round up suspects, acting on\ninformation from the three kidnap victims, Kgase, Mono and Mekgwe.\nRichardson and other members of the club were arrested. Winnie\u2019s house in\nDiepkloof Extension was raided. In one of the rooms there, police found a\nhandwritten hit-list with eleven names on it, including those of three Chili\nbrothers, Lerotodi Ikaneng and two of Albertina Sisulu\u2019s sons. Police also\narrested two illiterate youths in connection with the murder of Dr Asvat.\nWinnie herself remained curiously immune from police interrogation. She was\nquestioned about the sjamboks found on her premises but denied any knowledge\nof them. She was not required to make a statement in connection with either\nStompie\u2019s death or Asvat\u2019s murder. A statement made by one of the two youths\ncharged with Asvat\u2019s murder clearly implicated her. He claimed that his\naccomplice had said, \u2018Look, I\u2019ve been bought by Winnie Mandela and I must go\nand shoot Dr Asvat dead.\u2019 But the statement was never produced in court. The\nofficial motive for the murder was said to be robbery.\nThe verdict of the black political establishment about Winnie, however, was\nfar more direct. On  February, the day after Stompie\u2019s body had been\nidentified, Murphy Morobe, a prominent political leader, read out a statement\nissued in the name of the Mass Democratic Movement, an umbrella organisation\nrepresenting a huge array of community associations and trade unions, censuring\nher for criminal activity. He began:\nWe have now reached the state where we have no option but to speak publicly\non what is a very sensitive and painful matter. In recent years, Mrs Mandela\u2019s\n\n\factions have increasingly led her into conflict with various sections of the\noppressed people and with the Mass Democratic Movement as a whole. The\nrecent conflict in the community has centred largely around the conduct of her\nso-called football club, which has been widely condemned by the community. In\nparticular, we are outraged by the reign of terror that the team has been\nassociated with. Not only is Mrs Mandela associated with the team, in fact it is\nher creation.\nMorobe then directly linked Winnie to Stompie\u2019s death. \u2018We are outraged at\nMrs Mandela\u2019s obvious complicity in the recent abductions. Had Stompie and\nhis colleagues not been abducted by Mrs Mandela\u2019s \u201cfootball team\u201d, he would\nhave been alive today.\u2019 He went on, \u2018We are not prepared to remain silent where\nthose who are violating human rights claim to be doing so in the name of the\nstruggle against apartheid.\u2019 Winnie had \u2018abused the trust and confidence\u2019 of the\ncommunity. Because of her conduct, he said, \u2018the Mass Democratic Movement\nhereby distances itself from Mrs Mandela and her actions\u2019.\nThe press which had once devoted considerable space to eulogising Winnie\nnow spoke of her as a \u2018fallen idol\u2019. An article by Nomavenda Mathiane reflected\nthe particular anger and contempt felt for her in Soweto. \u2018Headlines like \u201cFallen\nIdol\u201d create the impression that blacks had revered the \u201cMother of the Nation\u201d.\nThe fact is that this title is a mystery, and many black people have never known\nwhere it came from,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018The title was made popular in the eyes of the\noutside world, which shows that if a small group of people set out with a\ndetermination to create a lie they can succeed.\u2019\n\nIn his remote prison cottage at Victor Verster, Mandela was unable to grasp the\nfull extent of the problem. He was well aware of Winnie\u2019s wayward nature, but\nhe believed that she had committed no more than \u2018errors of judgement\u2019 in\nbecoming involved with rough elements in Soweto. He wanted the matter to be\ndealt with internally by the nationalist movement, not through the kind of public\ndenunciation by the Mass Democratic Movement, which was bound to have the\neffect of undermining the anti-apartheid struggle and bolstering the\ngovernment\u2019s credibility.\nOn her visits to Mandela, Winnie always maintained that she had done\nnothing wrong. A passage of conversation recorded by Mandela\u2019s warder, James\nGregory, in his autobiography gives some idea of the course of their discussions.\n\n\fWhen Mandela asked Winnie about a newspaper report that she had whipped the\nkidnap victims with a sjambok, she laughed and said, \u2018Why would I do a thing\nlike that?\u2019\nMandela replied, \u2018That is not an answer to my question.\u2019\n\u2018You of all people should know that you cannot trust what you read in the\nnewspapers. You know how they twist and bend each and every little fact. How\ncan you sit there and look me in the eyes and tell me you believe the newspaper\nand not me? How can you?\u2019\n\u2018Just get rid of these people around you. They are bad for you, this is poor\njudgement to have them near you, to surround yourself with them. You must get\nrid of them.\u2019\n\u2018No, these are people, young boys, who have been rescued from the streets.\nThey need help and I am providing it. I cannot abandon them. They have already\nbeen abandoned once in their lives.\u2019\nThe brief glimpses of Winnie that Mandela had enjoyed during prison visits\nover the years had given him little understanding of the changes in her character\nthat had occurred. In Mandela\u2019s company, Winnie was warm and vivacious, full\nof laughter, dressed to dazzle. He remained deeply in love with her, hoping that\none day, when he was set free, he could resolve all the difficulties that had\naccumulated during his years in prison and pick up the threads of a happy\nmarried existence.\n\n \fCHAPTER \nBOTHA\u2019S TEA PARTY\nAS THE FURORE OVER MANDELA UNITED SUBSIDED, MANDELA\nconcentrated his attention on preparing for the meeting he sought with Botha. To\nclarify the issues, he drew up a ten-page memorandum which he sent in March\n, after Botha had recovered from his stroke. \u2018The deepening political crisis\nin our country has been a matter of grave concern to me for quite some time,\u2019 he\nbegan, \u2018and I now consider it necessary in the national interest for the African\nNational Congress and the government to meet urgently to negotiate an effective\npolitical settlement.\u2019\nHis task, he said, was a limited one\u2014namely, to bring the country\u2019s two major\npolitical bodies to the negotiating table. An early meeting between the\ngovernment and the ANC would constitute the first major step towards lasting\npeace.\nTwo central issues will have to be addressed at such a meeting: firstly,\nthe demand for majority rule in a unitary state; secondly, the concern of\nwhite South Africa over this demand, as well as the insistence of whites\non structural guarantees that majority rule will not mean domination of\nthe white minority by blacks. The most crucial task which will face the\ngovernment and the ANC will be to reconcile these two positions.\nMandela addressed the obstacles that stood in the way of talks, in particular\nthe government\u2019s demands, elaborated by the secret committee, that the ANC\nshould first renounce violence, break its alliance with the Communist Party and\nabandon its demand for majority rule.\nThe position of the ANC on the question of violence is very simple. The\norganization has no vested interest in violence. It abhors any action\nwhich may cause loss of life, destruction of property and misery to the\npeople. It has worked long and patiently for a South Africa of common\nvalues and for an undivided and peaceful nonracial state. But we consider\nthe armed struggle a legitimate form of self-defence against a morally\n\n\frepugnant system of government which will not allow even peaceful\nforms of protest. . .\nIt is perfectly clear on the facts that the refusal of the ANC to renounce\nviolence is not the real problem facing the government. The truth is that\nthe government is not yet ready for negotiation and for the sharing of\npolitical power with blacks. It is still committed to white domination and,\nfor that reason, it will only tolerate those blacks who are willing to serve\non its apartheid structures. Its policy is to remove from the political scene\nblacks who refuse to conform, who reject white supremacy and its\napartheid structures and who insist on equal rights with whites. This is\nthe real reason for the government\u2019s refusal to talk to us, and for its\ndemand that we should disarm ourselves, while it continues to use\nviolence against our people.\nAs he had done countless times with members of the secret committee,\nMandela defended the ANC\u2019s alliance with the Communist Party:\nCooperation between the ANC and the South African Communist Party goes\nback to the early twenties and has always been, and still is, strictly limited to the\nstruggle against racial oppression and for a just society. At no time has the\norganization ever adopted or cooperated with communism itself. Apart from the\nquestion of cooperation between the two organizations, members of the SACP\nhave always been free to join the ANC. But once they do, they become fully\nbound by the policy of the organization set out in the Freedom Charter. As\nmembers of the ANC engaged in the anti-apartheid struggle, their Marxist\nideology is not directly relevant. The SACP has throughout the years accepted\nthe leading role of the ANC, a position which is respected by the SACP\nmembers who join the ANC.\nHe firmly dismissed any suggestion for an end to the alliance:\nNo self-respecting freedom fighter will take orders from the government on how\nto wage the freedom struggle against that same government and on who his\nallies in the freedom struggle should be. . . . No dedicated ANC member will\never heed a call to break with the SACP. We regard such a demand as a purely\ndivisive government strategy.\nIt is in fact a call on us to commit suicide. Which man of honour will ever\ndesert a lifelong friend at the insistence of a common opponent and still retain a\nmeasure of credibility among his people? Which opponent will ever trust such a\n\n\ftreacherous freedom fighter? Yet this is what the government is, in effect, asking\nus to do\u2014to desert our faithful allies. We will not fall into that trap.\nMandela was equally dismissive of the government\u2019s rejection of majority\nrule. The principle of majority rule was a pillar of democracy around the world.\nIt was a principle which was fully accepted in the white politics of South Africa.\nIt was a principle that would have to be accepted in the future if a peaceful\nsettlement was to be reached:\nMajority rule and internal peace are like the two sides of a single coin, and white\nSouth Africa simply has to accept that there will never be peace and stability in\nthis country until the principle is fully applied. It is precisely because of its\ndenial that the government has become the enemy of practically every black\nman. It is that denial that has sparked off the current civil strife.\nMandela concluded by saying that the move he had taken in approaching the\ngovernment provided Botha with an opportunity to overcome the political\ndeadlock in South Africa.\nI hope you will seize it without delay. I believe that the overwhelming\nmajority of South Africans, black and white, hope to see the ANC and\nthe government working closely together to lay the foundations for a new\nera in our country, in which racial discrimination and prejudice, coercion\nand confrontation, death and destruction, will be forgotten.\nWhile waiting for the date of the meeting to be fixed, Mandela invited many\nold friends to visit him at Victor Verster. His memory for detail with regard to\npeople and places from the distant past was astonishing. He was assiduous in\nbringing himself up to date with all that had happened to his visitors, with births\nand marriages and divorces and deaths, remembering the details long into the\nfuture. He made a particular effort to track down his old employer Lazar\nSidelsky, who had helped him forty years before in starting his career as a\nlawyer. They joked about the suit that Sidelsky had given him. Mandela said\nlater that it was one of the most memorable visits in prison he had ever had. A\nsteady stream of political activists also came to Victor Verster and to them\nMandela paid the same courteous attention. Though Winnie was told she could\nremain at Mandela\u2019s cottage whenever she wished, she never stayed overnight,\nclaiming that it would not be appropriate while other ANC people languished in\nprison cells.\nThe meeting with Botha was finally set for  July . Mandela was\n\n\fprovided with a new suit, tie, shirt and shoes. His blood group was checked in\ncase of emergency. He prepared himself by reading every newspaper and\nmagazine he could lay his hands on, reviewed his memorandum and checked his\nnotes. The officials who went with him were anxious that he should make a good\nimpression; one of them retied his tie for him before he set out from Victor\nVerster.\nMandela approached the meeting with some trepidation. Since Botha\u2019s stroke\nin January, his temper was said to be even more ferocious than before. His own\ncolleagues found him increasingly irascible; he refused to listen to advice and\nharboured resentments against them. Mandela resolved that if Botha resorted to\nhis finger-wagging habit, he would interrupt to say he found Botha\u2019s behaviour\nunacceptable and leave.\nArrangements for the meeting were carried out in the utmost secrecy. Mandela\nwas driven to a basement garage beneath Tuynhuys, the Cape Dutch mansion\nalongside parliament in the centre of Cape Town which served as the president\u2019s\nofficial residence. Accompanied by prison officials, he took a lift to the ground\nfloor and stepped out into a wood-panelled lobby in front of the president\u2019s\noffice, where he met Coetsee and Barnard. Both were worried that Botha\u2019s\ntemper might erupt during the encounter. Barnard noticed that Mandela\u2019s\nshoelaces were not properly tied and quickly knelt down to retie them. \u2018I realized\njust how nervous they were,\u2019 said Mandela, \u2018and that did not make me any\ncalmer.\u2019\nAs Mandela entered the president\u2019s office, Botha walked towards him from\nthe opposite side of the room, his hand outstretched, smiling broadly. Instead of\nthe grim, cantankerous figure he had expected to meet, Mandela found Botha \u2018a\ncharming man indeed\u2019, unfailingly courteous and friendly: \u2018The thing that\nimpressed was that he poured the tea.\u2019\nTheir conversation amounted to little more than a polite discourse on South\nAfrican history and culture. Mandela mentioned that he had recently read an\narticle in an Afrikaans magazine about the  Afrikaner rebellion and drew\nparallels between their rival nationalisms. The African nationalist struggle, he\nsaid, was not unlike the  Afrikaner rebellion: the one pitted Afrikaner\nbrother against brother; the other was a struggle \u2018between brothers who\nhappened to be different colours\u2019. No policy matters were discussed and no\nnegotiations took place. Towards the end of the half-hour meeting, Mandela\n\n\fasked for the unconditional release of all political prisoners. Botha replied that\nhe was afraid he could not do that. They parted amicably, Botha saying what a\npleasure the meeting had been and Mandela concurring.\nWhen news of the meeting leaked out a few days later, the meeting was\ndescribed, fairly accurately, as \u2018a courtesy call\u2019. The symbolic importance of\nBotha sitting down with a prisoner whom he had hitherto denounced as a\n\u2018communist terrorist\u2019 was real enough. But Botha was still no nearer to\naddressing the central issue of political reform that Mandela had raised in his\nmemorandum. It was a matter he never seriously contemplated.\nSix weeks later, on  August, after months of friction with his cabinet\ncolleagues, Botha announced his resignation as president in a long, rambling\ntelevision address. The man who succeeded him, Frederik Willem de Klerk, was\nchosen because of his solid conservative credentials.\n \fCHAPTER \n\nA STEP TO FREEDOM\nDE KLERK HAD BEEN A DEDICATED DISCIPLE OF THE APARTHEID\nsystem throughout his political career. He came from a prominent Afrikaner\nfamily at the heart of the political establishment which had ruled South Africa\nsince . His father, Jan, had served as a cabinet minister under three prime\nministers, including Verwoerd. His uncle by marriage, Hans Strijdom, was a\nformer prime minister outspoken in his support of white supremacy. His\ngrandfather, a friend of Paul Kruger, leader of the old Transvaal republic, had\nalso made his mark as an activist in the Afrikaner cause. The household in which\nthe young de Klerk grew up, therefore, was steeped in the traditions of Afrikaner\npolitics and history.\nHis own rise within the National Party was rapid. After establishing a\nsuccessful law practice in the Transvaal town of Vereeniging, he entered\nparliament in  and in , at the age of forty-two, became the youngest\nmember of John Vorster\u2019s cabinet. What was notable about his political record,\nin seventeen years as a member of parliament and cabinet minister, was his rigid\nloyalty to the National Party and all that it stood for. He conformed faithfully to\nevery party policy of the time. Over the years, he had spoken out adamantly\nagainst integrated sport, mixed marriages, trade union rights for blacks and black\ndemands for permanent residence in white South Africa. Above all, he was a\nforceful proponent of the National Party\u2019s commitment to \u2018group rights\u2019\u2014\nkeeping apart, wherever possible, South Africa\u2019s four main racial groups. In\nBotha\u2019s government, he was given control of the white \u2018own affairs\u2019 portfolio\nand distinguished himself as a zealous advocate of white interests. Whites, he\nsaid in , must be guaranteed a \u2018community life, their own living areas,\nschools, institutions and systems\u2019. Each group should have its own power base,\nhe said, and make its own decisions about community issues.\nIn cabinet, de Klerk was noted for constantly throwing up obstacles to reform.\nAs minister of education, he fought to keep blacks out of white universities. He\nalso sponsored a bill that would have enabled him to use financial pressure to\n\n\fforce universities to crack down on anti-apartheid agitators on campus\u2014a\nmeasure that the Supreme Court subsequently ruled to be invalid. At a public\nmeeting in , he urged whites to report people of other racial groups living in\nsegregated white areas, even though the authorities by then tended to ignore\ninformal integration. When the verligte foreign minister, Pik Botha, suggested in\n that South Africa might one day have a black president, it was de Klerk,\nrather than P. W. Botha, who insisted that he should publicly retract his\nstatement. In his eleven years in cabinet, there was not a single piece of reform\nwith which de Klerk had been associated.\nWhen the time came to choose a new head of the National Party after Botha\u2019s\nsudden and unexpected resignation from the post in February , de Klerk\nwas the favoured candidate of the verkrampte camp, which wanted to stand fast\nagainst further reform and believed that he was the man to do it. The verligte\ncamp, meanwhile, put forward three candidates, split the vote and enabled de\nKlerk to be elected. As head of the National Party, he was in line to succeed\nBotha as president.\nExamining his record, the press considered it unlikely that de Klerk would get\nto grips with the fundamental issues facing South Africa any more than Botha\nhad. De Klerk had never shown any particular flair or talent. He was amiable,\nshrewd and polished but without charisma or vision. Above all else, he was a\nparty man. His main difference from Botha was that he appeared to be more\nopen and communicative. It was noted that his wife, Marike, was an archconservative. In a speech she gave at an old-age home, she had referred\ncontemptuously to Coloureds as \u2018a negative group of \u2018non-persons\u2019 who were\nSouth Africa\u2019s historic \u2018leftovers\u2019.\nHis older brother, a prominent verligte and newspaper editor, had no great\nexpectations of him. \u2018He is too strongly convinced that racial grouping is the\nonly truth, way and life,\u2019 Willem de Klerk wrote in a magazine article published\nin March . \u2018He is too dismissive of a more radical style.\u2019 He predicted that\nhis brother would follow a cautious, centrist path, holding \u2018the middle ground by\nmeans of clever footwork, small compromises, drawn-out studies and planned\nprocesses, effective diplomacy and growing authority through balanced\nleadership and control\u2019. That, Willem wrote, \u2018is his style, his nature, his talent\nand his conviction\u2019. So, there would be no leap of faith in a liberal direction.\nFrom the vantage point of the president\u2019s office, however, de Klerk began a\n\n\freassessment of South Africa\u2019s prospects. Forty years of National Party rule had\nleft the white population powerful and prosperous; the Afrikaner community, in\nparticular, had fared well, fulfilling their long-held ambition of acquiring wealth,\nskills and economic strength. The government\u2019s ability to defend the apartheid\nsystem was still formidable. Its powers of repression had hardly been tested. Its\nsecurity forces were more than a match for any threat from either township\nactivists or trained guerrillas. It possessed enough allies within the black\ncommunity\u2014homeland leaders, urban politicians, vigilante groups\u2014to make the\nsystem work. At a regional level, its hegemony over southern Africa remained\nunchallenged. At an international level, despite the world-wide opprobrium that\nSouth Africa aroused, it faced no serious threat; sanctions were a costly rather\nthan a damaging imposition.\nWhat struck de Klerk, in assessing the government\u2019s options, was the lack of\nany viable political strategy. The whole emphasis of Botha\u2019s policy in recent\nyears had been security management. South Africa was, in effect, being ruled by\nsecurity managers with enormous powers at their disposal. All Botha\u2019s efforts to\nlure \u2018moderate\u2019 African leaders into a dialogue with the government, offering\nthem a \u2018national forum\u2019 in which to make their views known, had come to\nnaught. Not a single reputable African politician had stepped forward to support\nit. Even conservative leaders like KwaZulu\u2019s Chief Buthelezi demanded far\nmore from Botha, including the release of Mandela and the lifting of the ban on\nthe ANC, before they were willing to enter negotiations.\nDe Klerk had long been mindful of the need to find a political accommodation\nwith the black population. While acting zealously to protect white interests, he\nacknowledged that blacks too had an equal right to run their own institutions.\n\u2018We must provide for urban blacks own political institutions, own political\npower bases, own legislatures, own executives, so that they can get the same\ndegree of self-determination as the \u201chomeland\u201d blacks, as the whites have within\nthe House of Assembly and as the Coloureds have in their own Chamber,\u2019 he\nsaid in . \u2018When that is attained, every South African will elect leaders with\nimportant and visible powers.\u2019\nThe advice he received in  from several quarters, from senior figures in\nthe Broederbond, from the National Intelligence Service, from verligte\npoliticians in the cabinet and from other prominent Afrikaner intellectuals and\njournalists, was that the modernised form of apartheid he envisaged would no\nlonger work. If the whites were to preserve the power and privileges they had\n\n\fenjoyed for so long, a more fundamental change was needed. While the\ngovernment faced no immediate difficulty, the longer political reform was\ndelayed, the weaker its position would become. Without reform, the cycle of\nblack opposition would become increasingly widespread and violent. The fate of\nneighbouring Rhodesia, where the white-minority leader, Ian Smith, had turned\ndown one favourable deal after another, only to find himself embroiled in a\nseven-year long guerrilla war and negotiating a belated settlement which led to\nthe advent of a Marxist government, provided a potent example. \u2018When the\nopportunity was there for real constructive negotiations, it was not grasped,\u2019\nconcluded de Klerk. \u2018We must not make that mistake.\u2019 A phrase that Pieter de\nLange, the Broederbond chairman, used in a memorandum advocating reform\nbecame embedded in de Klerk\u2019s thinking: \u2018The greatest risk is not to take any\nrisk.\u2019 De Klerk later remarked, \u2018We had to escape from a corner where\neverything stagnated into confrontation.\u2019\nDe Klerk\u2019s dilemma, however, once he had accepted the argument that a new\npolitical dispensation was necessary, was that there was no way of embarking on\nnegotiations for one without the inclusion of the ANC. No credible African\nleader would participate until Mandela had been released and the ban on the\nANC was lifted. But the risks for de Klerk in doing so were considerable. The\ngovernment had devoted years of propaganda to telling South Africa\u2019s whites\nthat the ANC was a bunch of communist terrorists. It had repeatedly committed\nitself not to negotiate with any leader or organisation engaged in violence. By\nabandoning this position, it would be conceding a significant victory to the\nANC. The result might be further violence as black radicals took to the streets to\npush the revolution forwards. Moreover, any concession to the ANC was bound\nto undermine his support within the white community and boost the threat from\nhis right-wing opponents which he constantly feared.\nOn the other hand, the timing for a new initiative seemed propitious. The\ncollapse of socialist governments in Eastern Europe in  not only deprived\nthe ANC of one of its main sources of financial, logistical and military support\nbut also undermined its sense of ideological direction. The Soviet Union,\nmeanwhile, had made clear its intention of disentangling itself from regional\nconflicts. A deal in  over the independence of neighbouring Namibia, which\nSouth Africa controlled, required the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola,\nonce seen as part of the communist threat to South Africa. In a matter of months,\nthe spectre of \u2018total onslaught\u2019 which had dominated government thinking\n\n\fduring the Botha era, receded. The fear that the ANC could be used as \u2018a Trojan\nhorse\u2019 by the Soviet Union fell away. De Klerk\u2019s principal strategist, Gerrit\nViljoen, a former head of the Broederbond, recalled, \u2018We recognised it as a\nunique opportunity in the course of history, a God-given opportunity\u2014we\nthought of it very much in Christian terms\u2014to ensure that conflict in South\nAfrica could be resolved.\u2019\nDe Klerk quickly grasped the importance of these strategic openings. He was\nnot a man driven by any sense of moral imperative about the need to bring\napartheid to an end. The church to which he belonged, the Gereformeerde Kerk,\nthe strictest of the Dutch Reformed Churches, had spent decades justifying the\napartheid system on biblical and moral grounds. De Klerk himself believed\nfirmly that apartheid had been an \u2018honourable\u2019 attempt to assist the separate\ndevelopment of black tribal groups as well as whites. It was only \u2018wrong\u2019, he\nonce said, because it had become \u2018unworkable\u2019. He also carried with him none\nof the ideological baggage which had so influenced previous National Party\nleaders. He was essentially a pragmatist, determined above all else to protect\nAfrikaner interests. Group rights remained his lodestar and he was confident of\nsecuring them in any new political dispensation.\nDe Klerk found that considerable preparatory work had already been\nundertaken. Mandela\u2019s persistent efforts since  to establish a dialogue with\nthe government had done much to foster a climate conducive to negotiations.\nBoth Kobie Coetsee and Niel Barnard were convinced that Mandela was a man\nwith whom the government could do business. By inviting Mandela to tea at\nTuynhuys, whatever his motives, Botha had already accorded him a measure of\nrespectability that belied years of government propaganda.\nOther reports that de Klerk received were also promising. A group of\nprominent Afrikaners regularly meeting ANC officials in secret in England were\nimpressed by the ANC\u2019s willingness to enter realistic discussions. Among the\ngroup was Willem de Klerk, who, after each meeting he attended, wrote a frank\nassessment of ANC intentions which he passed on to his brother. He spoke of\nthe meetings as \u2018a bridge-building exercise\u2019 notable for producing a degree of\nunderstanding between the two asides.\nIn August , the ANC set out publicly for the first time its proposals on\nhow to proceed towards a negotiated settlement. \u2018A conjuncture of\ncircumstances exists which, if there is a demonstrable readiness on the part of\n\n\fthe Pretoria regime to engage in negotiations genuinely and seriously, could\ncreate the possibility to end apartheid through negotiation, \u2019 said the ANC\u2019s\nHarare Declaration. It listed five preconditions for negotiation: lifting the state of\nemergency; ending restrictions on political activity; legalising all political\norganisations; releasing all political prisoners; and stopping all armed violence,\nenabling constitutional negotiations to proceed.\nOn his journeys abroad, de Klerk was readily assured by Western\ngovernments of support if he changed course. From one capital to the next, the\nadvice he was given was the same: lift the ban on the ANC, release political\nprisoners and start talks. He was left in no doubt that any initiative he took which\nexcluded the ANC would be dismissed by Western governments as worthless.\nThe mood of much of the white population favoured change. A new\ngeneration of white South Africans disliked being treated as pariahs by the rest\nof the world, subjected to sports boycotts, travel bans, trade sanctions and hostile\ncomments. Businessmen were adamant about the need for a more stable political\nsystem that would encourage economic growth and rid South Africa of the cost\nof sanctions. Economic prosperity was becoming more important to white South\nAfrica than racial division.\nA general election in September  provided some clue as to where the\nwhite population stood. De Klerk, fearing the threat from extreme right-wing\nparties vehemently opposed to reform, campaigned on a right-wing platform,\ndenouncing as traitors white liberal opponents who had been in contact with the\nANC and standing firm in defence of group rights. He made no mention of any\npolitical initiative. The result gave the National Party a thin margin of victory.\nOnly  per cent of . million whites voted for the National Party, the first time\nin thirty years it had received less than an absolute majority. The extreme rightwing Conservative Party gained about  per cent of the vote. The liberal\nDemocratic Party took  per cent. In the months ahead, de Klerk was to argue\nthat two-thirds of the white electorate\u2014the National Party vote plus the\nDemocratic Party vote\u2014had given him a mandate for reform.\nThe first sign of change came one week after the election when de Klerk,\nagainst the advice of his own security managers, gave permission for a\ndemonstration against police brutality to proceed through the streets of Cape\nTown, an event that during the Botha era would have resulted in outright\nrepression. The shock for many whites of seeing on the television news the\n\n\fspectacle of tens of thousands of anti-apartheid demonstrators swarming through\nCape Town was considerable. De Klerk reasoned that if he did not permit\norderly demonstrations, then he would soon face disorderly ones.\nHis next step signalled far more radical change ahead. In October, Walter\nSisulu, Ahmed Kathrada and four other ANC life prisoners were set free after\ntwenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment. Sisulu was dropped off at his small, redbricked house in Soweto in a police van. His homecoming, at the age of seventyseven, was marked by one of the greatest celebrations that Soweto had ever\nexperienced. At home to welcome him was his beloved Albertina, whose own\nordeal during his years in prison had matched that of Winnie Mandela. As well\nas her own spells of imprisonment, solitary confinement and house arrest, one of\nAlbertina\u2019s sons had been banned and detained, another had served a prison\nsentence for resistance activity and yet another son and daughter had gone into\nexile. Yet through it all, Albertina had been a rock of stability. The Sisulus\nsettled down to a \u2018second\u2019 marriage better, they said, than the first: this time\nthere were no restrictions, no banning orders, no police raids, no prison.\nMandela was the last of the Rivonia group to remain in prison. Mbeki had left\nin  and now the others had gone. Mandela had negotiated their release\nduring the secret sessions of Coetsee\u2019s committee and he expected his own to\nfollow soon. His discussions with the committee, meanwhile, continued to range\nwidely over political issues, taking on greater significance with the addition of\nGerrit Viljoen, de Klerk\u2019s principal strategist, to the team.\nOn  December, Mandela was taken to the president\u2019s office in Cape Town,\nto the same room where he had sipped tea with Botha. The encounter was\namicable and businesslike. \u2018He met me on the basis of equality and discussed\nissues objectively,\u2019 Mandela recalled. Mandela was impressed by de Klerk\u2019s\nwillingness to listen. Mandela made clear his opposition to the idea of \u2018group\nrights\u2019, which he saw as a means of perpetuating white domination. De Klerk\nreplied that group rights were intended to deal with the problem of white fears of\nblack domination, an issue which Mandela himself acknowledged needed to be\naddressed. Mandela\u2019s response was that the idea of group rights did more to\nincrease black suspicions than to allay white fears, at which de Klerk rejoined,\n\u2018We will have to change it, then.\u2019\nMandela raised the question of his own release. There was no point in his\nleaving prison unless the ban on the ANC was also lifted, since he would then be\n\n\fworking for an illegal organisation and face arrest once more. The best way\nforward, he said, was to unban all illegal organisations, release all political\nprisoners and lift the state of emergency, as the ANC had demanded. De Klerk\nlistened carefully. By the end of the meeting, Mandela had concluded that de\nKlerk was a man with whom he could do business.\nDe Klerk had yet to decide how far to take his reforms. The issues were\nthrashed out at a special bush conference, or bosberaad, in northwestern\nTransvaal in December, attended by the entire cabinet and some fifty officials\nand advisers. There was heated debate about the lifting of the ban on political\norganisations, in particular the Communist Party. The defence minister, Magnus\nMalan, a leading figure in the \u2018total onslaught\u2019 school, argued vehemently\nagainst unbanning the Communist Party. Others pointed out that if any\nopposition group remained unbanned, its allies would launch vociferous\ncampaigns in its support, undermining the credit the government would\notherwise gain.\nDe Klerk believed that there would be considerable advantage in seizing the\ninitiative and capturing the \u2018moral high ground\u2019. The government was acting\nfrom a position of strength and would continue to do so. Its ability to remain\nfirmly in control was not in doubt. The chances were that the ANC, poorly\norganised and ill-prepared for peace, would fall into disarray, leaving the\ngovernment to forge ahead in a new alliance with conservative black leaders like\nButhelezi and moderate black organisations.\nOnly a handful of trusted advisers were privy in advance to the decisions de\nKlerk announced in parliament in Cape Town on  February . He did not\ninform the National Party\u2019s parliamentary caucus. He did not even tell his wife.\nNo one expected such sweeping measures.\nIn a calm, confident manner, de Klerk announced that he was lifting the ban\non the whole spectrum of liberation organisations: the African National\nCongress, Umkhonto we Sizwe, the South African Communist Party and the\nPan-Africanist Congress. He further announced that emergency regulations\nwould be eased; media restrictions would be abolished; political prisoners would\nbe released; exiles would be allowed to return home; capital punishment would\nbe suspended; and apartheid laws like the Separate Amenities Act would be\nrepealed. \u2018It is time for us to break out of the cycle of violence and break\nthrough to peace and reconciliation,\u2019 he declared, outlining new aims towards\n\n\fwhich the government would work. These included a new democratic\nconstitution, universal franchise and the protection of minorities as well as of\nindividual rights. He asked black leaders to join him. \u2018Walk through the door\nand take your place at the negotiating table together with the government,\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018The time for negotiations has come.\u2019\nDe Klerk left his announcement about Mandela\u2019s release for his grande finale.\nMandela, he said, \u2018could play an important part\u2019 in negotiations for a peaceful\nsettlement. He would be released \u2018unconditionally\u2019 and \u2018without delay\u2019.\nThe boldness of de Klerk\u2019s reforms set South Africa on an entirely new\ncourse. In effect, he had pronounced the death sentence of apartheid. The central\nissue had always been political power. None of the reforms hitherto\nimplemented by National Party leaders had come close to addressing that issue.\nNow, in a stroke, de Klerk had conceded one-person one-vote and opened the\nway for its attainment. But the route there was to be marked by greater turmoil\nthan anything South Africa had previously experienced.\n\nThe arrangement for Mandela\u2019s release were soon enmeshed in argument. On \nFebruary, seven days after de Klerk\u2019s announcement, Mandela was taken to\nTuynhuys, where de Klerk informed him that he would be released in\nJohannesburg the following day. Mandela was intensely annoyed at de Klerk\u2019s\ndecision to free him without consultation and without warning. He told de Klerk\nthat he needed a week\u2019s notice so that proper preparations could be made both\nby his family and by party officials; otherwise the results would be chaos. He\nwanted to be able to walk out of the gates of Victor Verster to visit nearby Paarl\nto thank the people there for their kindness during his stay there, and then to\naddress a public meeting in Cape Town. Cape Town had been his home for\nnearly three decades. He would make his own way back to Johannesburg in his\nown time, he said.\nNegotiations over the exact time and place of his release continued for five\nhours. Mandela remembered the experience as \u2018a conflict between my blood and\nmy brains\u2019, wanting to leave prison as soon as possible but recognising the risks\nin doing so. The difficulty for de Klerk was that the government had already told\nthe foreign press of Mandela\u2019s imminent release and could not afford delay. The\ncompromise eventually reached was that Mandela would be released from Victor\nVerster prison at precisely  p.m. on Sunday  February. De Klerk poured\n\n\fglasses of whisky to mark the occasion. Mandela, disliking strong spirits,\npretended to drink. He left the meeting in a thoroughly bad mood.\nOn the morning of  February, Mandela rose at dawn and went through a\nshortened version of his exercise routine. The prison doctor called by to give him\na brief examination. Mandela joked, \u2018It\u2019s a bit late to find something wrong.\u2019\nMembers of his reception committee arrived to discuss the day\u2019s schedule. They\ndismissed Mandela\u2019s idea of making his first speech to the citizens of Paarl.\nThey wanted him instead to drive, as planned, straight to the Grand Parade in\nCape Town to address a mass rally of supporters from the balcony of City Hall.\nA crowd of thousands had been gathering there since the early morning. The\ndetails of Mandela\u2019s speech had been worked over for hours. Many ANC\nofficials were worried by the rumours circulating about his secret talks with\ngovernment officials which had created the suspicion that he had done a deal\nwith them. They felt it important that Mandela should make clear his loyalty to\nthe ANC and to the party line.\nThe house was soon full of dozens of people. Amid all the excitement and\nactivity, Mandela took time to say warm farewells to the prison staff who had\nbecome his friends. To Warrant Officer Gregory, who had known him for\ntwenty-three years, he wrote a short note: \u2018The wonderful hours we spent\ntogether during the last two decades end today. But you will always be in my\nthoughts.\u2019 The two men shook hands and embraced. \u2018We will see each other\nagain,\u2019 said Mandela.\nThe schedule for his release soon began to go awry. Winnie\u2019s party, flying in\nfrom Johannesburg, arrived late. The final meal was delayed. It was  p.m.\nbefore the cavalcade of cars taking him to Cape Town was ready to leave. As\nMandela was driven through the prison grounds, the families of prison guards,\nall of them white, stood in their gardens and waved goodbye.\nWithin sight of the prison gates, Mandela alighted and, with a slightly fragile\nair, walked the last few yards, hand-in-hand with Winnie, towards a waiting\ncrowd of supporters and the ranks of the world\u2019s media.\nThe size of the crowd, plus the hundreds of photographers, television crews\nand reporters gathered to witness the occasion, astounded him. He had expected\nno more than a few dozen people. \u2018Only when I saw the crowd did I realize that I\nhad not thought carefully enough about the events of the day,\u2019 he said later. As\neveryone pressed to get nearer, Mandela and Winnie were hustled back into their\n\n\fcar and driven away through the throng.\nOn his way to Cape Town, passing through the vineyards and orchards of\nsome of the richest Afrikaner farms in the country, Mandela remarked on the\nnumber of whites he saw standing by the side of the road to catch a glimpse of\nhim. Some even saluted as he drove by. He was to mention it again and again\nover the next few days. The numbers were, in fact, relatively small, but that they\nwere there at all impressed him. At one point, he stopped the car to thank a white\nfamily for their support.\nThe mood of the crowds awaiting Mandela in Grand Parade had meanwhile\nbecome increasingly restless. By mid-afternoon, some , people had\nassembled in front of the City Hall, where a huge banner had been draped over\nthe upper balcony saying \u2018Nelson Mandela, the nation welcomes you home\u2019. On\nthe edge of the square, groups of youths began breaking into shops and looting\nthem. The police retaliated with shotguns and pistols. An emergency aid post\nwas soon filled with scores of wounded victims. When ANC officials appealed\nfor calm and discipline, they were rewarded with jeers, whistles and slow\nhandclaps. Skirmishes between youths and police continued for hours while the\ncrowd waited for Mandela\u2019s arrival. Much of the blame for the disorder on\nGrand Parade that day was attributed to the ANC\u2019s poor organisation.\nWhen Mandela\u2019s car eventually reached Grand Parade, the driver, instead of\ntaking him to the rear of the City Hall as planned, tried to find a way through the\ncrowd at the front. The car was soon engulfed by a sea of people pressing close,\nhammering on the windows, the bonnet, the boot. For more than an hour,\nMandela was trapped by his own supporters while ANC officials struggled to\nsecure an exit route for the car. Once freed, the driver, instead of heading for the\nrear entrance, sped away from City Hall just to avoid the crowds. To calm him\ndown, Mandela gave him directions to the house of his attorney, Dullah Omar.\nHe had been there for only a few minutes when an agitated telephone call came\nthrough from Archbishop Desmond Tutu at the City Hall telling him that unless\nhe arrived soon there might be serious disturbances.\nBy the time Mandela finally reached City Hall, it was almost dark. Most of the\ncrowd had dispersed and the , or so who remained found it difficult to see\nhim. Mandela also discovered at the last moment, as he reached for his speech,\nthat he had left his reading spectacles behind at Victor Verster. Fortunately, he\nwas able to use a pair belonging to Winnie, but they were ill-fitting and kept\n\n\fslipping from his nose.\nThe speech that Mandela made that evening, the first public speech he had\nmade since the Rivonia trial, was broadcast around the world. It was a crude,\npartisan speech, reflecting the narrow, parochial interests of ANC officials who\nhad had a hand in drafting it at Victor Verster. There was no sense of vision or\nwider purpose, no call for national reconciliation. It consisted mainly of\nmessages that party officials wanted to transmit to their own constituency.\nMandela went to great lengths to allay suspicions that he had done a secret\ndeal with the government. He was, he said, \u2018a loyal and disciplined\u2019 member of\nthe ANC. \u2018My talks with the government have been aimed at normalising the\npolitical situation in the country,\u2019 he said. \u2018I wish to stress that I myself have at\nno time entered into negotiations about the future of the country, except to insist\non a meeting between the ANC and the government . . . Negotiations cannot take\nplace above the heads or behind the backs of our people.\u2019\nThe armed struggle would continue, he said, until the conditions were right for\nnegotiations to start. The government had yet to fulfil the ANC\u2019s demands for\nlifting the state of emergency and releasing political prisoners. This was not the\ntime for the ANC to relax its efforts: \u2018Now is the time to intensify the struggle\non all fronts.\u2019\nHe paid tribute to a long list of organisations for their contribution to the\nstruggle and made the point of singling out for special praise his old friend Joe\nSlovo, the Communist Party\u2019s general secretary\u2014\u2018one of our finest patriots\u2019.\nMixed in with the party rhetoric were a few conciliatory remarks: \u2018We express\nthe hope that a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement would be created\nsoon so that there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle.\u2019 De Klerk,\nhe said, had gone further than any other National Party leader in taking \u2018real\nsteps to normalise the situation\u2019. In words that would come to haunt him, he\ndescribed de Klerk as \u2018a man of integrity\u2019. But the overall tone was\nuncompromising.\nIt was a speech which raised doubts about the quality of Mandela\u2019s leadership.\nWas he a man who would inspire his people to make peace and achieve national\nreconciliation or would he stir up anew black militancy against whites? To\nwhites, his speech seemed needlessly militant. To many blacks, it seemed\nambiguous, calling them to arms at one moment and suggesting negotiations the\nnext.\n\n\fMandela spent his first night of freedom at Bishopscourt, the elegant residence\nof the Anglican archbishop, Desmond Tutu, in an affluent suburb on the slopes\nof Devil\u2019s Peak. Tutu himself had long been a prominent anti-apartheid activist,\nreceiving the Nobel Peace Prize in .\nThe next morning, in the garden at Bishopscourt, Mandela faced the world\u2019s\nmedia, presenting a very different image from the night before. He exuded an\ninner calm and confidence, displaying a spirit of generosity entirely missing\nfrom his Grand Parade address. His charm of manner captivated journalists. He\nanswered questions with an agility and ease that they found all the more\nremarkable because of his years of isolation from the modern world. He\ngraciously paid tribute to the press for remembering him and his colleagues\nduring their long ordeal, and when he recognised the names of questioners\nfamiliar to him from his endless reading of newspapers, he greeted them in\npersonal terms. Most remarkable of all was the absence of any trace of bitterness\nabout his long years of imprisonment.\nHis message now was full of hope and conciliation. He recognised, he said,\nthat whites were concerned about the demand for one-person one-vote and\nwanted structural guarantees to ensure that they were not dominated by blacks:\n\u2018We understand that fear. The whites are fellow South Africans. We want them\nto feel safe.\u2019 He appealed to them to help build a new South Africa: \u2018We\nappreciate the contribution they made towards the development of this country.\u2019\nHe referred again to de Klerk as \u2018a man of integrity\u2019. In his discussions with\nhim, de Klerk had proved to be very flexible:\nAs an organisation, of course, we are concerned not so much with the personal\nvirtues of an individual. Our policy and strategies are determined by the harsh\nreality of the fact that the National Party has a policy which is not progressive.\nAnd that is what determines our attitude. But I am confident that, if Mr de Klerk\nis able to carry the National Party with him in the new line he has taken, he\nhimself wants to normalise the situation as soon as possible. Therefore I think\nthat very soon obstacles to negotiation will be removed and it will be possible\nfor us to sit down and talk.\nIt was a masterly performance. At the end of the conference, the journalists\npresent, some  in all, broke all professional rules and burst into applause,\nsomething most of them had never done before. The press that morning had been\nhighly critical of the previous day\u2019s mayhem on Grand Parade and of the tenor\n\n\fof his speech from the balcony. In a matter of fifty minutes, Mandela had won\nthem over.\nFrom Cape Town, Mandela and Winnie then flew to Johannesburg. Mandela\nwas determined to live in their house in Orlando West, no. , which held so\nmany memories for him, even though it was now too small for his needs. Since\nthe fire in , it had been solidly rebuilt, but it still consisted of only four\nrooms. He rejected suggestions that he should move to Winnie\u2019s mansion in\nBeverly Hills, considering it both too ostentatious and too remote from the\ncommunity. But on arriving in Johannesburg, he was told that the house in\nOrlando was surrounded by a throng of supporters, so he was obliged to stay at a\nfriend\u2019s in the northern suburbs.\nThe following day, he was given a tumultuous welcome at a football stadium\nin Soweto packed to capacity and surrounded by even greater crowds outside. It\nwas only then, after the rally had ended, that Mandela finally returned home,\nafter twenty-seven years.\n\nMandela was asked once how different was the man who emerged from prison\nafter twenty-seven years from the one who went in. He replied, with\ncharacteristic brevity, \u2018I came out mature.\u2019 Mandela disliked talking about\nhimself and allowed few glimpses of his personal thoughts or emotions. The\nyears of his imprisonment had turned him into a intensely private person. Even\nwith his closest friends, his true feelings remained hidden. He was anxious never\nto betray the slightest sign of weakness either to them or to prison staff,\ndetermined to stifle the anger that lay within. Self-control became an abiding\nhabit. On his release, he was articulate and fluent in discussing political matters,\nbut uneasy and reticent when asked to describe his emotions as he came out of\nprison. \u2018I must confess that I am unable to describe my emotions,\u2019 he replied. \u2018I\nwas completely overwhelmed by the enthusiasm. It is something I did not\nexpect. I would be merely rationalising if I told you that I am able to describe\nmy own feelings. It was breathtaking, that\u2019s all I can say.\u2019 His close friend\nAmina Cachalia, who had known him for forty years, observed,\u2019 He had to learn\nhow to communicate again.\u2019\nHe preferred to discuss his role as a member of a team of colleagues than his\nposition as an individual. \u2018I find it difficult to personalise the collective\nexperience of prison.\u2019 The comradeship of his fellow prisoners, their strength in\n\n\fadversity, was one of his favourite themes.\nBut there were other themes that were unexpected. Mandela did not regard his\nyears in prison as wasted. \u2018One of the advantages was the ability to sit down and\nto think,\u2019 he said. \u2018We had the opportunity of reflecting on past mistakes and\nplanning how we would handle problems when we were released from prison. It\nwas a rewarding experience.\u2019\nNot once did Mandela express bitterness towards the white community for his\nordeal, only against the system they imposed. The cause of non-racial\ndemocracy, he knew, could only be impeded by hatred and resentment of the\nwhite community. It was the knowledge that the cause for which he had been\nimprisoned was morally right that had done so much to fortify him there. \u2018It was\nnot so much the inner strength of any individual that enabled us to go through\nsome of the harshest experiences you can imagine, but that we stood for a good\ncause.\u2019 That cause would only be undermined by any expression of racial\nanimosity.\nHe often felt anger about whites, he said, but not hatred. His hatred was\ndirected at the system. His anger was directed at individuals, never against\nwhites as a group. \u2018I have felt anger, especially at the police, who have subjected\nmy wife and family to harassment while I was in prison. But anger is a\ntemporary feeling. You soon forget it, particularly if you are involved in positive\nactivities and attitudes.\u2019\nThough warders in prison were part of a repressive system, he judged them\nindividually and formed friendships with some. \u2018We had many friends among\nwarders who tried as much as possible to make our conditions as comfortable as\npossible.\u2019 He cited the example of James Gregory: \u2018Even though Gregory was a\nwarder and had to carry out unpopular and even repressive policies, as an\nindividual he was a gentleman and we became great friends.\u2019 It was the attitude\nof such men that \u2018wiped out any bitterness which a man could have\u2019 about losing\ntwenty-seven years of his life.\nWhile the outside world had expected Mandela to dwell on the suffering he\nand his colleagues had endured in prison, he himself was more interested in\nexplaining what they had learned there, the understanding they had gained, the\nreasons for their lack of bitterness, the strength of their commitment to\ndemocracy which had sustained them. The example he set was of profound\nimportance. For, if after twenty-seven years in prison, Mandela could emerge\n\n\finsisting on reconciliation, it undermined the demands of those seeking revenge\nand retribution.\nOnly on one issue, the persecution of Winnie and their two daughters, was\nMandela forthcoming about his own personal feelings. He spoke of the pain and\nguilt he felt at knowing that his family was exposed to harassment and insecurity\nwithout him there to protect them: \u2018It is not a nice feeling for a man to see his\nfamily struggling, without security, without the dignity of the head of the\nfamily.\u2019 Their suffering, he said, was greater than his own. Mandela made it\nclear that he felt he owed Winnie a huge debt for what she had endured on his\nbehalf. It was a debt, he said, that he intended to pay off now that he was free. In\nthe coming months Winnie was to exploit to the full his sense of guilt for her\nown benefit.\nOld friends remarked on how much his appearance and his manner had\nchanged. Hilda Bernstein, whose family used to know him as \u2018the giant\u2019, noted,\nafter her first meeting with him:\nNelson has changed a lot. He is still so upright, bearing himself with dignity, but\nhe is thin, his face, once round and full-cheeked, has narrowed; his eyes, the\nvoice, the smile are the same, but the prison years have robbed him of his air of\nfun and gaiety. He is sober, immensely dignified, conscious of the expectations\narising from the role into which he has been cast.\nReporters watching him descend the stone steps in the gardens at\nBishopscourt observed how he walked with the stiff gait of an elderly\ngentleman. Despite his aristocratic bearing, he seemed at times almost frail.\nThere was much speculation about the state of his health, about whether, at the\nage of seventy-one, he would stand up to the stresses and strains of leadership in\nthe days that lay ahead. The years in prison had taken their toll. He had suffered\nfrom high blood pressure, from tuberculosis and from back pains. He was also\nafflicted by an eye ailment acquired as a result of working in the lime quarry; his\neyes were sensitive to sharp light. Mandela himself admitted \u2018there are signs of\nold age, wear and tear, which we must expect\u2019. But he described his health as\n\u2018reasonably good\u2019 and pointed out that each day he continued with the same set\nof rigorous exercises he had carried out in prison over the years. Concern about\nhis health was to mount in coming months as he put himself through a punishing\nschedule of rallies, meetings, press conference, interviews and long trips abroad.\nIn prison, Mandela\u2019s dream of what he would do when he was set free was to\n\n\ftake a leisurely drive to the Transkei, to visit the village of Qunu where he grew\nup and to wander in the hills and valleys where he had played as a boy. Yet so\ngreat were the demands upon him that it was to be several months before he\nmanaged to get to Qunu.\nWhat he craved for most of all was to resume the settled family life that he\nhad forsaken when he went underground in . Yet that too was to be denied\nhim. For Winnie, the focus of all his longing in prison, showed no interest in\nsharing the intimacies of married life with him. She had found a new lover, half\nher age, and she made it clear that she had no intention of giving him up.\nThus Mandela\u2019s homecoming did not bring the joy and happiness for which\nhad yearned so long. But as with all the other suffering he had endured, he hid\nthe pain and humiliation behind the mask which he had become accustomed to\nwearing.\n\nThe task facing Mandela was daunting. The ANC had been plunged into deep\ndisarray by the unexpected change in government policy. Its entire strategy for\nmore than twenty years had been based on plans for a revolutionary seizure of\npower, not on the possibility of peaceful negotiations. Trained guerrillas,\nbrought up on songs about how Um - khonto would march across the Limpopo\nto take Pretoria by storm, hankered for action. Many activists in the townships\nwere equally reluctant to forgo the prospect of revolution. Distrust of the\ngovernment\u2019s intentions was intense. Many were convinced that de Klerk\u2019s\nreforms were no more than a device to subvert the armed struggle. Within the\nANC\u2019s hierarchy in exile, there had long been disagreement between a small\ngroup amenable to the idea of negotiations and a far larger group committed to\narmed struggle outright. The Harare Declaration in August  setting out a\nhost of preconditions to negotiation had aroused fierce controversy which\nremained unresolved. This division between those who wanted to seize power\nand those who had advocated a negotiated compromise was to afflict the ANC\nfor years to come.\nMandela himself was distrusted. Rumours of his involvement in secret talks\nwith the government had led many to conclude that he had gone soft. \u2018The word\nwas,\u2019 said Mac Maharaj, \u2018that Madiba was wearing a three-piece suit, drinking\nwine, you name it, he was a sell-out.\u2019 Prominent activists inside South Africa\nquestioned his right to leadership and pointedly referred to him as \u2018an ordinary\n\n\fANC member\u2019.\nThe disarray within the ANC was compounded by the illness of Oliver\nTambo. In August , after presiding over the drafting of the Harare\nDeclaration, he had suffered a stroke, leaving him partially paralysed and\ndepriving the ANC of a guiding hand at a critical time. The vacuum in\nleadership still had to be filled.\nNew tensions emerged between the external wing of the ANC and its internal\nsurrogate, the United Democratic Front. In exile, the ANC had been used to\nacting as a secretive, autocratic organisation. Decisions had been taken by a\nrevolutionary council and passed down the chain of command. The covert nature\nof operations meant that there had been little room for dissent. Those who\nopposed the party were more than likely to be accused of being collaborators. Its\nheadquarters were a cramped, single-storey building off an alleyway in\ndowntown Lusaka, where it had gained a reputation for chronic inefficiency. Its\nguerrilla army was notably unsuccessful. The casualty rate for MK guerrillas\nentering South Africa was high; many of those who were captured were turned\ninto informers and used to assassinate colleagues. A senior defence force\nofficial, General Constand Viljoen, described MK as \u2018the weakest of enemies\u2019,\nwhile an internal ANC document produced in early  admitted, \u2018We do not\nhave the capacity within our country to intensify the armed struggle in a\nmeaningful way.\u2019 Yet the idea of revolution, of being a revolutionary\norganisation, still held immense appeal. The standing of Umkhonto within the\nliberation movement remained high. And the secretive, tightly-knit clique which\nhad made all the ANC\u2019s decisions for more than twenty years had no intention of\nletting their authority slip away.\nHowever, the internal leaders of the UDF, which had borne the brunt of the\nstruggle against the government during the s, were as determined as the\nANC\u2019s \u2018old guard\u2019 to maintain their own spheres of influence. As a coalition of\nmore than  groups, community organisations, youth groups and trade union\naffiliates, the UDF had evolved a tradition of politics that was highly democratic\nand decentralised, based on constant contact and discussion between officials\nand supporters and collective decision-making\u2014a style that was entirely alien to\nthe Lusaka exiles. Scores of local and regional leaders were used to operating\nfrom independent power bases of their own and were hostile to the idea of taking\norders from a national executive.\n\n\fThere were tensions too as different generations of leadership asserted\nthemselves: the elderly veterans of the s, like Mandela, emerging from\nyears of imprisonment; the Soweto generation of the s, who in exile had\nserved as guerrilla commissars; and the radical young leaders of the s\u2019\ninternal revolt, with their trade union allies, who had provided much of the\nbackbone of anti-government protest.\nMandela\u2019s task, after first re-establishing his own leadership credentials, was\nto weld this massive, disorganised and restless constituency into a coherent\npolitical force capable of negotiating a transfer of power from a government\npossessing huge advantages and determined to secure for itself all the power it\nfelt was needed to protect white interests.\nTwo weeks after his release, Mandela flew to Lusaka to give the ANC\u2019s\nhierarchy a full account of his dealings with the government and to convince\nthem that the time was right to pursue negotiations. There remained strong\ndistrust of the government\u2019s intentions, but Mandela succeeded in removing\ndoubts about his own role and in overcoming some of the resistance to the idea\nof negotiations. Of crucial importance, Mandela managed to win over\nUmkhonto\u2019s chief of staff, Chris Hani, a hardline guerrilla commander well\nknown for supporting attacks on white civilian targets. \u2018I think we\u2019re going to\nlearn from him that we need to be better South Africans,\u2019 said Hani, \u2018to forgive\nand forget and to look forward to building a new South Africa.\u2019\nMandela quickly became close to the ANC\u2019s old guard. He was nominated to\njoin the thirty-five members of the national executive committee based in\nLusaka and given the rank of deputy president. He felt more at ease in their\ncompany than in the rumbustious world of the UDF, where his freedom of\nleadership was constantly challenged. He possessed a strong authoritarian streak\nand a preference for taking action on his own responsibility, for dealing directly\nwith other leaders rather than waiting for consultations to be completed. His\nindependent style of leadership frequently brought him into conflict with party\nofficials inside South Africa, who insisted upon consultation and set out to curb\nhis autonomy of action. Outwardly, at press conference and public rallies,\nMandela appeared to speak with undisputed authority. In reality, he had to\nstruggle to assert his authority and was often outmanoeuvred.\nAmong the intrigues surrounding Mandela\u2019s leadership, Winnie was hard at\nwork with her own agenda, seeking to control access to her husband. She swiftly\n\n\ftook revenge on the group of prominent activists who had publicly condemned\nher involvement in the criminal activities of the Mandela Football Club,\nendeavouring to exclude them from the inner circle. Several people received\nthreatening telephone calls. \u2018Stay away from Mandela,\u2019 Winnie told one\nprominent activist, Azhur Cachalia. \u2018If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll see what will happen.\u2019\nWinnie also enlisted Mandela\u2019s help to further her own ambitions for high\noffice within the ANC. Her drive for party posts was unrelenting. She began by\nseeking election as head of the ANC branch and the Women\u2019s League in\nOrlando West to give her a local power base. Mandela dutifully went from door\nto door, calling on residents to vote for her. She then set her sights on regional\nand national posts. Mandela indulged her, seemingly oblivious of her true nature\nand also of the risks to his own reputation in doing so. The full horror of\nMandela United was soon to be played out in public during the trials of its\nmembers for murder.\nMandela also succumbed to pressure to move out of his \u2018matchbox\u2019 house in\nOrlando into Winnie\u2019s fifteen-room mansion in Diepkloof Extension which had\nhitherto remained empty. It was more appropriate to his needs, but he felt uneasy\nthere and it was never a place he came to regard as home.\nMuch of the time during his first months of freedom he travelled the world, to\nAfrica, Europe and North America, urging foreign governments to maintain the\npressure of sanctions, seeking funds for the ANC and thanking anti-apartheid\ngroups for their support over the years. Everywhere he went he was acclaimed a\npopular hero. In an age largely bereft of political morality, he was seen as a man\nof great moral authority, whose quarter-century of imprisonment for defying an\nevil system of government and for holding firm to the principles of democracy\ngave him a status no other politician could match. Western leaders\u2014President\nBush in Washington, Prime Minister Thatcher in London, President Mitterrand\nin Paris, Chancellor Kohl in Bonn, the Pope in Rome\u2014all accorded him a warm\nwelcome. He became the first private black citizen to address a joint session of\nthe United States Congress. Politicians and show-business personalities alike\nvied to be seen in his company. Special events were organised to celebrate his\nvisits\u2014a ticket tape parade in New York, a pop concert in London, a grand\nceremony on the terrasse of the Trocad\u00e9ro in Paris.\nThe only time Mandela stumbled on his triumphal progress was when he\ndecided to air his views on international affairs. In the United States, he spoke\n\n\fadmiringly of the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, and the Libyan leader, Colonel\nGaddafi, the foremost bogeymen of the United States administration. Both ran\ndictatorial regimes notable for human rights abuses, but both had given support\nto the ANC, so Mandela singled them out for praise: \u2018There is no reason\nwhatsoever why we should have any hesitation hailing their commitment to\nhuman rights.\u2019 When questioned on television about the morality of ignoring\nhuman rights violations in countries like Cuba and Libya, he replied, \u2018We are a\nliberation movement, which is fully involved in a struggle to emancipate our\npeople from one of the worst racist tyrannies the world has seen. We have no\ntime to be looking into the internal affairs of other countries.\u2019 The effect of these\nremarks on Mandela\u2019s reputation was instantaneous. \u2018You could positively hear\nhis Q-factor\u2014the attractiveness quotient with which America rates its celebrities\n\u2014crashing through the floor,\u2019 reported one correspondent.\nThe controversy soon passed, but it showed Mandela to be both na\u00efve and\nperverse. His principal purpose in visiting the United States was to gain the\nsupport of the Bush administration in maintaining sanctions against South\nAfrica, an issue which was of crucial importance to the ANC in its confrontation\nwith de Klerk\u2019s government. In speech after speech he stressed the need for\nsanctions to remain in place. But he swiftly undercut his own efforts by praising\nregimes regarded by the United States administration as its enemies and\ndamaged his moral authority by implying that human rights abuses in countries\nwhich supported him were none of his concern.\nHis travels also took him, finally, to Qunu. It had remained much as it had\nalways been, a scattered collection of circular thatched huts on a hillside close to\nthe main road leading to Umtata. There was still no electricity, no shops, no\nroads, just grass tracks linking the homesteads, and a cemetery where many of\nMandela\u2019s relatives were buried. Most of the inhabitants were old men, women\nand children, just as they had been during Mandela\u2019s childhood. But the poor\nsoil had since eroded and there was an unkempt air about the village.\nMandela had not seen it for thirty-four years. Many of his relatives there had\nnever set eyes on him or only dimly remembered him as a child. He arrived with\nWinnie in a black Mercedes, dressed impeccably in a dark blue suit, blue shirt\nand blue and yellow tie. The villagers lined up to greet him in their threadbare\nSunday suits, old-fashioned dresses and battered, mud-caked shoes. Before\ntaking part in a traditional homecoming feast, Mandela visited the simple grave\nof his mother, marked only by upturned bricks and stones in an open field below\n\n\fthe site where the family rondavel had once stood. It had been demolished after\nthe death of his mother in , as there had been no one to pay for its upkeep.\nMandela was struck by the poverty of the village: \u2018The poverty that was here\nwhen I last visited this place, that poverty is still there. My heart is very sore\nindeed on account of the poverty staring me in the face.\u2019\nIn the hope that one day he might come and live among them, the village\ncommunity awarded him a plot of land. Mandela welcomed the invitation and\nduly built a country house based on the design of his prison cottage at Victor\nVerster. When friends expressed surprise, Mandela explained that the Victor\nVerster house was the first spacious and comfortable house in which he had\nlived, he had liked it and had become accustomed to it.\n\nMeanwhile, preparations for a preliminary meeting between the ANC and the\ngovernment made hesitant progress. Each side was distrustful of the other. When\nthe ANC presented its list of delegates to the meeting, de Klerk was horrified to\nfind that it included Joe Slovo, general secretary of the Communist Party, whom\nthe government had regarded for years as the evil genius behind the ANC\u2019s\nterror campaign. In the government\u2019s eyes, he was \u2018Moscow\u2019s man\u2019, the chief\nlink between the Soviet Union and the ANC, the gatekeeper for Soviet arms,\nmoney and training. De Klerk insisted that Slovo should be excluded. Mandela\nrefused to give way, adamant that government would have no say in determining\nthe ANC\u2019s representatives.\nBut when in May  the two sides finally sat down together at Groote\nSchuur, the gabled mansion at the foot of Table Mountain in Cape Town which\nSouth Africa\u2019s prime ministers and presidents used as their official residence, the\natmosphere was unexpectedly cordial. The government\u2019s delegation consisted\nentirely of Afrikaners. The ANC\u2019s delegation comprised seven blacks, two\nwhites, one Coloured and one Indian; among them was Slovo, silver-haired,\nportly and looking more like a benign grandfather than a terrorist mastermind.\n\u2018Within a matter of minutes,\u2019 said a senior ANC official, \u2018everybody understood\nthat there was nobody in the room with horns.\u2019 Much was made of the personal\n\u2018chemistry\u2019 between de Klerk and Mandela. Though they came from different\nbackgrounds and different generations\u2014Mandela was seventy-one, de Klerk\nwas fifty-three\u2014Mandela respected de Klerk\u2019s credentials as an Afrikaner\nleader: de Klerk came from a powerful lineage, a matter to which Mandela\n\n\fattached considerable importance. \u2018I find him to be an honest person, very\ncapable and a strong leader,\u2019 remarked Mandela about de Klerk. \u2018He is sincere in\nhis efforts to bring about fundamental political changes in the country.\u2019\nIt was a promising beginning. Both sides emerged with a clear understanding\nof the obstacles that lay in the way of negotiations. The ANC wanted the\ngovernment first to lift the state of emergency, to allow political exiles to return\nhome and to release all political prisoners. The government wanted the ANC to\ndeclare an end to its armed struggle.\nIn June, de Klerk lifted the state of emergency. But further progress was\nimpeded by disputes over the return of exiles and the release of prisoners and by\nthe discovery by security police of an underground MK operation named\nOperation Vula, which had been kept secret from Mandela. When Mandela\nreturned from an overseas trip in July, he was determined to push the peace\nprocess forward. Political violence was on the increase; right-wing extremists\nwere gathering momentum. There was a clear danger of the process faltering\naltogether.\nSlovo had reached a similar conclusion. Though he was known more as a\nrevolutionary enthusiast than a pragmatic thinker, after long years in exile he had\ncome to recognise the advantage of using compromise to attain his objectives.\nHe believed that in order to create the right climate for negotiations, it was\nnecessary for the ANC to suspend the armed struggle unilaterally. De Klerk, he\nreasoned, needed to demonstrate some benefits from his reforms to appease his\ncritics, otherwise he would stall.\nWhen Slovo approached Mandela with the idea of suspending the armed\nstruggle, Mandela\u2019s first reaction was negative. But he soon realised that it\nwould provide him with the opportunity of seizing the initiative from de Klerk.\nIf the proposal came from Slovo it would carry far greater authority with the\nANC than if it came from him. He was already under suspicion of having \u2018gone\nsoft\u2019, but Slovo\u2019s revolutionary credentials were beyond reproach and he would\ncarry the day.\nAt a meeting of the ANC\u2019s national executive committee in July, Slovo made\nhis proposal and Mandela supported him. There were fierce objections, but after\nseveral hours their view prevailed. On  August, at a meeting in Pretoria, the\nANC signed an agreement suspending the armed struggle launched nearly thirty\nyears before.\n\n\fThe practical effect of the Pretoria Minute, as it was known, was negligible.\nUmkhonto had long since halted guerrilla operations. But the rhetoric of\nrevolution was deeply rooted among the mass of ANC supporters. Many looked\nupon themselves as soldiers of the revolution. By abandoning the armed\nstruggle, Mandela provoked a furore within the movement. Slovo calculated that\n per cent of ANC supporters considered the decision to be a \u2018sell-out\u2019.\nMilitants attacked Mandela\u2019s liking for \u2018personal diplomacy\u2019 with de Klerk and\nset out to curb his room for manoeuvre.\nBut even as the row was underway, it was overshadowed by a far greater\ncrisis emerging from the green rolling hills of Natal, where a vicious struggle for\npower had developed centred on the controversial leader of the KwaZulu\nhomeland, Mangosuthu Buthelezi.\n\n.

Passing the baton: Mandela with Thabo Mbeki, pictured in  THE THIRD MAN\nIN THE EARLY DAYS, BUTHELEZI REMAINED ON GOOD TERMS\nWITH THE exiled leaders of the ANC. When he launched the Inkatha\nmovement in , they regarded it as a useful ally in the anti-apartheid\ncampaign. They also approved his election in  as KwaZulu\u2019s chief minister,\nconfident that he would prove to be a stumbling block to the government\u2019s drive\nto establish \u2018independent\u2019 homelands. But the relationship turned sour in ,\nafter Buthelezi met Oliver Tambo in London, with the ANC accusing Buthelezi\nof building Inkatha into \u2018a personal power base\u2019 and Buthelezi accusing the\nANC of trying to hijack Inkatha for its own ends.\nDuring the s, the feud became increasingly acrimonious. From the\ngovernment\u2019s standpoint, Buthelezi was no moderate. His demands for the\nrelease of Mandela and other political prisoners, for the lifting of the ban on the\nANC, for the abolition of all apartheid measures and for negotiations for a new\nconstitution were no different from those made by radical groups like the UDF.\nBut, to the fury of radical activists, he vociferously opposed the armed struggle,\nsanctions and disinvestment and praised the free enterprise system. The ANC\nand UDF dismissed him as a traitor to the nationalist cause. Buthelezi, for his\npart, resented any challenge to his authority. In a letter to Oliver Tambo in ,\nhe wrote: \u2018In this part of South Africa, we come from warrior stock and there is\na resilient determination in KwaZulu and in Inkatha which even the full might of\nthe state will never be able to flatten. Do your colleagues really think they can\nflatten us on the way to their envisaged victory?\u2019 As the townships\u2019 revolt got\nunder way, the level of rhetoric reached new heights. From Lusaka, the ANC\ndenounced Buthelezi as \u2018a counter-revolutionary\u2019, \u2018a puppet\u2019, and \u2018a snake\npoisoning the people of South Africa [which] needs to be hit on the head\u2019.\nOnce regarded as the most popular African politician in the country, Buthelezi\nshowed signs of losing his support. One opinion poll concluded that between\n and  Inkatha\u2019s support in the Witwatersrand region, the industrial\nheartland of South Africa, declined from more than  to less than  per cent.\n\n\fEven more serious for Buthelezi, there were clear indications that Inkatha\u2019s\nsupport in its home base of KwaZulu-Natal was rapidly eroding, notably among\nurban blacks. Pro-ANC youth groups and trade unions were becoming\nincreasingly active. In , Inkatha embarked on a recruitment drive.\nThe ugly contest that followed engulfed KwaZulu and Natal in spasms of\nviolence for years to come. Buthelezi possessed considerable advantages. Since\nthe s, he had run KwaZulu from his capital at Ulundi as a one-party state,\ncontrolling its parliament, its police and its civil service. As a member of the\nZulu royal family, he could rely on the support of a powerful network of Zulu\ntraditional chiefs\u2014amakhosi\u2014whom he in turn rewarded with power and\nprivilege. The Zulu system of loyalty and obedience to its hierarchy assured\nButhelezi of bedrock support among more traditionally minded communities,\nparticularly those in the deep rural areas of KwaZulu. Migrant workers on the\nWitwatersrand, coming from those rural areas, bore him the same allegiance. His\nparty, Inkatha, was a well-organised political movement with a clear hierarchy\nand chain of command, able to hold regular meetings and rallies. It drew support\nfrom the Zulu establishment, from chiefs, councillors, legislative assembly\nmembers, indunas, businessmen, civil servants and other government employees.\nIn , it established a trade union wing, the United Workers\u2019 Union of South\nAfrica, Uwusa, in an endeavour to compete with the pro-ANC Congress of\nSouth African Trade Unions, Cosatu. Above all, it could count on the support of\nthe KwaZulu police, which had been established in  and which Buthelezi, as\nminister of police, had turned into a formidable paramilitary force. In addition to\nregular policemen, special kitkonstabels were recruited, mainly from the ranks of\nInkatha, some with criminal records. They were given limited training, then sent\nback to their communities, armed with pump-action shotguns. \u2018We must prepare\nourselves not only to defend property and life, but to go beyond that and prepare\nourselves to hit back with devastating force at those who destroy our property\nand kill us,\u2019 Buthelezi told the KwaZulu legislative assembly in . The\nfollowing year, Inkatha\u2019s central committee resolved that the whole of KwaZulu\nand Natal should be turned into a \u2018no-go area\u2019 for the UDF \u2018regardless of\nconsequence\u2019.\nIn meeting the challenge posed by pro-ANC activists in the s, Buthelezi\nand the government found themselves making common cause. Buthelezi was\ngiven every encouragement to deal forcefully with the threat. In , he\nsecretly arranged for army training in the Caprivi Strip for a covert paramilitary\n\n\fforce of  men able to undertake offensive operations against pro-ANC\nactivists. When pro-ANC groups began to make headway in the Natal Midlands\nin , heavy police reinforcements were deployed to help curb them. At a\npolice ceremony in the provincial capital, Pietermaritzburg, in , the minister\nof law and order, Adriaan Vlok, declared, \u2018The police intend to face the future\nwith moderates and fight against radical groups. . . . Radicals, who are trying to\ndestroy South Africa, will not be tolerated. We will fight them. We have put our\nfoot in that direction, and we will eventually win the Pietermaritzburg area.\u2019\nButhelezi\u2019s strategy was to appeal to Zulu pride and sense of martial tradition,\nand to assert the notion that the Zulu people and Inkatha were synonymous.\nZulus, he said, were a \u2018mighty nation\u2019 with a \u2018glorious heritage\u2019 who needed to\nstand together in the face of enemies who did not want \u2018the Zulu nation to unite\u2019.\nHe liked to recount how he had learned politics at his mother\u2019s knee, listening to\ntales of Zulu resistance to British settlers in the nineteenth century and how his\ngreat-grandfather, Cetshwayo, had routed the British army at the battle of\nIsandhlwana in . In public, he frequently appeared in traditional Zulu dress,\ndraping a leopard skin across his shoulders and holding a shield, a stick and a\ngleaming spear in his hand.\nHis opponents in Natal were Zulus from the ranks of urban blacks, from\ncommunity groups, the landless, the unemployed and, above all, the youth, all\nstruggling for survival in crowded shack settlements and townships and resentful\nof the power and patronage enjoyed by the Zulu establishment. The numbers of\nthis constituency were forever swelling. Between  and , the population\nof greater Durban more than trebled from under  million to  million.\nThe ANC\u2019s main organiser in this Zulu civil war was its Natal Midlands boss,\nHarry Gwala, a modern-day Stalinist and former Robben Island prisoner who\nhad clashed with Mandela there. A diminutive man in his late sixties and\nsuffering from motor neurone disease, which left him partially paralysed, with\narms hanging limply from his sides, he was driven by a hatred for Buthelezi and\nall that he stood for. Gwala wanted a military victory over Buthelezi and\nharboured dreams of marching on Ulundi to occupy his headquarters. His\nuncompromising militancy made him the hero of the ANC\u2019s youth in the region.\nThe conflict became essentially territorial. Inkatha leaders, usually known as\n\u2018warlords\u2019, formed armed groups\u2014\u2018impis\u2019\u2014to drive out their opponents.\nRadical pro-ANC groups responded in kind. Gwala publicly declared that\n\n\fInkatha warlords should be killed. Hit squads operating in his area, some of them\nbelonging to Umkhonto, succeeded in wiping out scores of middle-ranking\nInkatha officials. Police were frequently accused of collusion in Inkatha attacks,\nof harassing radical groups but failing to deal with the activities of warlords and\nknown killers and of standing by while the impis went to work. Attackers were\nsometimes transported, heavily armed, in buses in broad daylight. Assassinations\nwere commonplace; massacres were carried out. Many areas became \u2018no-go\u2019\nareas for one side or the other. Mixed in with this political rivalry were the\nactivities of criminal gangs and violent disputes over land, water and housing.\nBy , more than , people had been killed.\nIn prison, Mandela had been confident of being able to settle the conflict once\nhe was set free. He knew of Buthelezi\u2019s difficult nature. Everyone who had had\ndealings with Buthelezi found him to be a prickly personality, volatile,\nunpredictable, hyper-sensitive and at times paranoid. But Mandela believed that\na personal meeting would enable them to resolve their differences. He was\ncareful to keep in touch with him, writing respectful letters. When he left prison,\nBu - thelezi was one of the first people whom he phoned, to thank him for his\nlong campaign to secure his release. At his first press conference, he steered\nclear of the usual ANC rhetoric:\nWe have differences with Dr Buthelezi. Firstly, on the question of violence.\nSecondly, on the attitude towards government structures. And thirdly, on the\nquestion of sanctions. These are fundamental differences, but nevertheless, he is\na figure with a following. It may not be as big and may not command as much\nresources as we command, but he has a following and it seems to me correct to\ntry and settle problems in which he is involved amicably.\nWithin days of his release, Mandela proposed that they should meet. But he\nran straight into vehement opposition from the ANC\u2019s national executive\ncommittee. Mandela said he thought they would \u2018throttle\u2019 him for suggesting it.\nDetermined to make contact nevertheless, Mandela urged Walter Sisulu to\ntake up an invitation to visit the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelethini, who was also\nButhelezi\u2019s nephew. \u2018Mandela believed that we needed Buthelezi, we needed the\nking, we needed the Zulus,\u2019 Sisulu recalled. But an immediate dispute broke out\nover the venue of the meeting. Zwelethini had invited Sisulu to meet him at\nUlundi, but the ANC was wary of according any hint of recognition to the\nKwaZulu homeland by visiting the capital. Sisulu proposed instead a meeting at\n\n\fthe king\u2019s palace at Nongoma, but Zwelethini saw no reason to agree to the\nchange. And so another opportunity for peace was lost. Sisulu subsequently\nconceded that it had probably been a mistake for him to refuse to go to Ulundi.\nButhelezi\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, considered that the king had been snubbed,\nresulting in another bout of violence.\nMandela\u2019s efforts at exerting leadership over the crisis came to nothing. Two\nweeks after his release, he addressed a huge rally of ANC supporters in Durban,\nurging an end to the fighting. South Africa, he said, stood on the threshold of a\nnew era but Natal was in flames, \u2018brother fighting brother in wars of vengeance\nand retaliation\u2019. He made a dramatic appeal to all Zulus to lay down their arms:\n\u2018Take your guns, your knives and your pangas [machetes] and throw them into\nthe sea. Close down the death factories. End this war.\u2019\nBut no one paid much attention. Gwala argued publicly that the quickest way\nto establish peace throughout Natal was to win the war against Inkatha. He cited\nas examples of a \u2018peaceful solution\u2019 several Midlands areas that had become\ntotally peaceful after his supporters had killed or chased away all Inkatha\nmembers.\nAfter another round of slaughter in March, Mandela and Buthelezi agreed to\nmeet outside Pietermaritzburg at a rural settlement called Taylor\u2019s Halt, an\nInkatha stronghold in the KwaZulu homeland. Announcing his decision,\nMandela said that when people were dying there was no time to stand on\nceremony. \u2018We must unite,\u2019 he said. But Gwala and other ANC leaders in Natal\nwere enraged by the announcement, all the more so as they had not been\nconsulted beforehand. Early the next morning, they confronted Mandela at his\nSoweto home, warning him that if he went ahead with the Taylor\u2019s Halt meeting,\nit would result only in boosting Buthelezi\u2019s prestige and in convincing him that\nviolence paid political dividends. Mandela made his planned trip to\nPietermaritzburg, but never went to Taylor\u2019s Halt and never met Buthelezi.\nInstead, Gwala\u2019s men took him to a local township to see the charred remains of\nan ANC supporter and to meet distraught families of the latest victims.\nThe snub to Buthelezi was fatal. \u2018It was important for Buthelezi to feel\nwelcomed, embraced and part of the process,\u2019 reflected Jacob Zuma, the ANC\u2019s\nintelligence chief, himself a Zulu. If Mandela had embraced him right at the\nbeginning, he believed, the conflict could have been overcome. By allowing\nGwala to dictate terms, Mandela lost a crucial opportunity for reconciliation.\n\n\fButhelezi drew his own conclusions. \u2018They think they are going to marginalise\nme,\u2019 he said. \u2018They say Inkatha must be smashed and finished. . . . It is not\npossible.\u2019\nThe conflict now spread beyond Natal. In protest against the continuing\nviolence in the region, the ANC and its trade union ally, Cosatu, organised an\n\u2018isolate Buthelezi\u2019 campaign which, on  July, brought  million workers out on\na \u2018stay-away\u2019, closing most factories in Natal. Inkatha was proclaimed \u2018an\nenemy of the people\u2019. In the Transvaal townships, the houses of many Inkatha\nofficials, notably township councillors, were petrol-bombed.\nOn  July, Buthelezi took the initiative. He turned Inkatha into a fully\nfledged political party, the Inkatha Freedom Party, opened its membership to all\nraces and launched a recruitment campaign in the Transvaal, concentrating on\ntownship hostels along the Reef. What followed became known as the Reef\ntownship war, which brought a level of violence to South Africa that had never\nbeen witnessed before.\nThe hostels were a natural recruiting ground for Inkatha. More than fifty\nhostels in townships in the East Rand and West Rand were occupied mainly by\nZulu-speaking workers from rural areas of Kwa - Zulu and Natal who had come\nto the Reef in search of work. The conditions in which they lived were appalling.\nThe hostels were generally overcrowded, squalid and insanitary blocks providing\nonly rudimentary facilities. Township residents tended to sneer at people who\nlived there. But for the occupants they offered a vital base from which to earn a\nliving. Coming mostly from a traditional rural background, they tended to resent\nthe undisciplined behaviour of township youths. They were notably hostile to the\ncoercive tactics used by radical groups in the townships to enforce boycotts,\nstay-aways and other forms of anti-apartheid protest. The only reason hostel\ndwellers endured such grim places was to work and earn money for their\nfamilies in rural areas, for most homesteads in rural Zululand were dependent on\nremittances from migrants in Johannesburg. Their fears about the ANC were\naggravated by demands made by local ANC leaders at public rallies that hostel\ndwellers should vacate hostels to make way for returning exiles who needed a\nhome, and by suggestions that hostels should be upgraded to family units, which\nmight also have led to single migrants being thrown out. Inkatha officials\nexploited these fears, warning hostel residents that they were in danger of losing\ntheir \u2018homes\u2019 as a means of gaining support. To complicate matters further, there\nwas the ethnic factor. For years, permanent residents and hostel dwellers,\n\n\fwhether of Zulu, Xhosa or mixed origin, had lived together peaceably. But\nInkatha now used Zulu allegiance as the basis of its recruitment campaign. Its\nadversaries in the squatter settlements surrounding hostels were often Xhosas\nsupporting the ANC. Ethnic tensions rapidly mounted. Rumours abounded of\nimminent attack by Zulu or by Xhosa fighters.\nOn  July, the Reef township war broke out. It started in Sebokeng, a\ntownship thirty-five miles south of Johannesburg, in a battle between residents\nand hostel dwellers which flared up shortly after an Inkatha rally was held there.\nThe ANC had forewarning that Inkatha attacks were planned. ANC lawyers had\nwritten both to the minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok, and to local police\ncommanders, urging them to ban the rally, but to no avail. In the morning,\nbusloads of Inkatha supporters arrived from Johannesburg hostels armed with\nwhat were known as \u2018traditional weapons\u2019\u2014spears, clubs, axes and iron bars. In\nthe violence that followed, some thirty people were killed, mostly ANC\nsupporters.\nThe next day, Mandela went to the Sebokeng morgue and then visited the\nhospital to express his solidarity with the survivors. His anger about what had\nhappened was directed not so much against Inkatha and Buthelezi as against de\nKlerk. At a meeting with the president on  July, Mandela demanded an\nexplanation: \u2018I said, \u201cYou were warned beforehand. You did nothing about it.\nWhy? Why is it there have been no arrests? In any other country, where thirtytwo people had been slaughtered in this way, the head of state would come out\ncondemning the matter and giving his sympathies to the next of kin. Why have\nyou not done so?\u201d\u2019 According to Mandela, de Klerk could offer no proper\nresponse, nor did he provide him with any explanation.\nThe violence spread rapidly from one township to another as hostel dwellers\nlaunched attacks on nearby squatter settlements and residential areas, setting off\nendless cycles of revenge and retaliation. Within days several hundred were\ndead. Zulu hostel dwellers expelled Xhosa-speakers and other non-Zulus from\nhostels, turning them into Zulu fortresses. Zulu families in surrounding areas,\nfacing persecution, sought protection there. As communities split, Zulus came to\nbe identified as Inkatha supporters and Xhosas as ANC supporters, regardless of\ntheir real allegiances. Many Zulu-speakers living near hostels were forced to\nalign themselves with hostel dwellers as their only means of defence against\nrevenge attacks by township residents. Thousands abandoned their shacks and\nhomes to escape the violence. Some townships became divided into rival\n\n\fterritories, with large \u2018nogo\u2019 areas of wrecked and deserted houses separating\nthem. In August,  people died over an eleven-day period.\nThe role of the police, as in Natal, became increasingly controversial. Police\nrefused to disarm Zulu impis of their spears, axes, knives, sticks and iron bars,\non the grounds that these were traditional weapons that Zulus were entitled to\ncarry. They were also accused of standing by while hostel dwellers launched\ntheir murderous raids into surrounding territory or of actually assisting them.\nThere had been a long history of brutal conflict between police and radical\ngroups in the townships. The two sides had, in effect, been at war since the\nSoweto revolt of . To many in the police, the ANC was still \u2018the enemy\u2019\nand a justifiable target for Inkatha supporters.\nBut the suspicion soon grew that something more sinister was happening. In\nSeptember, twenty-six people died and more than  were injured when a sixman gang ran through a Johannesburg commuter train shooting passengers at\nrandom; a second gang, lying in wait on a station platform, attacked survivors\ntrying to escape from the train. The attack had all the hallmarks of the kind of\nterrorist activity carried out for years in Mozambique by rebels trained and\nsupported by South African military intelligence.\nAll this coincided with a wave of public disclosures about dirty-tricks\noperations conducted by police and army units in the s and s in their\ncampaign against the ANC and other government opponents. In October , a\nblack policeman, under sentence of death for the murder of a white farmer,\nearned a stay of execution by claiming that he had been a member of a security\npolice assassination squad set up to eliminate government opponents. He\nidentified its commander as Captain Dirk Coetzee. The following month,\nCoetzee, having fled the country, admitted his involvement with assassination\nsquads during the s and s. He had commanded a special counterinsurgency unit based at a secluded police farm called Vlakplaas, west of\nPretoria, where hit squads comprised of ANC defectors and Mozambique rebels\nwere trained and used in neighbouring states and inside South Africa for\nclandestine operations, including murder, abduction and bomb attacks. He\nclaimed that assassination squads were still at work. In March , an official\ninquiry into the conduct of the security forces, the Harms Commission, which de\nKlerk eventually agreed to set up with limited terms of reference, was told of\nsimilar activities at home and abroad carried out by a defence force covert unit\nknown as the Civil Cooperation Bureau, established during the s. The unit\n\n\fwas still active, with an annual budget of  million rands. The verdict of the\ninquiry was that the CCB operated as a law unto itself and had its own political\nagenda. Its actions had \u2018contaminated the whole security arm of the state\u2019. In\nJuly , the government announced that the unit would be disbanded.\nWith all this evidence of security force involvement in murder and dirty tricks\nat hand, it seemed all the more plausible, in the wake of several train massacres\nand attacks on squatter settlements, to suspect a conspiracy of right-wing\nelements in the military and the police bent on wrecking the negotiation process.\nMandela raised the question of a \u2018third force\u2019 with de Klerk in private in August.\nIn September, he voiced his concern publicly, suggesting that renegades in the\nsecurity forces were trying to disrupt negotiations.\nDe Klerk\u2019s predicament was considerable. He was an outsider to the security\nestablishment. During the decade of total strategy, when defence and security\nofficials were given a free hand to run guerrilla operations in Mozambique and\nAngola and mount whatever dirty tricks they considered necessary inside South\nAfrica, de Klerk was preoccupied with domestic issues like education. When he\nbecame president, he had never held a security portfolio. Unlike Botha, he had\nno inside knowledge of how the security establishment worked, nor did he share\nthe sense of camaraderie that prevailed there. Along with a large section of the\nNational Party, he disliked the way in which the security establishment had\ntended to usurp the role of parliament and the National Party itself. Soon after\ntaking office, he had dispensed with the elaborate system of national security\nmanagement which Botha had constructed as part of his total strategy. But key\npersonnel wedded to that strategy were still in place, not only within the security\nestablishment but also within his own cabinet, including the minister of defence,\nMagnus Malan, and the minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok. They believed\nthe \u2018enemy\u2019 was still the ANC and its communist allies and acted accordingly.\nSecurity bosses had also become ac - customed to operating autonomously. As\nthe Harms inquiry noted, the CCB had ignored requests from the president, the\nminister of defence and the chief of the defence force: \u2018Requests by parliament,\nthe auditor-general and the commission were treated with contempt.\u2019 At cabinet\nmeetings, when de Klerk raised questions about the third force, Malan and Vlok\nwere quick to dismiss it as propaganda. De Klerk had no interest in pursuing the\nmatter. He depended heavily on the security establishment to keep tight control\nof the turbulence churned up by his reforms and feared antagonising them. All\nhe was prepared to admit was that \u2018a few rogue individuals\u2019 might be involved.\n\n\fOtherwise, he stuck to the standard government explanation for the violence that\nit was all caused by \u2018black-on-black\u2019 rivalry.\nMandela was unable to believe that de Klerk did not possess the power to\nclean up the security forces and to put a stop to the violence.\nBut initially he was willing to attribute his failure to do so to de Klerk\u2019s\n\u2018problems with his own constituency\u2019. In November , after a massive\nInkatha attack on a squatter camp known as Zonkizizwe, outside Germiston on\nthe East Rand, which resulted in a rout of all residents and its occupation by\nInkatha supporters, Mandela went to see de Klerk and Vlok to ask why the\npolice had taken no action to restore the shacks to their original owners. De\nKlerk, according to Mandela, seemed totally unaware of the incident. But Vlok\u2019s\nresponse was to ask rudely, \u2018Who owned the land anyway on which your people\nwere living? \u2019 The land, in fact, belonged to the local authority, which had made\nit available for squatters generally. De Klerk promised to investigate the matter,\nbut though Mandela repeatedly brought up the issue of Zonkizizwe with de\nKlerk in the following months, he never received any response.\nTheir relationship nevertheless remained in good working order. In a press\ninterview in December , Mandela said:\nI still regard de Klerk as a man of integrity, and I think he feels the same about\nme. We have developed enormous respect for each other. I can call him at any\ntime. I can get him out of bed or out of cabinet meetings. I believe he and\nperhaps the majority of his cabinet are still as committed to the peace process as\nwe are. But he has problems with elements inside his government\u2014especially\nhis security establishment, which is riddled with right-wingers who are not with\nhim at all\u2014and he is not being frank with me about that.\nFor month after month the clashes continued, with varying degrees of intensity.\nPolice action to stamp out the violence merely curbed it temporarily. Not only\nhad it become endemic but there were signs that it was escalating out of control.\nSince the s, a culture of violence had developed among successive\ngenerations of black youths. They had been at the forefront of the Soweto\nuprising of the s and the township revolt of the s. At each stage the use\nof violence had become more widespread and more extreme. For over a decade\ntheir schooling had been disrupted by boycotts, protests and street battles. They\nhad become known as \u2018the lost generation\u2019. But they were also a generation\nwhich had experienced raw power.\n\n\fNow, in the political struggles of the s, the same atmosphere of\nrevolutionary violence prevailed. Mandela himself had helped stoke up the mood\nof defiance, declaring, in his first public address after his release from prison, the\nneed for the armed struggle to continue. For months on end, as the ANC\nendeavoured to bolster its standing in confronting the government, it flaunted the\nrhetoric of armed struggle, giving township activists licence to pursue opponents\nat will. Their targets were often township councillors supporting Inkatha and\nlocal police. In the first seven months of , more than  attacks on black\ncouncillors and police were recorded. Necklace executions once again became\ncommonplace. Guns, in particular AK-s, were now readily available,\nsmuggled in mainly from Mozambique and Angola. The townships were hit not\njust by political violence but by a soaring crime rate.\nThe Reef war added a new dimension. In response to the ferocious attacks\norganised by hostel dwellers, young comrades in surrounding residential areas\nand squatter camps set up self-defence units with the help of Umkhonto. Some\nSDUs succeeded in offering protection for local communities, but others waged\nan often indiscriminate war of retribution on hostel dwellers, widening the cycle\nof violence. Some broke up into factions and engaged in their own form of\nterritorial warfare; others were taken over by criminal gangs, becoming\nnotorious for extortion, rape and murder, and adding to the soaring level of\nviolent crime. All lacked political control. At the base of this anarchic activity\nwas a vast underclass of youths roaming the streets\u2014unskilled, unemployed,\nundisciplined, fed on revolutionary slogans, but now angry and resentful of how\nlittle the revolution had brought them.\nMandela endeavoured to address some of these issues at his public rallies. \u2018I\nmust make it clear that the level of crime in our country must be eliminated,\u2019 he\nsaid on his homecoming to Soweto. \u2018All students must return to school and\nlearn.\u2019 But such simple exhortations were lost in the maelstrom.\nMandela\u2019s belated efforts to reach an accommodation with Buthelezi were no\nmore successful. After hundreds of deaths, the ANC\u2019s national executive\ncommittee agreed in September  to a summit meeting between Mandela and\nButhelezi. But it was not until the end of January , after hundreds more\ndeaths, that it finally took place, at Durban\u2019s Royal Hotel.\nButhelezi was in a truculent mood. Before arriving in Durban, he had\ncollected together statements made by ANC officials vilifying him from the\n\n\fprevious five years and he proceeded to read them out, page by page, to the\nassembled delegates and the media. He then catalogued all the political\ndifferences separating Inkatha and the ANC.\nMandela chose not to respond in kind. In his own speech, he went out of his\nway to appease Buthelezi, thanking him for his efforts to secure his release from\nprison and emphasising the common goals of their two organisations. The\nsummit ended with the signing of what was supposed to be a peace agreement\nsetting out a code of conduct for dealing with each other. But neither side\npossessed the will to make it work. Within weeks, hundreds more had died.\nThe government blamed the ANC and Inkatha. The ANC blamed the\ngovernment. Inkatha and the ANC each blamed the police for supporting the\nopposing faction. The police still refused to disarm Zulus carrying traditional\nweapons. And so the killing went on.\nBut Mandela\u2019s attitude towards de Klerk changed. He began to suspect that de\nKlerk was pursuing a \u2018double agenda\u2019\u2014talking to the ANC while at the same\ntime supporting the violent activities of its opponents. Every plea he made to de\nKlerk for help in protecting ANC victims, like the Zonkizizwe squatters, failed\nto get any response. Time and again, de Klerk would promise to \u2018investigate\u2019 but\ndid nothing. Mandela\u2019s own standing among his supporters was being\nundermined as a result. He began to fear that he had put too much trust in de\nKlerk, as his critics in the ANC had argued all along.\nIn March , Inkatha launched attacks in Alexandra township, north of\nJohannesburg, and succeeded in gaining control of the Madala Hostel, a massive\nbuilding standing on a hill overlooking the township, which had formerly been\noccupied by migrant workers from mixed ethnic groups. In three days of\nfighting, forty-five people were killed. The government belatedly sent in police\nand army reinforcements and declared Alexandra to be an \u2018unrest area\u2019 subject\nto emergency control. Despite this, one week later, Inkatha was allowed to hold\na political rally there. Busloads of supporters, many armed with traditional\nweapons, arrived from other areas. Six more people died that day. One week\nlater, at Daveytown, east of Johannesburg, police opened fire on an ANC\ndemonstration, causing at least twelve deaths.\nThe ANC was besieged with pleas for help, yet still Mandela could not get a\nresponse from de Klerk. At a private symposium in Cape Town on  April\norganised for visiting members of the United States Congress, Mandela launched\n\n\finto a tirade against de Klerk, accusing him of connivance in the violence. He\nhad betrayed his trust, he said, and ignored his requests for help. The following\nday, at a meeting of the ANC\u2019s national executive committee, Mandela\napologised for the misjudgement he said he had made of de Klerk. His critics, he\nsaid, had been right all along.\nMandela never regained his trust of de Klerk. Their personal relationship\nhenceforth was marked more by abrasive encounters than signs of cooperation.\nMandela now joined others on the national executive committee in advocating a\ntougher line. In an open letter to the government, the ANC warned that talks\nwould be suspended in May unless the government agreed to seven demands.\nThese included the dismissal of Malan and Vlok; the dismantling of all army\ncounter-insurgency units; the banning of the carrying of traditional weapons in\npublic; the phasing out of migrant-worker hostels; and the appointment of an\nindependent commission to investigate complaints of police misconduct.\nDe Klerk\u2019s response was to call a multiparty conference on violence in May.\nBut the ANC boycotted it on the grounds that the government already knew\nwhat to do to bring the violence to an end. De Klerk in turn accused the ANC of\n\u2018playing politics\u2019 while parts of the country were left \u2018ankle-deep in blood\u2019.\nThe evidence of security force involvement in the mayhem, meanwhile,\nsteadily mounted. Press investigations revealed the fact that  Inkatha hit-men\nhad been trained secretly by South African military intelligence in the Caprivi\nStrip in , before being deployed in Natal and the Transvaal. Buthelezi\nconfirmed the training, but said the men had been attached to KwaZulu officials\nto act as bodyguards. A former army sergeant alleged that a special forces unit\nhad been involved in train massacres and a string of other incidents. In June\n, a former military intelligence officer claimed that the army was fully\ninvolved in the funding and supply of weapons to Inkatha with the aim of\nfanning violence. A defence force spokesman dismissed the allegations as\n\u2018ridiculous\u2019, but in July , in what became known as Inkathagate, the\ngovernment was forced to admit that it had secretly channelled funds to Inkatha\nand its affiliated trade union, Uwusa. Government funding for Uwusa had been\ngoing on since its establishment six years previously. In the case of Inkatha, the\nsecurity police had given funds to help it organise two political rallies, one in\nNovember  and the other in March , to shore up support for Buthelezi.\nIn an internal police memorandum, Major Louis Botha, head of the Durban\nsecurity police, reported that Buthelezi had thanked him profusely for the funds\n\n\fand signed a receipt for them.\nDe Klerk\u2019s reputation at home and abroad was irreparably damaged by the\ndisclosures. No longer did his denials that he was pursuing a \u2018double agenda\u2019\ncarry much weight. The worldwide acclaim he had received for launching his\nreforms now seemed to belong to another era.\nButhelezi\u2019s reputation suffered as well. For all his claims of independent\nleadership, he was shown up to be dependent on hand-outs from Pretoria.\nInkatha, claimed Mandela, had \u2018permitted itself to become an extension of the\nPretoria regime, its instrument and surrogate\u2019.\nFor Mandela too, the disclosures caused considerable embarrassment,\nproviding ammunition for radical critics who questioned his judgement. He was\ndeeply shocked by the cavalier way in which de Klerk tried to gloss over the\nscandal and continued to dismiss his complaints about security force\ninvolvement in \u2018third force\u2019 activity. \u2018We believed,\u2019 he said, \u2018that President de\nKlerk was a man of integrity. But subsequent events have shown that perhaps we\nwere hasty and that there was a little bit of na\u00efvety on our part because he has\nturned out to be a totally different man from what he was initially.\u2019\n\n \fCHAPTER \nWINNIE\u2019S TRIAL\nTHE DRAMA OF THE MANDELA FOOTBALL CLUB WAS MEANWHILE\nbeing played out in the courts. Winnie\u2019s name figured prominently in one trial\nafter another, but the government was wary of taking action against her, anxious\nto avoid any embarrassment that could damage the fragile peace process. \u2018We\nare proceeding carefully, so as not to give any indication that we are acting\nvindictively against Mrs Mandela,\u2019 said the minister of law and order, Adriaan\nVlok. \u2018It is also very difficult for the police to find witnesses prepared to testify\nagainst her. In the past, such witnesses have either suddenly changed their minds\nor just disappeared.\u2019\nA serious difficulty arose in January , two weeks before Mandela\u2019s\nrelease, when Sizwe Sithole, the head of the \u2018disciplinary committee\u2019 based at\nWinnie\u2019s house and the father of Zindzi\u2019s three-month-old son, was found dead\nin a police shower room. Arrested on an arms charge, Sithole had spent nearly\nfour hours telling police at Protea station about a number of serious crimes he\nsaid involved Winnie and Zindzi. A commission of inquiry under Judge Richard\nGoldstone which the government swiftly set up to investigate Sithole\u2019s death\nfound that he had committed suicide, a verdict that no one disputed. One of the\nmain reasons Goldstone gave for Sithole\u2019s suicide was that he had been\novercome by remorse for having implicated Winnie and Zindzi. The police went\nto considerable lengths to keep Winnie\u2019s name out of the affair and took no\naction on the evidence they had been given.\nThe main body of evidence against Winnie emerged during the trial of the\nfootball club\u2019s coach, Jerry Richardson, for the murder of Stompie Moeketsi\nSeipei. The trial had originally been due to start in February , the day after\nMandela\u2019s release from prison, but it was postponed until May . Richardson\nwas the only person accused of the murder, but six others were charged on four\ncounts of kidnapping and four counts of assault with intent to cause grievous\nbodily harm. The state prosecutors planned to bring charges against Winnie if\n\n\fthe case against Richardson resulted in a conviction.\nWinnie did not appear in court. She had declined to testify as a witness,\nignoring requests from Richardson\u2019s attorney to take the stand on his behalf. But\neven in her absence, she overshadowed the proceedings. In their evidence, the\nthree kidnap victims\u2014Kenny Kgase, Thabiso Mono and Pelo Mekgwe\u2014related\nhow Winnie had told them they were not fit to be alive; how she accused\nStompie of being a sell-out; how she beat them using her fists and then whips;\nand how members of the football team joined in afterwards.\nRichardson, for his part, denied killing Stompie. He also denied that Winnie\nhad been present on  December , when Stompie and the other kidnap\nvictims were brought to her house. But his testimony was riddled with lies.\nWhen his defence counsel, Henti Joubert, came to sum up, he admitted\nRichardson had lied to protect Winnie and to prevent her from being involved in\nthe affair: \u2018He is protecting himself from others because if he mentions their\nnames his life won\u2019t be worth much.\u2019 Joubert portrayed Richardson as a poorly\neducated and somewhat retarded man who had been easily exploited by the likes\nof Mrs Mandela.\nThe question of whether or not Winnie had been present during the beatings at\nher house was obviously crucial. Eighteen months after the event, having\npreviously made no mention of it to anyone, she now chose to claim that she had\nbeen on a visit to Brandfort at the time. Both the defence and the prosecution in\nthe Richardson murder trial asked the court to make a finding on the matter.\nOn  May , in the Rand Supreme Court, Justice O\u2019Donovan found\nRichardson guilty of the murder of Stompie and guilty on other counts of\nkidnapping, assault and attempted murder. He was subequently sentenced to\ndeath. The judge also ruled on the question of Winnie\u2019s involvement: \u2018The court\nfinding on this issue is that Mrs Mandela was present on  December for at\nleast part of the time.\u2019\nWinnie was also implicated in other trials involving members of Mandela\nUnited Football Club. In August , Charles Zwane was brought to trial,\ncharged with nine counts of murder, eight counts of attempted murder, one count\nof arson and the unlawful possession of firearms. One of the crimes with which\nZwane was charged was a firebomb attack in February  on the home of\nDudu Chili, a well-respected community leader and friend of Albertina Sisulu,\nwith whom Winnie had been engaged in a long-running feud over the activities\n\n\fof Mandela United. Chili\u2019s thirteen-year-old niece had died in the attack.\nZwane\u2019s defence counsel, S. Jacobs, argued, as Richardson\u2019s counsel had\ndone, that Zwane had fallen under the influence of Mrs Mandela. He asked Dudu\nChili to give her assessment of Winnie\u2019s influence.\nJACOBS: Did Winnie Mandela really have the power of life and death\nover these people? If she made a decision to kill, would the people kill?\nCHILI: I believe so.\nJACOBS: Say, for example, she took a decision that Mr X should be\nkilled\u2014a notional person\u2014and she ordered Mr Y to do it, if Mr Y did\nnot carry out his orders, did you think Mr Y would be in danger himself?\nCHILI: I should think so, because they seem to fear her so much.\nZwane was sentenced to death nine times for the murders.\nThe most incriminating piece of evidence against Winnie came during the trial\nof Sibusiso Chili, Dudu Chili\u2019s son. Along with five others, Sibusiso Chili had\nbeen charged with the murder of a member of Mandela United, Maxwell\nMadondo, who himself had been sent on a mission to kill him. Chili was\nconvicted of Madondo\u2019s murder but was sentenced to only one year\u2019s\nimprisonment. The reason for such leniency was a statement agreed upon by the\nprosecution and the defence that was placed on the court record: \u2018The admission\nthe state will make is that the deceased, Maxwell Madondo, was a member of the\nMandela Football Club and that a decision was made by Mrs Winnie Mandela\nand the football club to kill accused number one, Chili, and accused number six,\nIkaneng.\u2019\nOn  September , the attorney-general, Klaus von Lieres, announced\nthat Winnie would be charged with four counts of kidnapping and four charges\nof assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, making her the eighth\naccused in the Stompie murder case.\nNone of these events stopped Winnie seeking positions of political power\nwithin the ANC or Mandela from assisting her at every opportunity. Winnie\nportrayed the government\u2019s decision to prosecute her as part of its political\ncampaign to discredit the Mandelas and the ANC. Mandela took the same view.\nShortly after his release from prison, he was asked in a television interview\nwhether he saw the Richardson trial as another government set-up. \u2018Well, I have\n\n\fno doubt that it is,\u2019 he replied. \u2018The way the South African police have\nconducted themselves in the investigation of the so-called offence has been\ntotally disgraceful. And it is clear that their intention was not to investigate the\ncommission of any crime, but it was partly to destroy the image of the family.\u2019\nRegardless of what evidence was produced against Winnie, Mandela never\nchanged his line of reasoning. He threw his full weight into getting the ANC to\ndeclare publicly its support for her. He seemed besotted by Winnie, immune to\nwiser counsel, determined at whatever cost to foster her ambition and prepared\nto endure in silence her affair with the lawyer Dali Mpofu. Senior ANC officials\nreferred to Winnie as \u2018Nelson\u2019s blind spot\u2019. Despite considerable opposition\nfrom within the ANC, Mandela succeeded in securing her election to the\nJohannesburg regional executive committee, her position as head of the regional\nWomen\u2019s League and her appointment in August  as head of the ANC\u2019s\nsocial affairs department. Her appointment as head of social welfare brought\nletters of complaint from more than  ANC branches around the country.\nAs well as obtaining Mandela\u2019s support, Winnie cultivated her own power\nbase among party militants and youth activists, preaching belligerence, exhorting\nthe masses to fight. This won her support from revolutionary enthusiasts but set\nher at odds with Mandela\u2019s own efforts towards a negotiated settlement. On tour\nwith Mandela in the United States in , she struck a sour note in Harlem with\ntalk of going \u2018back to the bush to fight the white man\u2019. Two days after the ANC\nagreed to suspend armed struggle in August , Winnie described the\nagreement as merely a strategy. She enjoyed dressing up in designer battle\nfatigues to address party rallies and took to wearing a Communist Party pin. She\nprojected herself as a champion of the poor and downtrodden, spending much\ntime visiting squatter camps around Johannesburg and helping the victims of\nviolence. She became renowned for her strong-arm methods of obtaining votes\nin her election campaigns, openly issuing threats to anyone she thought might\nnot support her. Her ambition appeared insatiable.\nWinnie\u2019s trial opened on  February  in Johannesburg\u2019s Rand Supreme\nCourt amid much political fanfare. The ANC\u2019s secretary-general, Alfred Nzo, an\n\u2018old guard\u2019 exile doggedly loyal to the Mandelas, declared the trial to be part of\na \u2018continuing campaign of political harassment\u2019. Members of the regional branch\nof the ANC\u2019s Women\u2019s League, which Winnie chaired, were on hand outside\nthe court to cheer her: \u2018Mother of the Nation, we are with you.\u2019 Winnie had also\norganised a Winnie Mandela Support Ad Hoc Committee composed of friends\n\n\fand admirers. The opening session of the trial was attended by prominent\nactivists like Joe Slovo, Chris Hani and Alfred Nzo, who arrived, at Mandela\u2019s\npersonal request, to show solidarity with Winnie. Her defence team was led by\nthe Mandelas\u2019 old friend George Bizos. It was also notable for including her\nlover, Dali Mpofu.\nFrom the start, the trial was marked by one drama after another. Four of the\neight accused jumped bail and failed to appear. One of the three key state\nwitnesses, Pelo Mekgwe, also went missing. At first it was thought he had been\nabducted, but he subsequently surfaced in Lusaka, saying that he had left South\nAfrica with the help of ANC officials and alleging that he had been bribed by\nWinnie not to testify. Mekgwe\u2019s disappearance so frightened the two remaining\nkey witnesses, Kenny Kgase and Thabiso Mono, that they refused to testify.\nWithout their testimony, the trial would inevitably have collapsed. After a spell\nin the police cells, Kgase and Mono changed their mind. The trial proceeded.\nThe state prosecutor, Jan Swanepoel, began the trial by disclosing that he\nwould introduce two other kidnapping cases in which Winnie had taken part as\nsimilar-fact evidence, thus demonstrating that the Stompie incident was not an\nisolated case. One involved the kidnapping of two people in September  and\ntheir subsequent assault, during which Winnie was present. The other involved\nthe abduction in November  of the Sowetan youth Lolo Sono, whose father\nhad pleaded with Winnie to release him just before he disappeared.\nIn March, Kgase and Mono took the stand, repeating the evidence they had\ngiven during the Richardson trial, testifying how Winnie had led the assault on\nthem and how Stompie had been so badly beaten that he could barely walk.\nDespite relentless cross-examination from Bizos, they remained steadfast in their\nmain version of the events.\nBy the time Winnie took the stand in April, the ANC had decided to distance\nitself from the trial and from Mandela\u2019s adamant defence of Winnie. Winnie was\ntold by senior ANC officials that the trial concerned her and not the ANC. Apart\nfrom Mandela, no senior figures attended court sessions any more.\nWinnie\u2019s defence was to deny everything. She claimed that the Mandela\nUnited Football Club had ceased to exist by the time of the incident. She knew\nnothing about any of the \u2018boys in the back\u2019 living on her premises. Nor had she\nmet any of the four kidnap victims there.\nWinnie claimed that on the evening of  December , hours before Jerry\n\n\fRichardson, Xoliswa Falati and her driver, John Morgan, had gone to fetch the\nfour victims from the Methodist manse, she had left Soweto for Brandfort,\narriving there sometime after ten. She produced two witnesses to corroborate her\nstay. One of them, Thabo Motau, a seventeen-year-old youth who lived opposite\nthe Mandela house in Orlando West, testified that he had driven Winnie to\nBrandfort on  December. The other, Norah Moahloli, a schoolteacher who\nlived in Brandfort, testified that Winnie had stayed with her there. Winnie\nclaimed that she had remained in Brandfort until  December, returning to\nSoweto in the evening. But no witnesses other than Moahloli were produced to\ncorroborate her claim.\nAt least two pieces of evidence directly contradicted Winnie\u2019s version. One\nwas a statement made to the police in February  by John Morgan, who was\none of her co-defendants. Morgan had told police that on  December he had\nseen Winnie slap Stompie, accusing him of having had sex with the Methodist\nminister Paul Verryn. Later that night, he said, he had used Winnie\u2019s vehicle to\ntake Falati and her daughter back to the Methodist manse. The next day he had\ndriven the vehicle back to Winnie\u2019s house, where he washed it. Winnie was at\nhome that day and had told him to drive her to her office in Commerce House.\nZindzi went with her. Faced with this statement in court, Morgan claimed that\npolice had tortured him into making it. But the judge, Michael Stegmann,\ndismissed his assertion as false.\nThe other piece of evidence about Winnie\u2019s whereabouts on  December\nconcerned the visit she made with Katiza Cebekhulu to Dr Asvat\u2019s surgery.\nAccording to Winnie\u2019s version, the visit took place on  December, before she\nleft for Brandfort. According to Asvat\u2019s medical records, Winnie visited him on\n December. But Asvat\u2019s medical records were not produced as evidence\nduring the trial. Nor was his nurse, Albertina Sisulu, asked to testify.\nCebekhulu himself never gave evidence; he was one of the four defendants\nwho disappeared on the eve of the trial. He had previously made a statement to\npolice implicating Winnie in the beating of Stompie and describing Dr Asvat\u2019s\nvisit to Winnie\u2019s house to examine Stompie shortly before he was taken away to\nbe killed. But the statement was not produced in court. Like Pelo Mekgwe,\nCebekhulu subsequently surfaced in Lusaka, under ANC auspices.\nJudge Stegmann\u2019s judgement, given over six hours on  May ,\ncontained a devastating indictment of Winnie\u2019s character. He described her as \u2018a\n\n\fcalm, composed, deliberate and unblushing liar\u2019. He continued, \u2018She gave her\nevidence in a manner which impressed me with her wariness, her unwillingness\nto commit herself to anything clear-cut or definite, and, in short, with a\nremarkable absence of candour. \u2019 She had gone to extraordinary lengths, he said,\nto distance herself from the football team bearing her name: \u2018It is odd to\nencounter a leader who went to as much trouble as Mrs Mandela to distance\nherself from the club which adopted her name and many of whose members\nlived in her own backyard.\u2019\nStegmann was in no doubt that Winnie had masterminded the kidnapping of\nthe four youths. \u2018To imagine that all those took place without Mrs Mandela as\nthe moving spirit is like trying to imagine Hamlet without the prince,\u2019 he said.\nHe remained uncertain, however, about her involvement in the beatings. The\nprosecution had failed to prove that her Brandfort alibis were false, so there\nremained a reasonable possibility that she had gone there before the assaults\nbegan, as she had claimed. Nevertheless, she must have known about the\nkidnappings and beatings subsequently, but she wilfully ignored the victims\u2019\nplight. When pressed by Soweto leaders to release the youths, she refused to free\nthem. By continuing to hold them for twenty days and to give accommodation to\nthose who had committed the assault, she had associated herself with the crime.\nAt the very least, Stegmann concluded, Winnie was an accessory after the fact to\nall that had happened. He found her guilty on four counts of kidnapping and of\nbeing an accessory to the assaults.\nSitting listening to this judgement on his wife, Mandela seemed an old and\ncrumpled figure, drained of all dignity. Loyal to the last, after the verdict had\nbeen given he embraced Winnie, kissing her on the lips, but even though he\nmanaged to control the distress he felt, he was grim-faced and disheartened.\nWinnie herself, though shaken by the remarks Stegmann had made about her,\nquickly recovered her poise. \u2018As long as you know now that I didn\u2019t assault any\nchild,\u2019 she declared to journalists gathered around her in the well of the court,\n\u2018that is all that matters to me.\u2019 She left the court with a clenched-fist salute,\nmaintaining that she had been exonerated.\nThe following day, Stegmann sentenced her to a prison term of five years on\nthe kidnapping charge and an additional one year for her role as an accessory to\nthe assaults. Winnie, he said, bore the brunt of the moral blame for the criminal\nactions of those in her immediate circle:\n\n\fYour position of leadership was not something which entitled you to play fast\nand loose with the liberties of others to serve your own purposes. You\nfundamentally misunderstood or ignored the responsibilities which came with\nyour position as leader. In this case one of the worst features was your complete\nabsence of compassion towards the victims of the assaults, suffering in your own\nbackyard, just outside your window.\nStegmann sentenced her co-defendant, Xoliswa Falati, to six years\u2019\nimprisonment, and John Morgan, the driver, to one year\u2019s imprisonment\nsuspended for five years. George Bizos immediately announced his intention of\nappealing against Stegmann\u2019s verdict and applied for bail.\nMandela was not present in court to hear sentence passed on Winnie, but he\ncontinued to protest her innocence. \u2018My faith in her has been fully vindicated,\u2019\nhe said, after learning of the sentence. \u2018I also believe that she did not know there\nwas anyone at the back of the house against his will.\u2019 The last word in the matter\nhad not yet been spoken, he said: \u2018We trust that soon her name will be cleared\ncompletely.\u2019\n\nShortly after Mandela\u2019s release from prison, photographers taking pictures of\nMandela and Winnie at their home in Soweto asked the couple to move closer to\none another. Winnie shyly demurred, whereupon Mandela moved his chair\ncloser, put an arm around Winnie and said, \u2018I am the only man in the world who\ncan control this woman.\u2019\nThe reality, however, was different. Mandela himself was a victim of\nWinnie\u2019s own manipulation. For twenty-seven years in prison, Winnie had been\none of his greatest sources of strength. The sense of guilt he felt for her own\nplight during those years, he once told her in a letter, ravaged every part of his\nbeing. He emerged from prison obdurately loyal to her. It made no difference\nthat she had become a criminal menace or that she was unfaithful to him.\nMandela\u2019s loyalty was beyond reason and Winnie exploited this fact to the full.\nIn a plea of mitigation against the sentence Winnie was to be given, George\nBizos pointed out to Stegmann that by kidnapping standards her crime had been\nrelatively minor. Indeed, at a time when murders and massacres in South Africa\nwere commonplace, whether carried out by the police, the third force, Inkatha or\nthe ANC, the crimes of which Winnie had been convicted were in themselves of\n\n\flittle consequence.\nYet behind the trial lay a larger reality. Winnie had been the head of a\ncriminal gang which had been involved in murder, rape, arson and assault. Her\nactivities had contaminated the reputations of the ANC and of Mandela, upon\nwhom the future of South Africa was seen largely to depend. Mandela\ncompounded the problem by wilfully refusing to come to terms with what had\nhappened. Even after her conviction, he continued to support Winnie\u2019s drive for\npower and office. Time and again she was to become embroiled in scandal,\ncausing one embarrassment after another; and time and again, she was to survive\nthe consequences. But the burden of all this was to be carried by Mandela,\nmaking the monumental tasks he already faced that much harder.\n \fCHAPTER \n\nPASSING THE BATON\nFROM AN EARLY STAGE IN HIS PRESIDENCY, MANDELA BEGAN TO\nprepare South Africa for the post-Mandela era. \u2018At the end of my term, I\u2019ll be\neighty-one\u2019, he said. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise that a robust country like South\nAfrica should be led by an octogenarian. You need younger men who can shake\nand move this country\u2019.\nWhatever the faults and failures of his administration, so much confidence, so\nmuch trust, had come to be placed in Mandela that there was deep apprehension\nabout the prospect of his departure from government. He was seen as not only\nthe founding father of democracy but also the guarantor of its stability. Rumours\nof his ill-health were enough to send the stock exchange and the currency into a\ntailspin. For a man in his late seventies, he suffered from relatively few ailments\n\u2014an eye affliction, a slight loss of hearing, swollen ankles. His schedule\nremained as punishing as ever\u2014early starts, late nights, meetings, speeches,\ntravel abroad. But any sign of exhaustion or fatigue was greeted with alarm. In\nan attempt to quell speculation about his health, Mandela submitted himself to a\nthree-day \u2018executive check-up\u2019 in March  and passed without difficulty. \u2018He\nhas the energy of a man half his age\u2019, a specialist consultant remarked. In a letter\nto a Johannesburg newspaper, Mandela wrote: \u2018Let me restate the obvious: I\nhave long passed my teens; and the distance to my final destination is shorter\nthan the road I have trudged over the years. What nature has decreed should not\ngenerate undue insecurity\u2019. But public concern about a future without him\nremained high.\nWhile expressing confidence that he would serve his five-year term as\npresident in full, Mandela stressed that he had no intention of staying in office\nfor a second term after , regardless of popular demand. He minimised his\nown importance in government, emphasising the talent and ability of his cabinet\ncolleagues. \u2018Many of my colleagues are head and shoulders above me in almost\nevery respect. Rather than being an asset, I\u2019m more of a decoration\u2019.\n\n\fMandela left much of the government\u2019s routine business in the hands of his\nkey aide, Thabo Mbeki, who served as deputy president beginning in .\nMbeki had been nurtured in the crucible of nationalist politics from an early age.\nHis father, Govan Mbeki, a hardline communist and ANC stalwart, had\ndedicated his life to political struggle and expected Thabo, his eldest son, to\nfollow suit. A studi - ous, introverted boy who spent much of his spare time\nreading his father\u2019s books at the family home in rural Transkei, he joined the\nANC Youth League at the age of fourteen, launched a pro-ANC student\norganisation at the age of nineteen, then joined the Communist Party a year later.\nIn , at the age of twenty, he was sent abroad by the ANC, along with\ntwenty-six other students, to further his studies, and he did not return until .\nIn his years in exile, he earned a degree in economics from the University of\nSussex in England, underwent military training in the Soviet Union, became a\nmember of the Communist Party\u2019s politburo and represented the ANC in a series\nof foreign postings.\nDuring the s, when Western leaders such as Britain\u2019s Margaret Thatcher\nregarded the ANC as \u2018a typical terrorist organisation\u2019, Mbeki came to be seen in\nthe West as its acceptable face\u2014a soft-spoken, articulate pragmatist who\nfavoured a negotiated settlement to end apartheid rather than revolutionary\nviolence. He was particularly skilful in handling contacts with the stream of\nwhite South Africans\u2014businessmen, academics, churchmen and opposition\npoliticians\u2014who travelled from South Africa to talk to the ANC, in defiance of\nthe government, seeking a way through the impasse. Dressed in a tweed jacket\nand puffing his ubiquitous pipe, Mbeki spoke more the language of the middle\nclass than the rhetoric expected of revolutionaries. Once back in South Africa, he\nperformed much the same task, pacifying businessmen alarmed by talk of\nnationalisation, right-wing Afrikaners demanding a separate volkstaat and Zulu\nnationalists threatening civil war. \u2018He can be diplomatic to the point where many\npeople regard him as weak\u2019, Mandela once observed.\nWhile Mandela presided over South Africa as a benign patriarch, floating\nabove the political hurly-burly and taking a broad-brush approach to\ngovernment, Mbeki immersed himself in detail. Ambitious to succeed Mandela,\nhe possessed no natural constituency within the ANC and lacked the common\ntouch, but relied heavily on his skills as a backroom operator to build political\nsupport, making alliances with all and sundry. He was as adept at aligning\nhimself with populist factions when the occasion arose as with the pragmatic\n\n\fwing of the party. Whereas Mandela placed the need for reconciliation above all\nelse, Mbeki put greater emphasis on the need to transform South African society.\n\u2018You cannot find reconciliation between blacks and whites in a situation in\nwhich poverty and prosperity continue to be defined in racial terms\u2019, he said. \u2018If\nyou want reconciliation between black and white, you need to transform society.\nIf we have an economy that is geared to benefit the whites and disadvantage the\nblack majority, and you do not address that, you will not have reconciliation\u2019.\nHe was given particular responsibility for fashioning economic policy, a\nsubject about which Mandela admitted to knowing little. To widespread dismay,\nMbeki guarded the process closely, relying on no more than a small inner circle\nto assist him. Mandela only saw a draft of the plan shortly before its publication.\nThe outcome was a policy document called Growth, Employment and\nRedistribution that endorsed an orthodox free-market strategy. Published in\n, it advocated strict fiscal discipline, lower government deficits,\nprivatisation, trade liberalisation and export-driven growth. It won Mbeki the\napproval of foreign investors and the business community but infuriated the\nANC\u2019s traditional allies\u2014the trade unions and the Communist Party. He was\naccused of betraying the revolution, of selling out to international capital, of\nforsaking \u2018the soul of the ANC\u2019. Mandela nevertheless pronounced himself\nsatisfied and rebuked critics at a Communist Party conference. \u2018I will ensure that\nthe government implements what we believe to be good for the country\u2019, he told\nthem, wagging his finger.\nMbeki\u2019s record as Mandela\u2019s chief executive, however, was none too\nimpressive. He acquired a reputation for announcing grand plans\u2014for\nprivatisation of parastatal corporations, for example\u2014but dithering over their\nimplementation. He was responsible for mishandling a number of assignments\nthat Mandela gave to him\u2014including the mess over Winnie Mandela\u2019s\nresignation, the Boesak scandal, Buthelezi\u2019s demand for international mediation\nand foreign policy initiatives, including a bungled attempt to prevent Nigeria\u2019s\nmilitary rulers from executing a prominent dissident, Ken Saro Wiwa. He also\ndisplayed abysmal judgement when handling the TRC report.\nHis critics pointed to other faults. Some bemoaned his penchant for turning up\nlate for appointments or missing them altogether, for enjoying the good life and\nfor hobnobbing with populists. Others warned of more sinister traits. He was\nportrayed as an arch-manipulator, preferring to operate in secret behind the\nscenes, trusting only a small cabal of loyal advisers and acting ruthlessly in\n\n\fstifling dissent and in disposing of rivals. The press noted how hostile, even\nparanoid, he was about criticism and cited his tendency to react to criticism with\naccusations of racial malice.\nMandela, too, had misgivings about Mbeki. His personal choice as his\nsuccessor had been Cyril Ramaphosa, the trade union leader who had played a\ncrucial role in negotiating the white handover of power. But the party\u2019s vote\nwent to Mbeki.\nThe succession was effectively sealed at the ANC\u2019s national conference in\nMafikeng in December . Having outmanoeuvred other contenders, Mbeki\nwas elected ANC president unopposed. But the occasion was not the complete\ntriumph that Mbeki wanted. For Mandela saw the need to issue words of caution,\nhis remarks prompting applause:\nThere is a heavy responsibility for a leader elected unopposed. He may use that\npowerful position to settle scores with his detractors, to marginalise or get rid of\nthem [applause] and surround themselves with yes-men and women [applause].\nHis first duty is to allay the concerns of his colleagues to enable them to discuss\nfreely without fear within the internal structures of the movement. Any subject\nshould be discussed from all angles and people should even be able to criticise\nthe leader without fear or favour.\nMandela\u2019s farewell speech as ANC president was otherwise notable for its\nnegative tone. It was mainly the handiwork of Mbeki and seemed intended to set\nout a new, more aggressive agenda, but Mandela nevertheless dutifully read it\nout. He spoke of a \u2018counter-revolutionary network\u2019, run largely by Afrikaners,\nthat was deliberately trying to erode confidence in South Africa, subvert the\neconomy and use crime to make the country ungovernable. He berated white\nbusinessmen for the slow pace of \u2018transformation\u2019 and black empowerment. He\naccused the media of perpetuating \u2018the legacy of racism\u2019, ignoring black opinion\nand conducting a propaganda campaign to discredit the ANC. He claimed nongovernment organisations had set themselves up as independent watchdogs at\nthe behest of foreign agents. The litany continued for four hours.\nNone of this accorded with the rainbow-nation optimism for which Mandela\nwas renowned. It reflected more of Mbeki\u2019s mind-set and the conspiracies he\nbelieved were ranged against him than Mandela\u2019s view of the world. It\nsquandered much goodwill and signaled the coming of a more fractious era.\n\n\fThe balance sheet of Mandela\u2019s years in office was mixed. Major strides were\nmade in the provision of housing, sanitation, piped water and electricity. But\nhowever much Mandela tried to focus attention on the poorer sections of society,\nthe immediate beneficiary of the new South Africa was the black middle class.\nIn the civil service and parastatal corporations, blacks rapidly gained positions of\nstatus and responsibility from which they had been barred for so long, helped by\na policy of affirmative action that accorded preferential treatment to \u2018previously\ndisadvantaged\u2019 groups. The business sector followed suit, anxious to be seen to\nbe redressing the legacy of inequality. Only  per cent of managerial posts were\nheld by blacks, despite years of talk about the need for black advancement. The\nopportunities for those with skills and qualifications were vast. Yet the reservoir\nof trained and experienced blacks was all too small. Out of a total of ,\nchartered accountants, for example, only  were black.\nBut even though the way was now open for rapid promotion, the new elite still\nclamored for a faster overhaul of the old, white institutions. They pointed to how\nthe National Party, after its  election victory, had ensured the mass\nrecruitment of Afrikaners across the board, transforming a whole range of\ninstitutions from broadcasting to the army and the railways into Afrikaner\npreserves, and demanded that the ANC take similar action. Some wanted to\nestablish an African version of the Afrikaner Broederbond to promote black\ninterests.\nAs well as affirmative action, the government pursued a programme of \u2018black\neconomic empowerment\u2019 that encouraged white-owned corporations to sell off\nstakes to black entrepreneurs. Thabo Mbeki was a fervent advocate of the plan.\n\u2018We must strive to create and strengthen a black capitalist class\u2019, he told a\nconference of black businessmen. Blacks had no need to be embarrassed about\nthe emergence of a successful and prosperous black bourgeoisie, he said. It was\npart of the process of the \u2018deracialisation\u2019 of the economy and society. The\nbenefits would spread to the poor.\nBut, again, the pool of black businessmen was so tiny that in one business deal\nafter another, a small group of well-connected entrepreneurs made all the\nrunning, enriching themselves hugely in the process. One prominent black\nbusinessman made an estimated profit of  million rands during an eight-month\nperiod merely by acquiring equity as an empowerment partner and then selling it\n\n\fto a non-empowerment party. Within a few years, a new class of multimillionaires had emerged. Leading ANC members were quick to seize the same\nopportunities, trading political contacts for shareholdings. \u2018I did not struggle\n[only] to remain poor\u2019, declared one prominent ANC official. \u2018Crony capitalism\u2019\nbegan to take root.\nWhat the Mandela years witnessed, in fact, was a significant widening of the\nincome gap within the black community. The gap had been growing since the\nlate s. During the s, while the poorest half of the population slid ever\ndeeper into poverty, the black middle class fared well, with rising incomes\nmaking its members the most upwardly mobile group in the country. During the\ns, the black elite\u2014politicians, bureaucrats, entrepreneurs, managers,\nbusinessmen\u2014prospered as never before, many acquiring the lifestyle and status\nsymbols so prized in South Africa: executive cars, swimming pools, domestic\nstaff, private school education, golf handicaps and foreign holidays. Perhaps \nper cent of the black community reached middle-class status. But for the\nmajority, the same struggle against poverty continued.\nThe growing spectre of corruption added to the sense of a new ruling class\nbent above all on self-enrichment, as Mandela ruefully acknowledged at the end\nof his five-year term. \u2018We came to government with the zeal of a group of\npeople who were going to eliminate corruption in government\u2019, he said in .\n\u2018It was such a sad disappointment to note that our own people who are there to\nwipe out corruption themselves become corrupt\u2019.\nThere were other setbacks. Instead of a falling unemployment rate,\nemployment levels in the mining, agricultural and manufacturing sectors all fell;\noverall, unemployment figures hovered between  and  per cent. A fearsome\ncrime wave blighted communities across the country. But by far the greatest\ncalamity was the advancing menace of the Aids pandemic and the government\u2019s\nfailure to deal with it.\n\nLike other African states, South Africa reacted lethargically to the onset of the\nAids crisis. The first significant batch of HIV-positive cases was reported among\nmigrant mineworkers from Malawi employed on Rand gold mines in . By\n, the adult HIV infection rate, measured in an ante-natal survey, stood at .\nper cent; by , it had trebled to . per cent. But when the apartheid\ngovernment eventually stirred into action, launching Aids education and\n\n\fprevention programmes, it met considerable resistance. Anti-apartheid activists\nclaimed the programmes were a government plot to control population growth\nby convincing black people to have less sex and produce fewer babies and\nthereby check the advance of African liberation; they lampooned the Aids\nacronym by saying it stood for \u2018Afrikaner Invention to Deprive Us of Sex\u2019.\nOthers interpreted the epidemic as the product of malevolent individuals\nemploying witchcraft.\nMandela\u2019s government purported to give the Aids campaign a high priority,\nbut with so many other causes demanding attention\u2014housing, education, jobs\nand wider health problems\u2014it achieved little. Though designating the campaign\na \u2018Presidential Lead Project\u2019, Mandela found the topic uncomfortable and failed\nto throw his weight behind it. He passed responsibility for Aids to Thabo Mbeki,\nwho was given an inter-ministerial committee to chair. A national Aids plan was\ndevised, but it was soon mired in controversy. A large part of the Aids budget\nwas spent on an expensive musical show, Sarafina II, that was supposed to take\nAids education to the masses but was derided by Aids activists as being a waste\nof money and eventually scrapped in midstream after a corruption scandal.\nMandela\u2019s health minister, Nkosasana Dlamini-Zuma, a medical doctor, was\naccused by investigators of being \u2018reckless\u2019 and \u2018negligent\u2019.\nThe next controversy exposed the government to further ridicule. In , two\nPretoria researchers claimed to have invented a cheap drug that could cure Aids.\nThe drawback they faced was that the Medicines Control Council (MCC)\ncondemned their product\u2014Virodene\u2014as ineffective and dangerous and refused\nto issue them a licence to manufacture it. Their cause was nevertheless taken up\nby Mbeki and Dlamini-Zuma. In , the researchers were invited to address\nthe cabinet, where they spoke movingly about the miracle properties of\nVirodene, paraded eleven patients who were said to have benefited from the\ndrug and asked for substantial funds to develop it. They claimed that the MCC\nhad rejected Virodene because the council was acting in collusion with\ninternational pharmaceutical companies which stood to lose huge profits from\ntheir own products once Virodene went on sale. A rank amateur in medical\nmatters, Mbeki swallowed their argument and authorised Dlamini-Zuma to\narrange fast-track approval for production, riding roughshod over vociferous\nobjections from the MCC.\nThe MCC\u2019s chairman was later fired, and the council was stripped of much of\nits authority. But an independent review panel led by the South African Medical\n\n\fResearch Council found that, in fact, Virodene was highly toxic: its main\ningredient, dimethylformamide, was an industrial solvent known to cause severe\nliver damage. The public reaction was scathing. The Sunday Times jeered that\nthe cabinet\u2019s \u2018combined technical knowledge of the HIV virus would fit on the\nback of a postcard\u2019.\nDespite the opprobrium, Mbeki and Dlamini-Zuma plunged headlong into\nfurther controversy. In , a new antiretroviral drug, azidothymidine (AZT),\nraised hopes of significant progress against Aids; tests showed that it could cut\nvertical transmission from infected mothers to babies by  per cent. But\nDlamini-Zuma announced\u2014at a time when the government was preparing to\nspend vast sums on unwanted armaments\u2014that AZT would not be made\navailable on the grounds that it was too expensive. When AZT\u2019s manufacturers\noffered to cut the drug\u2019s price by two-thirds, Dlamini-Zuma switched to arguing\nthat AZT was toxic.\nMandela belatedly realised that he had failed to come to grips with the Aids\ncrisis. By , official estimates of the number of HIV-POSITIVE cases stood\nat  million people\u2014 per cent of the population. The number who had already\ndied of Aids was put at ,. Shortly before stepping down, Mandela\nformally apologised to Aids activists for neglecting the issue. In retirement, he\nwas to make the fight against Aids a personal priority. But by then, South Africa\nwas in the hands of a president descending ever deeper into the realms of\npseudo-science and conspiracy theories.\n\nIn a letter from prison to his friend Amina Cachalia, Mandela once wrote, \u2018I\nhave spent all my life dreaming of a golden age in which all problems will be\nsolved and our wildest hopes fulfilled\u2019. The golden age of which Mandela\ndreamed remained a distant prospect. Nevertheless, the transformation of South\nAfrica from a country riven by racial division and violence to a fledgling\ndemocracy represented one of the supreme triumphs of the late twentieth\ncentury.\nMandela\u2019s role in that transformation was vital to its success. He understood\nfrom an early stage the extent to which white fear lay at the core of the conflict.\nNo matter what personal hardships he had to endure, he never lost sight of the\ngoal of non-racial democracy in South Africa, believing that white fear of it\ncould eventually be overcome. The generosity of spirit he showed after his\n\n\fprison ordeal had a profound impact on his white adversaries, earning him\nmeasures of trust and confidence which made a political settlement attainable.\nAs president, he pursued the cause of national reconciliation with the same\ntenacity, using his years in office to foster a climate of tolerance in the hope that\nit might take root permanently, but knowing of the difficult times that lay ahead.\nSouth Africa, as he departed, faced many hazards. Its crime rate was among\nthe highest in the world, unemployment and poverty were widespread and racial\ntensions were never far below the surface. But the foundations for a new society\nwhich Mandela helped to lay at least enabled South Africa to face the future with\nmore hope than once seemed possible.\nMany expectations, however, were soon to turn sour. \fCHAPTER \n\nCODESA\nBY MID-, EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER DE KLERK\u2019S BOLD\nREFORMS, South Africa was mired in crisis. The country was afflicted by\nappalling bouts of violence from which there seemed no escape. In Natal, a\nsmall-scale civil war was under way. The government\u2019s reputation, as a result of\nInkathagate, had been seriously damaged. Distrust was manifest on all sides.\nLittle progress had been made towards even starting negotiations. To make\nmatters worse, economic recession was exacting a heavy toll.\nThe ANC had considerable trouble putting its own house in order. It found the\nbusiness of converting itself from an underground liberation movement into a\nproperly constituted political organisation\u2014establishing party offices, recruiting\nmembers, raising funds, organising the return of thousands of exiles and\nensuring the welfare of returning guerrillas\u2014an immensely difficult process,\nalmost beyond its means. The result, more often than not, was chaos.\nInternal disputes overshadowed all else. So great was the furore over the\nANC\u2019s decision to suspend the armed struggle that the national executive\ncommittee decided to postpone the holding of the ANC\u2019s first national\nconference inside South Africa for thirty years until July . At a substitute\n\u2018consultative conference\u2019 in December , Mandela was the target of\nsustained criticism over his autocratic style, his failure to consult more\nfrequently about policy issues and his cordial relationship with de Klerk. When\nhe and Tambo put forward a proposal advocating the phased lifting of sanctions\nagainst South Africa, ANC militants countered with their own resolution\ninsisting that sanctions should be maintained unchanged and received\noverwhelming support from cheering delegates. In his concluding remarks,\nMandela noted ruefully, \u2018One of the most disappointing features of the\nconference was that there was hardly a word of praise.\u2019 He acknowledged that he\nand the national executive committee had been wrong not to keep the party\nmembership informed about their contacts and agreements with the government.\nHe said he accepted the criticism \u2018without qualification\u2019 and promised to make\n\n\f\u2018radical adjustments\u2019 to the ANC\u2019s leadership. But he also defended his right to\ncontinue with what he called \u2018confidential\u2019 discussions with the government. It\nwas simply not practical, he said, to refer every problem back to a party\nconference.\nNot just Mandela but Winnie too was the target of attack from critics within\nthe ANC intent on curbing her ruthless ambition. In April , Winnie made a\ndetermined bid, with Mandela\u2019s support, to be elected president of the ANC\u2019s\nWomen\u2019s League. Two other candidates stood for election, Gertrude Shope, an\nexiled leader who had been head of the ANC\u2019s women\u2019s division in Lusaka, and\nAlbertina Sisulu. In order to ensure that Winnie was not elected, Albertina\nwithdrew from the election and publicly called on her supporters to cast their\nvotes for Shope. The result was a crushing defeat for Winnie, who gained less\nthan a third of the vote.\nAt the ANC\u2019s national conference in July , at the age of seventy-two,\nMandela was elected president, in place of his ailing friend Oliver Tambo. But\nmany of the same criticisms of his leadership were voiced once more. One\nformer UDF leader, Mosiuoa Lekota, openly denounced Mandela for his\ntendency to try to impose his will on internal decision-making, and received a\nhuge cheer for doing so. There was strong criticism too of the disorganised state\nof the ANC, attributed by many delegates to the incompetence of the \u2018old guard\u2019\non the national executive committee. A confidential internal report presented to\nthe conference noted: \u2018We lack enterprise, creativity and initiative. We appear\nvery happy to remain pigeon-holed within the confines of populist rhetoric and\nclich\u00e9s.\u2019 Attendance at recent rallies had been low, those rallies had been poorly\norganised, membership recruitment had fallen far below expectations and, the\nreport concluded, \u2018Clearly we have not utilized our full potential to mobilize\nmillions of our people into effective action.\u2019\nIn the election for party posts, half of the old guard were swept away and\nreplaced by former UDF leaders whom Mandela and Winnie had previously\ncontrived to exclude from influence. Despite Mandela\u2019s strenuous efforts, the\nkey post of secretary-general went to Cyril Ramaphosa, whose election brought\nrapturous applause from delegates. Ramaphosa represented the new generation\nof political activists. As a student, he had served two prison sentences for\npolitical activity. A lawyer by training, he had thrown himself into trade union\nactivity, building up membership of the mineworkers\u2019 union from , to\n, and helping to launch the trade union federation, Cosatu. His abilities as\n\n\fa successful organiser and as a skilful negotiator were held in high regard by\nmining company executives, with whom he was often in conflict. He was\nfamiliar with the democratic approach of the UDF and held no particular\nreverence for old-guard politicians from the Mandela generation who considered\nlength of service the principal qualification for party office. In the months\npreceding Mandela\u2019s release from prison, when speculation about it was rife, he\nremarked in a magazine interview that Mandela should not expect just to walk\nout of prison and take over the ANC. His standing, he said, was \u2018no different\nfrom the status of any other member of the ANC\u2019; he was just \u2018one of those\npeople who may have to be considered for a leadership position\u2019. Ramaphosa\nwas also one of the few individuals in the ANC hierarchy prepared to stand up to\nthe malevolence of Winnie Mandela. As one of the authors of the original report\nexposing her crimes, he was fully aware not only of her guilt but also of the\ndamage that would be done to the ANC if she was allowed to continue her\nrelentless drive for power. Aged only thirty-eight when he was elected secretarygeneral, Ramaphosa quickly made his mark both on the ANC and on the whole\nnegotiation process.\nDespite these curbs to his personal authority, Mandela was successful in\ngaining support for his efforts in steering the ANC back towards talks with the\ngovernment, suspended since May, even though none of the demands it had\nmade at the time had been met. Mandela argued that for the ANC to continue\npostponing talks because of political violence effectively gave a veto to\nrightwing factions around de Klerk which did not want negotiations to proceed.\nThey should be seen as \u2018a victory for the ANC\u2019 and \u2018a defeat\u2019 for the\ngovernment, not the reverse. Negotiations, he said, were \u2018a theatre of struggle\u2019.\nAny further delay would play into the hands of the enemy: \u2018It can never be in\nour interest that we prolong the agony of the apartheid system. It does not serve\nthe interests of the masses we represent and the country as a whole that we delay\n. . . the achievement of the objective of the transfer of power to the people.\u2019\nMandela also put forward for the first time the idea of a \u2018transitional government\nof national unity\u2019 in which power would be shared with de Klerk\u2019s despised\nNational Party.\nAlthough Mandela regained the initiative for negotiations, revolutionary\nenthusiasts were hard at work, preaching the virtues of mass action. Their day\nwas yet to come.\nThe first attempt at negotiation between the three main rivals\u2014Mandela, de\n\n\fKlerk and Buthelezi\u2014was largely a disaster. In September , they were\nbrought together for the first time to attend a national peace conference at the\nCarlton Hotel in Johannesburg organised by a group of business, church and\ncivic leaders. The atmosphere at the conference was extremely tense. One week\nbefore, gunmen, assumed to be Umkhonto members, had ambushed an Inkatha\nmarch in Thokoza, a township near Johannesburg, killing twenty-three people\nand injuring eighteen others. Inkatha gunmen retaliated with an indiscriminate\nattack on buses, taxis and trains.\nWhile delegates to the conference were discussing \u2018codes of conduct\u2019 inside\nthe hotel, on the street outside hundreds of Inkatha supporters, armed with\ntraditional weapons, paraded up and down in front of the hotel in a show of\nsupport for Buthelezi. By the time he got round to telling the demonstrators to go\nhome, little sense of accord remained. At a subsequent press conference, when\nde Klerk sought to play down the incident, saying that the Inkatha demonstrators\nhad committed \u2018no crime\u2019 and had \u2018apparently enjoyed themselves\u2019, Mandela\nreacted in fury, jumping up from his seat to grab the microphone and asserting\nthat if the demonstrators had belonged to the ANC the police would have used\nforce to disperse them. The press conference, intended to mark agreement on a\npeace accord, degenerated into an ugly public wrangle. Buthelezi demonstrated\nhis disdain for the process by refusing to participate in a three-way handshake\nwith Mandela and de Klerk, suggested by press photographers. When the\nphotographers persisted, Buthelezi, keeping his hands tightly gripped on his\nceremonial fly whisk, snapped that he was not going to \u2018perform like a clown\u2019\nfor them. In October, South Africa experienced one of its worst months of\nviolence on record.\nMerely finding a starting point for negotiations proved highly contentious.\nMandela and de Klerk held several meetings during September and October but\nfound little common ground on how a new constitution should be formulated.\nMandela insisted that the constitution should be drawn up by an elected\nassembly, so that each party\u2019s influence on the final document would be\nproportionate to its national support. De Klerk wanted an unelected conference,\ncomprising all political parties \u2018with a proven basis of support\u2019, to deliberate\nupon two crucial issues: the composition, functioning and decision-making\nprocess of the actual constitutional negotiating conference, and the broad\nprinciples to be contained in a new constitution. He opposed the idea of a\nconstituent assembly, fearing that it would allow a single party or alliance of\n\n\fparties emerging from an election with a commanding majority virtually to write\nits own constitution\u2014in effect predetermining constitutional issues which were\nsupposed to be the subject of negotiation. Mandela demanded an interim\ngovernment; de Klerk said he had no intention of handing over power before the\nnew constitution was in place.\nThe two men were also locked in a long-standing dispute over the status of\nUmkhonto we Sizwe. De Klerk demanded that the ANC should disband its\nguerrilla army and put its arms caches under joint control. He maintained it was\na \u2018private army\u2019 no longer permissible under the terms of the national peace\naccord signed in September . Mandela refused, telling de Klerk that for the\nANC to demobilise its armed wing when it was subject to armed attack would be\ntantamount to suicide.\nAll that was finally agreed was to hold a multiparty conference, to be known\nas the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, or Co - desa, as it was\npopularly called, together with a date, an agenda and a venue. It had taken nearly\ntwo years to get that far.\n\nOn  December , in a cavernous and gloomy trade exhibition hall near\nJohannesburg\u2019s international airport, there assembled the widest cross-section of\npolitical groups that had ever met in South Africa. The only similar gathering\nthat had ever taken place was a national convention in -, when\nrepresentatives from the Transvaal, the Orange Free State, the Cape and Natal\nagreed to establish the Union of South Africa. On that occasion no Africans were\npresent.\nInvitations to Codesa had been sent to twenty-three parties, nineteen of which\nhad accepted. In addition to delegations from the government, the National Party\nand the ANC, there were representatives from the Inkatha Freedom Party; the\nCommunist Party; the Transvaal and Natal Indian Congresses; four\n\u2018independent\u2019 homeland governments; four \u2018self-governing\u2019 homeland parties;\nthree parties from the Indian and Coloured parliaments; and the liberal\nparliamentary opposition party, the Democratic Party. Those who refused\ninvitations included the far-right Conservative Party; the extremist Afrikaner\nWeerstandsbeweging; and the Pan-Africanist Congress. Four days beforehand,\nthe PAC had held a special conference in Cape Town which had decided to\nboycott negotiations altogether, with delegates shouting, \u2018One settler, one bullet.\n\n\f\u2018\nOne other notable absentee was Buthelezi. Although Inkatha was present,\nButhelezi had decided to stay away in protest that his demand for two additional\ndelegations, one headed by the king of the Zulus, Goodwill Zwelethini, the other\nrepresenting the KwaZulu administration, had been turned down. Five days\nbefore Codesa opened, addressing supporters outside Durban, he had warned\nthat Zulus should not be left aggrieved \u2018lest what happens in this country\nemerges as so terrible and so destructive that the civil wars [in Angola and\nMozambique] are child\u2019s play by comparison\u2019. Thereafter Buthelezi\u2019s\ncontribution to the negotiations process was to consist largely of a similar\nmixture of threats and bluster.\nCodesa\u2019s first plenary session, known as Codesa , was intended to be largely\na formality. Before handing over to a series of working groups, delegations were\nasked to sign a Declaration of Intent, consisting mainly of expressions of\ngoodwill, which committed them to an undivided South Africa, a multiparty\ndemocracy with universal suffrage, a separation of powers, an independent\njudiciary and a bill of rights. Inkatha immediately adopted a dissident role,\nrefusing to sign on the grounds that the reference contained to an \u2018undivided\u2019\nSouth Africa implied that the federal system it wanted had been ruled out. Only\nwhen an amendment was later inserted, giving an assurance that the offending\nclause did not preclude a federal system, did Inkatha sign.\nOne speaker after another stepped up to the podium to express goodwill. The\nNational Party\u2019s contribution was memorable for the way in which its chief\ndelegate, Dawie de Villiers, endeavoured to offer an apology for apartheid. His\nparty, he said, had hoped that \u2018a policy of separation\u2019 would bring peace to the\ncountry, but apartheid had produced instead conflict, injustice and misery: \u2018In so\nfar as that occurred, we deeply regret it.\u2019\nThe last two delegates due to speak were Mandela and de Klerk. What\noccurred, broadcast live on radio and television, sent a shockwave across the\ncountry. Mandela had originally been scheduled to speak last, but the previous\nevening de Klerk had asked him on the phone if he could speak last instead.\nSeveral of Mandela\u2019s colleagues had misgivings, but Mandela saw no reason not\nto accord de Klerk the favour.\nMandela, in his address, duly spoke of the importance of the occasion, as\nother delegates had done. Then de Klerk went to the podium for the final speech\n\n\fof the day. He too began by citing the historic significance of the gathering. He\nspoke of the need to overcome mutual distrust and suspicion, and of his support\nfor the idea of \u2018power-sharing\u2019.\nBut then he turned his speech into an attack on the ANC. The ANC, he said,\nhad failed to honour an agreement to dismantle Umkhonto, and he went on to\nquestion whether the ANC\u2019s commitment to agreements reached at the\nconvention would be worth the paper they were written on if it did not abandon\nthe armed struggle. His clear intention was to belittle Mandela and to\ndemonstrate to his own followers his toughness in handling the ANC. He spoke\nin the manner of a headmaster dealing with an errant child.\nMandela was infuriated, not just by de Klerk\u2019s accusations but by his\ndeception in trying to get in the last word. Once again, he had trusted de Klerk\nagainst the advice of his own colleagues, only to be proved wrong. Seething with\nanger, he insisted on the right of reply and strode to the podium to denigrate de\nKlerk in full public view, his voice manifesting all the contempt and loathing he\nfelt for the man:\nI am gravely concerned about the behaviour of Mr de Klerk today. He has\nlaunched an attack on the ANC and in doing so he has been less than frank. Even\nthe head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime, as his is, has certain\nmoral standards to uphold. He has no excuse just because he is the head of such\na discredited regime not to uphold moral standards. . .\nIf a man can come to a conference of this nature and play the type of politics\nhe has played\u2014very few people would like to deal with such a man. . .\nThe members of the government persuaded us to allow them to speak last.\nThey were very keen to say the last word here. It is now clear why they did so.\nHe has abused his position, because he hoped that I would not respond. He was\ncompletely mistaken. I respond now.\nThe ANC, he said, had shown its commitment to peace by suspending the\narmed struggle. As de Klerk well knew, it had agreed to turn in its weapons only\nwhen it was part of a government collecting those weapons: \u2018What political\norganisation would hand over its weapons to the same man who is regarded by\nthe people as killing innocent people?\u2019 He had warned de Klerk on countless\noccasions that it served no useful purpose to attack the ANC publicly, yet \u2018he\ncontinues to do exactly that and we\u2019re going to stop it\u2019.\n\n\fHe went on to accuse de Klerk of pursuing a double agenda towards the ANC,\nof talking peace and cooperation while simultaneously \u2018conducting a war\u2019\nagainst it. Even while negotiating, the government was secretly funding covert\norganisations that committed violence against the ANC. It was all well and good\nfor de Klerk to pretend, as he had done at the time of the Inkathagate scandal,\nthat he knew nothing about the large sums of money being channelled through\nthe police to the ANC\u2019s main rival, but, he said, \u2018if the head of state doesn\u2019t\nknow when as much as  million rands is spent, then he\u2019s not fit to be a head of\nthe government\u2019.\nMandela concluded by saying he was nevertheless willing to continue to work\nwith de Klerk: \u2018I am prepared to make allowances because he is a product of\napartheid. Although he wants these democratic changes, he has sometimes very\nlittle idea of what democracy means.\u2019\nCaught off guard by Mandela\u2019s venomous outburst, de Klerk began by taking\nnotes. Then he put down his pen and stroked his bald pate, becoming\nincreasingly agitated. By the time Mandela had finished, he was apoplectic. He\nreturned to the podium to make an angry rebuttal of Mandela\u2019s accusations.\nThe two sides, he said, had met innumerable times over the previous ten\nmonths to try to resolve the issue of Umkhonto. Both he and Mandela had\nintervened personally to try to break the deadlock, but to no avail. They had last\ndiscussed the matter on  December and had agreed that further high-level\nconsultations were needed: \u2018The friendly exchanges that went on over the past\nfew days resulted in absolute stalemate.\u2019\nHence his decision to raise the issue in public. It was an issue that had to be\nsolved before other agreements could be reached. Otherwise, de Klerk said, the\ngovernment would be faced with an ANC carrying \u2018a pen in one hand and\nclaiming the right to still have arms in the other hand\u2019.\nThe spectacle on prime-time television of a white head of state being given a\ndressing-down by a black politician, accusing him of duplicity, trickery and even\ncollusion in murder, was an altogether new experience for South Africans. Even\nthough the two men made the point of shaking hands afterwards, it was evident\nthat they had lost all mutual respect. Neither of them understood the other\u2019s\npredicament over the issue of armed struggle. Both were under strong pressure\nfrom their own constituencies to take a firm stand. But by choosing a ceremonial\noccasion to bring the dispute into the open, de Klerk not only ruined the display\n\n\fof goodwill it was intended to convey but incurred severe damage to his own\nreputation as a strong leader. In front of the cameras, a discernible shift in power\nhad taken place.\nThe relationship between Mandela and de Klerk never recovered from this\nincident. De Klerk believed that Mandela had neither the authority nor the\npolitical will to ensure that the ANC adhered to agreements with the\ngovernment. Mandela was all the more convinced of de Klerk\u2019s double agenda\nto destroy the ANC. Their lack of trust made the search for a settlement even\nmore complicated, just as negotiations were beginning.\nThe differences in their objectives were already fundamental. De Klerk\nentered the negotiations with the purpose not of transferring power but of\nstriking a unique power-sharing deal which would ensure that government in a\ndemocratic South Africa was subject to a white veto. His model of majority rule\nwas not the standard version\u2014\u2018simple majority rule\u2019, as he disparagingly\nreferred to it\u2014but a constitution which would entrench the position of minority\nparties in government and restrain majority parties through an elaborate system\nof checks.\nHe had moved on from the idea of group rights to the idea of blocking\nmechanisms. What he proposed was government through an enforced coalition,\nwith a rotating presidency, in which decisions were taken by consensus, thus\ngiving the white minority an effective veto over the majority. He wanted extra\nrepresentation for white minorities in an upper house of parliament with veto\npowers, coupled with the requirement for certain legislation in the lower house\nto obtain specially high majorities before passage. He also wanted regional\nauthorities to be given autonomous powers to curb the possibility of centralised\nauthoritarian rule. Summing up his position, he said, \u2018A party that wins  per\ncent of the vote should not get  per cent of the power.\u2019\nIn de Klerk\u2019s view, the purpose of Codesa was to settle, in a multiparty forum,\nas many of these constitutional details as possible before the negotiating circus\nmoved on to an elected assembly, where the influence of minority parties was\nbound to be reduced. He wanted Codesa first to draw up an \u2018interim\u2019\nconstitution, setting out principles that would include permanently entrenched\npower-sharing, the devolution of power, protection for minorities and other\nchecks and balances, before proceeding with elections for a constituent assembly\nand an interim government that would rule for at least ten years.\n\n\fHe repeatedly insisted that the National Party would never surrender to\n\u2018simple majority rule\u2019, leaving the fate of the white minority of  per cent in the\nhands of a non-racial electorate. It would demand a guaranteed share in power,\nwhatever the outcome of the popular vote, and it would hold out for as long as\nwas necessary to obtain one. Only when the National Party\u2019s future was secure\nwas he prepared to relinquish sole power.\nMandela embarked on the negotiations with the aim of achieving unfettered\nmajority rule in the shortest possible time. He assumed that the government\u2019s\nvulnerability to international pressure, popular unrest and economic disruption,\nthe very factors which he believed had led de Klerk to release him and lift the\nban on the ANC in the first place, would work to his advantage in securing a\nspeedy victory.\nHis aim was to move on rapidly from Codesa to an interim government and to\nan elected assembly empowered to determine a new constitution. The ANC\nwanted a radical rupture with the past. In Mandela\u2019s view, Codesa\u2019s purpose was\nmerely to decide what measures were needed before an assembly could be\nelected. He was anxious to achieve quick results. The slow progress so far made\non the road to majority rule since  had added to the volume of criticism he\nfaced from within the ANC. Moreover, the ANC\u2019s support in the townships was\nbeing undermined daily as a result of the level of violence there and its inability\nto provide protection.\n\nWhile Codesa\u2019s working groups grappled with these issues, there were signs that\nde Klerk\u2019s support within the white community was dwindling. Since the\nannouncement of his reforms in February , the right wing had kept up a\nbarrage of attacks on de Klerk, denouncing him as a traitor and a sell-out\u2014\u2018the\nonly leader in the Western world who is negotiating himself, his party and his\npeople out of power,\u2019 railed the Conservative Party leader, Andries Treurnicht.\nTreurnicht\u2019s objective became the establishment of an independent white state\n\u2014an Afrikaner volkstaat. He offered no suggestions as to what its borders might\nbe or how it might be brought about. There was not a single magisterial district\nin South Africa where whites, let alone Afrikaners, actually constituted a\nmajority of inhabitants. But it was an idea with immense appeal to the\nConservative Party, as well as to other factions on the far right. \u2018We in the\nConservative Party are adamant that there is a territory which belongs\n\n\fhistorically and otherwise to the white nation,\u2019 said Treurnicht. \u2018While we accept\nthat there are whites who are prepared to live under an ANC government in a\nunitary state, there are others\u2014we believe, the majority\u2014who will never submit\nthemselves to a communist terrorist regime. . . Unless any future constitutional\ndispensation addresses the problems of ethnicity and self-determination, it will\nbe a waste of time and a recipe for discord.\u2019 He pledged \u2018a third freedom\nstruggle\u2019 in pursuit of Afrikaner self-determination, alluding to the possibility of\nresistance similar to that of the Boers in the two wars against British imperial\nrule in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. \u2018You do not have\nenough jails to keep Afrikaner nationalism imprisoned,\u2019 he declared. \u2018We warn:\nthis is an unfair government which no longer represents the volk.\u2019\nTreurnicht\u2019s Conservative Party represented the respectable face of the far\nright. Other groups advocated outright violence. The most prominent was the\nAfrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, which\nused Nazi-style insignia and rituals and paraded with swastika-like banners and\nguns. Led by Eugene Terre\u2019Blanche, a former policeman who specialised in\nrightwing oratory and bombast, the AWB was the moving force behind the\nformation of scores of \u2018commando\u2019 units. \u2018We refuse to be put under an ANC\ngovernment,\u2019 declared Terre\u2019Blanche. \u2018That night there will be war in South\nAfrica. . . . We will fight, as our forefathers fought, until we have won.\u2019 In one\ntown after another, white vigilante groups sprang up \u2018to protect white property,\nwomen and children against blacks\u2019. Along with vigilante action came a spate of\nbomb attacks and \u2018driveby\u2019 shootings. In August , hundreds of AWB\nmembers, armed with knives, guns and teargas canisters, clashed with police in\nVentersdorp in an attempt to prevent de Klerk from addressing a public meeting\nthere.\nThe first electoral shock for de Klerk came in a parliamentary by-election in\nthe Orange Free State in November , when the National Party lost its seat to\nthe Conservative Party in a spectacular swing against the government. In\nFebruary , the National Party suffered another stunning defeat in the\nAfrikaner university town of Potchefstroom. The government\u2019s faltering support\nwas of more than usual significance, for de Klerk had repeatedly promised that\nthe white electorate would be allowed the final verdict on any agreement made\nabout South Africa\u2019s future constitution. Rising white opposition to the\ngovernment therefore placed the whole outcome of the negotiations in jeopardy.\nRather than delay the matter any further, within days of the Potchefstroom\n\n\fdefeat de Klerk announced the holding of a white referendum on the reform\nprocess on  March. A clear majority in favour, he said, would obviate the need\nfor the government to return to the white electorate. The risks he took were\nconsiderable. A defeat for the government would almost certainly have led to\ncivil war. All the resources of the white establishment were thrown into securing\na \u2018Yes\u2019 vote. De Klerk explicitly promised the electorate that he would prevent\nmajority rule. The National Party\u2019s advertising campaign was based on the\nslogan, \u2018Vote Yes, if you\u2019re scared of majority rule\u2019. The Conservative Party\ncampaigned for a \u2018No\u2019 vote, claiming that the choice for Afrikaners was between\n\u2018the survival of the Afrikaner volk and two cars in the garage\u2019. The ANC did its\nbest to support the \u2018Yes\u2019 campaign, reassuring whites about its good intentions\nin the negotiating process and promising job security for civil servants.\nThe result was a triumph for de Klerk. About  per cent of the white\nelectorate of . million turned out to vote and some  per cent said \u2018Yes\u2019.\nOnly one out of fifteen regions recorded a majority \u2018No\u2019 vote\u2014Pietersburg, in\nthe strongly conservative northern Transvaal. Even Pretoria, which had for so\nlong symbolised Afrikanerdom in all its might, produced a  per cent \u2018Yes\u2019\nvote. \u2018Today,\u2019 said de Klerk, \u2018we have closed the book on apartheid. It doesn\u2019t\noften happen that in one generation a nation gets an opportunity to rise above\nitself. The white electorate has risen above itself in this referendum.\u2019\n\nIn the euphoria which followed the referendum, there seemed few other\nobstacles remaining in the way of a settlement. Negotiators in several of the\nworking groups held behind closed doors at Codesa reported making significant\nprogress. Indeed, Codesa was noted for its convivial and cosy atmosphere, where\nparticipants, wining and dining at the state\u2019s expense, were afforded every\nopportunity to settle their differences. As the deadline approached for the second\nplenary session, scheduled for  May, public expectations were high.\nThe reality, however, was that the two main participants\u2014the government and\nthe ANC\u2014had come no closer to agreement on what the real role of Codesa\nshould be, let alone the details of a new constitution. In the working groups\ndealing with the central issues of power-sharing and majority rule, the\ndifferences were as fundamental as ever. The government was prepared to\nhaggle indefinitely, believing that the slower the transition proceeded, the better.\nIts confidence was bolstered by the result of the referendum, which had finally\n\n\fdispensed with the rightwing threat de Klerk feared so much. The ANC,\nhowever, was alarmed not only by the lack of progress being made at Codesa but\nalso by signs that it had begun to lose touch with its constituency as the\nnegotiations dragged on. Radicals within the ANC were highly critical of its\nhandling of the negotiations and demanded a more aggressive approach.\nWhen Codesa  reached deadlock on  May, Mandela and de Klerk met over\ncoffee late that night in their first encounter since the opening day in December.\nThough they could not find a way out of the impasse, both were anxious to avoid\na public confrontation. \u2018The whole of South Africa and the world is looking at\nyou and me,\u2019 Mandela told de Klerk. \u2018Let us save the peace process. Let us reach\nsome kind of agreement. Let us at least fix a date for the next round of talks.\u2019\nThey agreed to address the convention the following day in a constructive\nmanner, de Klerk speaking first, Mandela last.\nDe Klerk reiterated the government\u2019s position on the need for \u2018proper checks\nand balances\u2019 to ensure that \u2018no majority should ever be able to misuse its power\n. . . to dominate or to damage the interests of minorities\u2019. He rejected once more\nthe idea of \u2018simple majoritarianism\u2019 of \u2018a winner-takes-all\u2019 electoral system.\nFollowing him, Mandela tried to disperse the gloom which had descended\nover the convention, stressing the areas of agreement that had been reached\nthere. But there was no disguising the fact that the negotiating process, on which\nso many hopes were based, had foundered.\nThe ANC now drew up alternative plans. It was just the opportunity for which\nrevolutionary enthusiasts had been waiting. \fCHAPTER \nWINNIE\u2019S DOWNFALL\nTHE DOWNFALL OF WINNIE BEGAN NOT AS A RESULT OF HER\nCRIMINAL activities but because of her affair with the young lawyer Dali\nMpofu. When they met, Winnie was fifty-five and Mpofu was twenty-five. An\narticled clerk for the law firm representing members of Mandela United, he was\nintelligent, charming and had a liking for older women. While a law student at\nthe University of the Witwatersrand, he had struck up a relationship with a white\nlecturer ten years his senior, Terry Oakley-Smith, the daughter of a retired\nBritish diplomat. She became pregnant, but soon after the birth of their son in\n, Winnie lured Mpofu away. When Oakley-Smith confronted Winnie about\ntheir involvement one night outside Mpofu\u2019s flat, pointing out that Winnie was a\ngrandmother, she was given a foretaste of the kind of threats Winnie habitually\nused against her adversaries. \u2018Winnie\u2019s reply was something along the lines of,\n\u201cListen, my girl, you\u2019ll be sorry for this. You don\u2019t know who you\u2019re dealing\nwith,\u201d\u2019 recalled Oakley-Smith, who then received a barrage of threatening phone\ncalls from Winnie, often late at night when she was drunk, telling her in a slurred\nvoice to keep away from Mpofu. She was so worried by the threats that she\nmade a statement to her lawyers in case she came to harm.\nWhen Mandela in prison learned that Mpofu had moved in with Winnie, he\nsent her a letter telling her to get \u2018that boy\u2019 out of the house. Mpofu left, but the\naffair continued. From the moment that Mandela returned home to Johannesburg\nin February , Winnie showed no interest in sharing his bed. The pain and\nhumiliation for Mandela were some of the worst experiences he had known.\nThey made him, he later recalled, \u2018the loneliest man\u2019.\nWhile the affair remained relatively discreet, Mandela bore it with fortitude,\nenjoying what he could of Winnie\u2019s company, but Winnie soon began to flaunt\nher lover in public. In March , she appointed Mpofu as her deputy in the\nANC\u2019s department of social welfare, even though he had no qualifications for\nthe job. The department which was responsible for the welfare of thousands of\n\n\freturning exiles, former political prisoners and the victims of political violence\nbecame notorious for its chaos under Winnie\u2019s rule. When Ramaphosa took over\nas secretary-general in July , two months after Winnie\u2019s conviction for\nkidnapping and assault, he quickly set about reorganising the ANC\u2019s\nadministration, trying to turn it into a more professional organisation and to rid it\nof embarrassing encumbrances like Winnie. But initially he ran straight into\nopposition from Mandela, who regarded his plans for reorganisation as much a\nthreat to his own authority as to Winnie\u2019s position.\nWinnie, however, soon overstepped the mark. In October , she took\nMpofu with her on a spending spree to the United States. Ostensibly, they went\nto raise money and recruit artistes for a \u2018Children of Africa Concert\u2019, scheduled\nto be held in Nigeria later in the year. But they raised no funds, signed up no\nartistes, and instead drew considerable attention to their extravagant lifestyle.\nMandela was outraged when he learned of what had happened. But Winnie\nignored him and made plans for another trip to the United States with Mpofu,\nwithout informing him.\nAfter two years of forlorn hope of re-establishing a family life, he moved out\nof Winnie\u2019s \u2018palace\u2019 in Soweto. He lived for a time at the opulent mansion of\none of South Africa\u2019s wealthiest Afrikaners, Douw Steyn, an insurance magnate,\nin the northern suburbs of Johannesburg, before purchasing a comfortable twostorey house in Houghton which he came to regard as home. He rarely spoke to\nWinnie after that.\nThe Winnie saga was still to cause him endless embarrassment though. In\nMarch , just weeks before her appeal was due to be heard, she became\nembroiled in an ugly wrangle with her co-defendant, Xoliswa Falati. Falati,\nwhose appeal was due to be heard at the same time, had been told by her lawyer\nthat there were no funds to pay for the costs of her appeal and that therefore she\nwould have no option but to serve her sentence of six years\u2019 imprisonment. The\nnews came as a severe shock to Falati, who had hitherto assumed that the\nMandelas would see that she was properly represented. Her lawyer suggested\nthat she contact Mandela and, when she did, Mandela reassured her that he\nwould take care of the problem.\nThe following day,  March, Falati received a telephone call from Winnie\ntelling her to get out of the room at the back of the garage at Mandela\u2019s old\nhouse in Orlando, where she had been allowed to stay. Falati called Mandela for\n\n\fhelp again. He told her to ignore Winnie and to stay in the room.\nThat night, after a few drinks, Winnie burst into Falati\u2019s room, brandishing a\nsmall pistol and shouting at her to get out. \u2018She came at me like a mad woman,\u2019\nFalati said later. \u2018I saw her pistol and just pushed her and ran.\u2019 Winnie\u2019s driver\nstopped her at the gate. \u2018For a moment I thought I was going to be shot. Winnie\nwas drunk and screaming at me that I was going to prison.\u2019 After throwing\nFalati\u2019s clothes out into the street, Winnie locked the room and stormed off.\nWhen she had gone, Falati made two telephone calls, one to Mandela and one\nto the local newspaper, The Sowetan, telling them what had happened. The\nSowetan immediately sent a reporter and a photographer to the scene. When they\narrived, Falati began telling them how she had \u2018protected\u2019 Winnie and how\nWinnie was \u2018dumping me now that I have served my purpose\u2019. Shortly\nafterwards, Mandela arrived, clearly embarrassed by the whole business, asked\nFalati not to talk to the press and urged the reporter not to write the story. He\nlater telephoned The Sowetan\u2019s editor three times to inquire about the paper\u2019s\nintentions. When the editor and the reporter called on Mandela to discuss the\nincident, he pleaded with them to play it down. It could ruin Winnie\u2019s chances of\na successful appeal, he said. Mandela\u2019s intervention, however, made The\nSowetan all the more determined to publish the story and it duly appeared on \nMarch.\nWinnie\u2019s petty act of vengeance against Falati reignited the whole controversy\nover the murders of both Stompie Moeketsi Seipei and Dr Asvat. Fearing for her\nlife, Falati agreed to tell ANC officials all that she knew. Falati now claimed that\nshe had lied at her trial to try to save Winnie from being convicted; that Winnie\nhad been involved in the torture of Stompie and had ordered the murder of Asvat\nbecause he had seen Stompie in her house shortly before his death; that she had\nordered other deaths, including the murder of a senior journalist on The Sowetan\nwho had been investigating her criminal activities; and that only four months\nbefore she had drawn up a list of five other people whom she wanted\nassassinated, including Cyril Rama - phosa. Falati\u2019s allegations duly appeared in\nthe press. She said she was not prepared to go to prison for \u2018an ungrateful\nwoman\u2019.\nStill more damaging evidence against Winnie surfaced. Her driver, John\nMorgan, who had received a one-year\u2019s suspended sentence for his role in the\nkidnapping, now claimed, like Falati, that he had lied in court to \u2018protect\u2019\n\n\fWinnie. In a press interview published on  April, he said that Winnie was not\nonly present at the house during Stompie\u2019s beating but led the assault. He\ndescribed how, pointing to Stompie\u2019s prostrate body, she told him \u2018to pick up the\ndog and dump him\u2019\u2014which, he said, he refused to do. \u2018I knew he was dead\nbecause he had already been stabbed and had blood on his neck.\u2019 Morgan made\nthe same allegations on national television.\nPress investigations now added further details. From Lusaka, the missing\nwitness, Katiza Cebekhulu, told a lawyer acting on behalf of the Christian\nScience Monitor that Winnie had ordered Dr Asvat\u2019s murder because he could\nhave given evidence of her part in Stompie\u2019s death. In Johannesburg, Dr Asvat\u2019s\nfamily now demanded that the case of his murder be reopened.\nMandela was left with no option other than to distance himself publicly from\nWinnie. He still felt personally responsible for what had happened to her, but the\nextent of the damage both to the ANC and to his own reputation could now be\ncontained only by an announcement of their separation. The media was already\ncritical of his role in trying to suppress The Sowetan\u2019s story about Winnie.\nRamaphosa and Sisulu went to see him to press him to reach a decision.\nFor a man as intensely private as Mandela, with such a strong dislike of\ndiscussing his personal affairs and difficulties even with friends, the ordeal of\nhaving to announce the end of the marriage which he had cherished so deeply\nbefore the massed ranks of the world\u2019s media required all the discipline he could\nmuster. He accomplished it with great dignity, but with barely disguised anguish.\nFlanked by his old friends Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo, in a room at the\nANC\u2019s headquarters in Johannesburg, he made a statement to journalists on \nApril notable for its generosity, paying tribute to \u2018Comrade Nomzamo\u2019, as he\ncalled Winnie, for her devotion to him and to the anti-apartheid struggle:\nOwing to the pressures of our shared commitment to the ANC and the struggle\nto end apartheid, we were unable to enjoy a normal family life. Despite these\npressures our love for each other and our devotion to our marriage grew and\nintensified. . . .\nDuring the two decades I spent on Robben Island, she was an indispensable\npillar of support and comfort to myself personally. . . . Comrade Nomzamo\naccepted the onerous burden of raising our children on her own. She endured the\npersecution heaped upon her by the government with exemplary fortitude and\nnever wavered from her commitment to the freedom struggle. Her tenacity\n\n\freinforced my personal respect, love and growing affection. It also attracted the\nadmiration of the world at large. My love for her remains undiminished.\nHowever, in view of the tensions that have arisen owing to differences\nbetween ourselves on a number of issues in recent months, we have mutually\nagreed that a separation would be best for each of us. My action was not\nprompted by the current allegations being made against her in the media. . . .\nComrade Nomzamo has and can continue to rely on my unstinting support\nduring these trying moments in her life.\nI shall personally never regret the life Comrade Nomzamo and I tried to share\ntogether. Circumstances beyond our control, however, dictated it should be\notherwise. I part from my wife with no recriminations. I embrace her with all the\nlove and affection I have nursed for her inside and outside prison from the\nmoment I first met her.\nReading the statement had left Mandela drained and exhausted. Rising from\nhis seat, he appealed to the press: \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you appreciate\nthe pain I have gone through.\u2019 Then, in silence, he walked stiffly from the room.\nBehind the scenes, Ramaphosa now went to work to force Winnie\u2019s\n\u2018retirement from politics\u2019. He wanted her resignation both from her position as\nhead of the social welfare department and from membership of the ANC\u2019s\nnational executive committee. But Winnie fought back tenaciously. All that she\nagreed to do was to resign as head of the social welfare department.\nOn  April, at a press conference announcing her resignation from the\ndepartment, she remained defiant, protesting her innocence of any crimes and\nblaming her predicament on those who wished to destroy her and discredit the\nANC:\nThe step I am taking is not because of the false allegations being made against\nme but because of the devotion that I have for the ANC and my family. Over the\nyears, many have tried to divide and weaken the ANC. They have failed, and\nthey will fail again. I have taken this step because I consider it to be in the best\ninterest of the ANC, whose cause and policies I will support until the end of my\nlife.\nWinnie lost no time strengthening her popularity with radical youth groups\nand squatter communities, determined to present herself as the champion of the\npoor and dispossessed, with a powerful constituency of her own. Within days,\n\n\fshe appeared at one scene of township violence after another, berating the\ngovernment and Inkatha and fulminating against the negotiations process. \u2018We\nare certainly not going to keep on talking to a government that is killing our\npeople,\u2019 she said. On national television, she declared, \u2018As far as I am\nconcerned, my political career goes on as if nothing had happened.\u2019\nShe used her position as leader of the ANC\u2019s Women\u2019s League in the\nJohannesburg region to instigate a march demanding her reinstatement as head\nof the social welfare department, an action that created turmoil in the Women\u2019s\nLeague. One attempt after another was made to dislodge her, but she clung on\nwith a vengeance.\nThe end, however, was nigh. In May , ANC officials announced that they\nwere conducting an investigation into charges that Winnie and her dismissed\ndeputy, Dali Mpofu, had been responsible for the disappearance of ,\nrands from the department of social welfare. While the investigation was\nproceeding, they came into possession of a letter Winnie had written to Mpofu\non  March , one month before her resignation as head of the department.\nThe letter was leaked to South African newspapers and appeared in print on \nSeptember , making her position untenable.\nIt was four pages long, written by hand, mostly in English but with occasional\nphrases in Xhosa, and blazed with anger and venom about Mpofu\u2019s affairs with\nother women. Winnie admitted that she had agreed to Mpofu having another\nrelationship \u2018as a cover to defuse our problem\u2019, even though she \u2018shuddered at\nthe thought of you lying and pretending to love this other woman\u2019. But that did\nnot mean Mpofu could go \u2018running around fucking at the slightest emotional\nexcuse\u2019. She accused him of deceiving her and complained about his \u2018shabby\ntreatment\u2019 of her: \u2018You have hurt and humiliated me as a woman.\u2019 She grumbled\nabout his indifference to how \u2018the situation is deteriorating at home\u2019\u2014she had\nnot been speaking to Mandela for five months. Yet Mpofu had not bothered\nbecause he was out every night satisfying himself with another woman.\nAmid this tirade were references to bank accounts which proved fatal. Winnie\nberated Mpofu over his lack of concern about her financial problems, mentioned\nhow much money she had spent on him and spoke of her fears about the\ninvestigation into the accounts of the social welfare department. \u2018I tell you I\u2019m in\ntrouble with the Simmons Street a/c which reflects over R, drawn over a\nperiod for you,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018You don\u2019t even bother to check how we can\n\n\fovercome this.\u2019 Mandela, she said, had ordered an inquiry into her account. Her\nsecretary at the department of social welfare, Ntombi, was talking to the\ninvestigators: \u2018I tell you Ntombi is gossiping about the cheques we used to ask\nher to cash for in the name of the Dpt and how I gave you all that money.\u2019\nMandela was shown a copy of the letter before it was published in the press.\nHe recognised the handwriting and the style and knew that certain details, such\nas Winnie\u2019s assertion that they had not spoken for five months, were accurate.\nHe decided to ask George Bizos to take a copy to Winnie to check its\nauthenticity. According to Mandela, \u2018she broke down and wept\u2019.\nFour days later, Winnie resigned from all her remaining posts in the ANC,\nfrom the national executive committee and the Women\u2019s League, with an\nemotional outburst against her \u2018enemies\u2019 inside and outside the organisation and\ndisplaying deep-rooted delusions about her own importance. In a rambling\nstatement to a press conference, she gave no clear explanation of why she had\ndecided to resign other than to say it was \u2018primarily in the interest of my dear\nhusband and my beloved family\u2019.\nAddressing herself to her family \u2018and to all my people in South Africa, in our\nsquatter camps, in our villages, in the violence-torn and poverty-stricken areas\u2019,\nshe said, \u2018There is no reason to be overwhelmed by a sense of isolation and\nabandonment. I have only been a mere servant to you and I will always be.\u2019\nHowever, Winnie\u2019s ambition was not so easily thwarted.\n\nIn October , a glittering wedding reception, attended by  guests, was\nheld in the ballroom of the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg to celebrate the\nwedding of Zindzi Mandela and Zwelibansi Hlongwane, a shop-owner several\nyears her junior. Zindzi\u2019s life had been marked by personal dramas as much as\nher mother\u2019s. She had borne four children from four different fathers, one of\nwhom savagely assaulted her, leaving her for dead, and another of whom, a\nMandela United gangster, committed suicide. Beneath the glamour of the\noccasion, there were turbulent undercurrents. Mandela treated Winnie as if she\ndid not exist, not addressing a word to her. He appeared so grim at times that an\nold friend, Helen Suzman, passed up a note to him: \u2018Smile, Nelson! You look\nlike John Vorster used to in parliament! \u2019 He read the note, burst into a radiant\nsmile briefly, then lapsed again into a sphinx-like stare.\n\n\fIn his speech to the guests, he reflected on the plight of his family: \u2018We\nwatched our children growing without our guidance and when we did come out\n[of prison], my children, for example, said, \u201cWe thought we had a father and one\nday he\u2019d come back. But to our dismay, our father comes back and he leaves us\nalone almost daily because he has now become the father of the nation.\u201d\u2019\nMandela said he had often pondered on whether the struggle had been worth the\nloss of a normal family life but had always concluded, \u2018It was, it is, the correct\ndecision that we should commit ourselves.\u2019\n THE SUNSET CLAUSE\nSOON AFTER THE CODESA NEGOTIATIONS REACHED DEADLOCK,\nTHE ANC announced a campaign of mass action: a series of rolling strikes,\ndemonstrations and boycotts across the country, intended to force the\ngovernment to back down at the negotiating table. The campaign was to be\norganised with the help of the ANC\u2019s allies, the trade union federation, Cosatu,\nand the South African Communist Party. Its climax would be a general strike.\nMost groups within the \u2018tripartite alliance\u2019 regarded mass action as a\nnecessary component of the negotiating process. A show of strength on the\nstreets, bringing industry to a halt, would make the government more amenable,\nthey believed. A radical faction within the Communist Party, however, saw mass\naction not as a means of gaining compromises but as a way of bringing the\ngovernment down. These \u2018insurrectionists\u2019, as they were known, pointed to\nevents in Eastern Europe, especially to Leipzig, where street demonstrations had\nhelped topple the East German regime three years before, and believed that the\nsame result could be engineered in South Africa.\nAmong those favouring the \u2018Leipzig option\u2019 was Ronnie Kasrils, a member of\nthe Communist Party\u2019s central committee, a former Umkhonto intelligence chief\nand a member of the ANC\u2019s national executive committee. A middle-aged man\ndriven by boyish enthusiasm for revolutionary exploits and clearly bored by the\nproceedings at Codesa, which he rarely attended, Kasrils had been agitating for\nmonths for mass action. With the failure of Codesa, he was given his chance and\nput in charge of organising the ANC\u2019s campaign. He dubbed it Operation Exit.\nThe ANC\u2019s strategy carried high risks. Mass action was to be launched at a\ntime when many townships were in turmoil. The Reef war continued unabated.\nAll previous experience of strikes, boycotts and demonstrations showed that they\nled to an upsurge in violence as supporters resorted to coercion to get their way.\nThe risk now was that the turmoil and the violence might become\nuncontrollable.\n\n\fThe date chosen for the start of the mass action campaign was  June, the\nanniversary of the beginning of the Soweto revolt in . Dressed in a track\nsuit and wearing a baseball cap, Mandela marched at the head of a column of\nANC supporters through the streets of Soweto to the Orlando football stadium to\nlaunch the campaign. Addressing the huge crowd packing the stands, he\nexplained the need for mass action: \u2018The National Party wants a system where\npeople can vote but the result is fixed beforehand. All parties, they say, would\nhave veto powers.\u2019 So if an ANC majority in government wanted to change\napartheid policies on education or housing, they would be able to do so only\nwith the consent of the white minority. Negotiations had not budged de Klerk, he\nsaid, so the time had come for a change of strategy. In the face of violence\ndeliberately planned by the security forces and their \u2018vigilantes\u2019, the ANC\u2019s\ncodeword for Inkatha, it was imperative, he said, that ANC supporters set about\nthe protests peacefully. It was even more imperative to resist suggestions from\nwithin the ANC\u2019s ranks to take the violence to white areas. \u2018This would be a\ndisaster of the first magnitude. We don\u2019t want innocent people killed, black or\nwhite.\u2019\nA mass stayaway the ANC organised for  June was judged to be a success.\nThe following night, however, there occurred an incident of such brutality that,\njust like Sharpeville and Soweto, its name came to be remembered around the\nworld and to represent another grim landmark in the passage of South Africa\u2019s\nviolent history. It plunged South Africa into a crisis far worse than anyone had\nexpected.\nOn  June, a group of Inkatha hostel dwellers in Boipatong, a small township\nin the Vaal Triangle, forty miles south of Johannesburg, attacked a nearby shack\nsettlement, kicking in doors, smashing windows and then hacking, stabbing and\nshooting residents at random in a killing spree that lasted more than four hours,\nleaving forty-five residents, mostly woman and children, dead. It was the fourth\nmass killing that week in a black area near Johannesburg. The police were once\nagain accused of collusion. Two days later, three people died when police\nopened fire on a crowd which had gathered to protest at the massacre.\nThe event propelled Mandela into the radical camp. He suspended all talks\nwith the government, saying, \u2018I can no longer explain to our people why we\ncontinue to talk to a regime that is murdering our people and conducting war\nagainst us.\u2019 His language became increasingly intemperate. He described the\nactivities of the National Party and its Inkatha allies as similar to Nazi attacks on\n\n\fJews. \u2018They are killing our people in an effort to stop the ANC getting into\npower,\u2019 he said. The negotiations process was \u2018completely in tatters\u2019. When\nhardline members on the ANC national executive committee argued that\nnegotiations had proved useless and should be abandoned altogether, Mandela\nwas inclined to agree. Among rank and file supporters, there was a huge\ngroundswell in favour of reverting to armed struggle. Placards waved at Mandela\nduring a rally to mark the Boipatong massacre read, \u2018Mandela, we want arms\nnow\u2019 and \u2018Victory through battle not talk\u2019.\nMandela refused to believe that de Klerk did not have the power to curb the\nviolence. In his mind, there were only two possible explanations for why it\ncontinued: either the security forces were out of control or de Klerk was\nconniving with them. \u2018In my view, he might not be aware of every attack. But\ngenerally speaking, the fact that the police and security services are involved, he\nwould know very well,\u2019 Mandela said in July. \u2018A head of state who does not\nknow the things that are happening is not fit to be a head of state.\u2019\n\nMuch to de Klerk\u2019s embarrassment, there was a continuing trickle of evidence\nimplicating security forces in violent activity. In April , a white police\ncaptain and four black \u2018special constables\u2019 were convicted of the killing of\neleven people\u2014six women, three men and two children\u2014in a small rural\nsettlement in Natal whom they believed were supporters of the ANC. The\n\u2018special constables\u2019 were Inkatha men who had been selected and trained by the\npolice. The judge\u2019s verdict was that the massacre was part of a security force\noperation to disrupt the community, oust an established ANC-aligned residents\u2019\nassociation and give Inkatha control of the area. The judge said he was\nconvinced that there had been a conspiracy among senior officers reaching up to\npolice headquarters to cover up the crime. In his evidence, the police captain,\nBrian Mitchell, said he saw himself as a soldier in a civil war in which the\nenemy were pro-ANC groups. The murders had been carried out in , but\nMitchell\u2019s views were still common among white police officers.\nThe military were also implicated. In May , the press published the\ncontents of a military intelligence signal proposing the \u2018permanent removal\u2019 of\nthree prominent black activists in the Eastern Cape. Two weeks after the signal\nwas sent, the killing of two of them took place, along with two other activists.\nThe incident occurred in , but the disclosure seven years later of military\n\n\finvolvement not only stirred black anger against the army but reinforced all the\nfears and suspicions already harboured about the activities of a \u2018third force\u2019. The\nman who authorised the signal was Brigadier Christoffel van der Westhuizen,\nthen head of joint operations at the Eastern Cape Prov - ince command. In ,\nvan der Westhuizen, promoted to the rank of general, was chief of military\nintelligence.\nIt was the Department of Military Intelligence that was the main focus of\nsuspicions. For years, the DMI had been in control of special force operations\nsupporting Renamo rebels in Mozambique and Unita rebels in Angola fighting\nto overthrow Marxist governments. It had also been involved in training Inkatha\nmembers. The units which the DMI had run across South Africa\u2019s borders\u2014like\n Battalion, composed mainly of Portuguese-speaking mercenaries\u2014had\nreturned to South Africa once the DMI\u2019s campaign of destabilisation in\nneighbouring countries had come to an end and once the war with Swapo\nguerrillas in Namibia was over. Many senior officers were bitterly resentful of\nthe outcome. In a  message to soldiers who had fought in Angola and\nNamibia, Colonel Jan Breytenbach, a former commander of the much-feared \nBattalion, reflected their discontent. \u2018You did not lose in Angola,\u2019 he told them.\n\u2018You did not lose in Namibia. You were betrayed by politicians under foreign\npressure.\u2019 From their bases in South Africa, these special force units provided a\nready source of recruits for disgruntled officers intent on organising covert\noperations. Other irregular units included Koevoet, a police counter-insurgency\nforce once used in Namibia, many of whose members were now active in the\nSouth African police force. All had been trained to hunt down ANC or Swapo\ncadres in the streets and shebeens of southern Africa and were prone to violent\nand lawless conduct.\nBut as well as anti-ANC groups at work in the townships, the ANC\u2019s own\nself-defence units were running amok. SDUs had been set up with the help of\nUmkhonto with the aim of protecting ANC communities from Inkatha attacks.\nBy mid-, about eighty-five SDUs were in operation. But many of them had\nspun completely out of ANC control and had been taken over by gangsters,\nwarlords and renegade Umkhonto guerrillas. In July , the Communist Party\nleader, Chris Hani, writing in the party\u2019s publication Umsebenzi, admitted that\nthey often served as fronts and shelters for criminals. They had brought about, he\nsaid, \u2018an alarming revival of kangaroo courts and kangaroo politics\u2019. Some had\nbeen infiltrated by police and army agents intent on subverting them.\n\n\fThe task of sorting out the evidence was given to a judicial commission into\npublic violence and intimidation, headed by Judge Richard Goldstone, which\nhad been set up as a result of the  national peace accord. In May ,\nGoldstone published an interim report which concluded that the primary cause of\nthe violence was not security force activity, as Mandela maintained, but the\npolitical battle between supporters of the ANC and Inkatha: \u2018Both sides resort to\nviolence and intimidation in their attempts to gain control over geographic\nareas.\u2019 There would be no lessening of violence \u2018unless and until the leaders and\nsupporters\u2019 of the two factions agreed to disarm and \u2018abandon violence and\nintimidation as political weapons\u2019.\nThe commission exonerated de Klerk himself and his government from any\ndirect involvement in political violence. It had received no evidence justifying\nallegations of \u2018any direct complicity in or planning of current violence\u2019, no\ncredible evidence of a \u2018third force\u2019 at work. But it sharply rebuked the\ngovernment for failing to implement earlier recommendations it had made,\nincluding the need to impose security measures at hostels and to ban the carrying\nof all dangerous weapons. The commission also noted that its previous\nrecommendation regarding the withdrawal from townships of  Battalion,\nwhose members had been found responsible for rape and other assaults during\n\u2018peacekeeping\u2019 operations, had been blocked by the army commander, General\nGeorge Meiring. The government, said the commission, \u2018must be able to\ndemonstrate that it has control over its security forces\u2019.\nPolice actions were also severely criticised. An independent inquiry into the\nBoipatong massacre, carried out with the help of British experts, concluded in\nJuly  that while there was no evidence of police or government complicity,\nthe police were to blame for \u2018a failure of leadership at all levels\u2019. The inquiry\ncastigated the police for \u2018serious incompetence\u2019 throughout its organisation.\n\nFor month after month, as the mass action campaign continued, South Africa\nwas convulsed by strikes, protests and boycotts. All that was left publicly of the\nnegotiations process was an angry exchange of memoranda between Mandela\nand de Klerk. In July, Mandela issued a list of fourteen demands the government\nwould have to meet before talks could be resumed. De Klerk responded with a\nthirty-one-page memorandum, deriding Mandela as a \u2018captive\u2019 of\n\u2018insurrectionists\u2019 in the Communist Party and warning of harsh measures to\n\n\fprevent chaos in the country. Mandela answered with a twenty-four-page\nrebuttal, labelling de Klerk a liar and blatant propagandist suffering from selfdelusion. Negotiations to bring about democracy had failed, he said, because \u2018the\nruling National Party keeps looking for ways to exercise power even if it loses a\ndemocratic election\u2019. His letter contained lengthy appendices charging the\ngovernment with responsibility for political violence: \u2018The acts of omission and\ncommission by government in numerous cases can only be explained in terms of\ndirect complicity in the violence in order to make party political gains at great\ncost in black lives and economic damage to our country.\u2019 Mandela ended with a\nstern admonition to de Klerk:\nFind a way within yourself to recognize the gravity of the crisis. . . . Find a way\nto address the demands we have placed before you . . . so that negotiations can\nbecome meaningful and be vested with the urgency that the situation requires.\nFailure to respond in this way can only exacerbate the crisis. You may succeed\nin delaying, but never in preventing, the transition of South Africa to democracy.\nIn August, the ANC alliance brought the campaign to a climax with a general\nstrike by several million workers. Much of the country\u2019s business and industry\ncame to a halt or was forced to reduce output. The strike was followed by mass\nmarches. In Pretoria, Mandela led more than , supporters through the heart\nof the city to the seat of white government, Union Buildings. \u2018Today we are at\nthe door of Union Buildings,\u2019 declared Ramaphosa. \u2018Next time, F. W. de Klerk,\nwe are going to be inside your office.\u2019 Mandela hailed the strike as\n\u2018unquestionably one of the great events in our history\u2019.\nYet for all the fervour that mass action achieved, it produced nothing in terms\nof forcing any movement in the government\u2019s position. Nor was it a strategy that\nANC supporters could afford to continue indefinitely. The ANC was divided\nover what to do next. Some wanted to seek a way back into negotiation. The\ninitiative, however, lay with Kasrils and his group of insurrectionists. They\nargued that though mass action might not bring Pretoria to its knees, it would\nwork against weaker governments in the homelands, in KwaZulu,\nBophuthatswana and Ciskei, the allies of Pretoria which had so far kept a tight\nclamp on all ANC activity.\nCiskei was a particularly tempting target. It was ruled by a military dictator,\nBrigadier Oupa Gqozo, who had only recently seized power and had\nincreasingly resorted to repressive measures to stay there. All the ANC\u2019s efforts\n\n\fto engage in political activity in Ciskei had been blocked. Mandela had spoken\nseveral times on the phone to Gqozo about the clampdown, and had met him\ntwice in Bisho, the Ciskei capital. \u2018In one of our meetings, we agreed that we\nshould each lead delegations of ten,\u2019 said Mandela. \u2018His delegation was\ncomposed of seven whites and three Africans. All these whites were seconded\nfrom South Africa. We got nowhere.\u2019\nThe insurrectionists believed that a mass march on Bisho from neighbouring\nKing William\u2019s Town, a few miles away across the \u2018border\u2019 in white South\nAfrica, would trigger a switch of allegiance by the Ciskei army and public\nservants, causing the homeland administration to collapse. Kasrils travelled to\nCiskei on a reconnaissance mission and pronounced it ripe for popular\ninsurrection. \u2018I have just spent a week in Ciskei and I have never encountered\nsuch hatred for a despot,\u2019 Kasrils told a reporter. Once Gqozo was overthrown,\nthe next targets would be Lucas Mangope in Bophuthatswana and Buthelezi in\nKwaZulu.\nOn  September, the ANC sent a memorandum to de Klerk demanding that\nGqozo be removed as ruler of Ciskei and replaced by an interim administration\nthat would permit free political activity. De Klerk refused, pointing out Ciskei\u2019s\n\u2018independence\u2019. He sent Mandela three letters warning of the dangers of a\nbloody confrontation and pleading with him to call off the march. Gqozo himself\nissued a warning that he would meet with force any attempt to march on his\ncapital.\nThe march was set for  September. The night before, Gqozo sought an urgent\ncourt order prohibiting the march. A local magistrate granted permission for the\nmarch to take place but ordered that it should not proceed beyond Bisho\u2019s\nindependence stadium, just over the border from white South Africa but more\nthan a mile from the town. The Ciskei police and military, commanded by white\nofficers seconded from Pretoria, were ordered to stop the marchers there.\nIn the morning, a column of , marchers set out from King William\u2019s\nTown along the road to Bisho. Their aim, according to one leading activist, was\n\u2018to drive the pig from the barn\u2019. The border was closed by a line of razor wire,\nwith Ciskei troops deployed behind it. But scouting ahead of the column, Kasrils\nnoticed a gap in the outer fence of the independence stadium alongside the road,\nwhich seemed to offer a route into the centre of Bisho. Returning back down the\nhill to colleagues, Kasrils urged that he should lead a breakaway group from the\n\n\fmain column, storm through the gap and head on to Bisho. \u2018It\u2019s going to be a\ncinch,\u2019 he was overheard to say.\nBut Kasrils had failed to spot a detachment of Ciskei troops covering the gap\nfrom trench positions. As his breakaway group raced through the gap, the troops\nopened fire. Kasrils and other ANC leaders survived. But twenty-eight marchers\nwere killed.\nThe day of the insurrectionists was over.\n\nA mood of deep despondency hung over South Africa during those months in\n. The cycle of violence seemed endless, destroying all prospect of a political\nsettlement. The economy was sunk in the third year of recession, with no end in\nsight. A catastrophic drought had laid waste to farming areas. The very\ninstitutions of government, it seemed, were rotten: the police proven\nincompetent and the military contaminated by dirty tricks. A wave of corruption\nscandals beset the administration. In the case of one government department\ndealing with the homelands, a judge concluded that \u2018millions, if not billions\u2019 of\nrands had been pilfered and misspent. Corruption was everywhere in the air.\nWhite civil servants and politicians scrambled to top up their pension schemes\nand fix long-term contracts before the day of reckoning. Security officials\ninsisted on indemnities. The columnist Shaun Johnson wrote in The Star, \u2018If you\nstand on a street corner in Pretoria late at night, I am sure you can hear the sound\nof shredders shredding. Of assets being stripped. Of pockets being stuffed.\u2019\nThe ANC added to the growing list of scandals. An internal inquiry confirmed\nallegations made by former ANC members that torture and executions had taken\nplace in its camps in Angola during the s. The ANC refused to disclose the\nnames of its torturers, but the press published them, revealing that several were\nserving in high places in the ANC. One of them was a member of Mandela\u2019s\nown bodyguard. What was worse, ANC leaders like Oliver Tambo and Chris\nHani were accused of failing to stop the ill-treatment of its prisoners. Mandela\naccepted \u2018collective responsibility\u2019 for the incidents, but the overall result was to\nleave the ANC\u2019s leadership discredited.\nOn top of all this was the crippling stalemate within the political arena. After\nnearly three years of effort, the politicians had little to show and nothing to offer.\nEach side denied its own responsibility. While they squabbled in public, the field\n\n\fwas left open to insurrectionists like Kasrils to pursue their revolutionary\nfantasies. Whatever confidence there was about the country\u2019s future was rapidly\nebbing away, both at home and abroad.\nSo deep was the crisis that it induced a willingness to compromise that had not\nexisted before. In the wake of Bisho, Mandela reasserted his leadership, called a\nhalt to mass action and severely reprimanded Kasrils. The priority, he said, was\nto haul South Africa \u2018out of the quagmire\u2019. Both he and de Klerk bore\nresponsibility to see that it happened. In a gesture of conciliation to de Klerk,\nonly one week after the Bisho shooting, he compressed the ANC\u2019s fourteen\npreconditions for resuming talks to three. \u2018If Mr de Klerk can just say to me,\n\u201cYou have expressed your three concerns, I give you my undertaking that I will\naddress them,\u201d\u2019 Mandela said in a press interview, \u2018then I will be able to go back\nto my people and say, \u201cLook, he has met us. Let us meet him.\u201d\u2019\nBehind the scenes, ever since talks had been broken off two key negotiators,\nCyril Ramaphosa from the ANC and Roelf Meyer from the government side,\nhad kept in touch in private, trying to pick up the pieces. Meyer had been\nappointed the government\u2019s chief negotiator in June , a few weeks before\nthe Boipatong massacre. He represented a new generation of Afrikaner leader,\nanxious to move ahead with the reforms that de Klerk had initiated in . He\nwas less concerned to protect white privileges from the past than to secure an\naccommodation for whites in the future that would last. With Ramaphosa, he\nstruck up an effective working relationship. Meyer was forty-five; Ramaphosa\nwas forty. Meeting in private in hotel rooms, they managed to establish a\nmeasure of trust which survived amid the turmoil and provided the basis for the\nnegotiation process to resume.\nMeyer and Ramaphosa became convinced that the way out of the impasse was\nfor the government and the ANC to reach a bilateral understanding before\nmultiparty talks continued. For de Klerk, however, the drawback of this\napproach was that bilateral talks between the government and the ANC were\nlikely to jeopardise his hopes of forging an electoral alliance with regional black\nleaders like Buthelezi. Buthelezi\u2019s national support was considered to be of\nminor importance, but his following in KwaZulu-Natal, according to opinion\npolls, was still substantial. His pro-capitalist policies were far more compatible\nwith National Party ideology than the ANC\u2019s plans for \u2018redistribution\u2019.\nMoreover, a significant section of the cabinet, the National Party, the military\nand the police, as well as a coterie of white businessmen in Natal, much\n\n\fpreferred Buthelezi as an ally to the prospect of having to do business with the\nlikes of Mandela.\nBut de Klerk\u2019s overriding concern was to get the negotiations under way\nagain. Reciprocating Mandela\u2019s gesture of conciliation, he issued a public\ninvitation to him to join him in a summit meeting to find a way of ending the\nspiral of violence. Mandela responded positively. The harsh rhetoric he had\nemployed against de Klerk for months on end was dropped. In his garden in\nHoughton late one Sunday afternoon, he mused quietly about de Klerk\u2019s\ndifficulties. \u2018I phoned him two days ago,\u2019 he said, \u2018and I must say he sounded a\nbit down. He is a very brave chap, you know, very bright and confident, and it\nwas worrying to hear him sounding so down.\u2019 In the hurly-burly of South\nAfrican politics, such moments were rare, however, and soon forgotten.\nThe date for the summit was set for  September, less than three weeks after\nthe Bisho shooting. For ten days beforehand, the two sides, led by Meyer and\nRamaphosa, negotiated night and day over the three conditions set by the ANC\nfor resuming talks. All were highly contentious. Two of them required action\nagainst Inkatha: the ANC demanded that Inkatha hostels should be fenced and\nthat Inkatha members should be prohibited from carrying traditional weapons in\npublic. These were demands opposed outright by the pro-Buthelezi faction\nwithin de Klerk\u2019s cabinet. The third demand de Klerk himself opposed. It\ninvolved the release of a number of ANC prisoners, three of whom had been\nsentenced to death for murder, including an Umkhonto member, Robert\nMcBride, who had killed three young white women in a bomb attack outside a\nbar on Durban\u2019s beach-front. In the white community, the idea of releasing such\nconvicted murderers was anathema.\nTwo days before the summit, the ANC\u2019s negotiators reported to Mandela that\nonly one obstacle lay in the way: de Klerk had balked at the release of the three\nmurderers; he had said he would \u2018never\u2019 release them. They proposed a backdown to ensure that the summit went ahead. But Mandela would have none of it.\n\u2018De Klerk needed us more than we needed him,\u2019 Mandela recalled. \u2018He\ndesperately needed that summit.\u2019 Ramaphosa described Mandela\u2019s stubbornness\nover the issue: \u2018He has nerves of steel. Once he has decided that a particular\nissue has to be pursued, everything else matters very little. And he can be very\nharsh when dealing with an opponent who is unreasonable, very brutal in a calm\nand collected sort of way.\u2019\n\n\fMandela spoke to de Klerk on the phone. Either de Klerk agreed to release the\nprisoners, he said, or there would be no summit. Mandela advised de Klerk\nagainst adopting intransigent positions, against saying he would \u2018never\u2019 release\nthe prisoners: \u2018Because you know in the end you are going to give in. Because if\nyou don\u2019t, we are going to humiliate you. And I will see to it that that happens.\u2019\nRamaphosa feared that Mandela had gone too far and told him so, but\nMandela remained relaxed. He laughed and said, \u2018This chap, I have had enough\nof him. We hold the line here today.\u2019 After several more phone calls, de Klerk\nagreed to release the three men.\nAt the summit meeting, Mandela applied the same techniques. Facing strong\nopposition from members of his cabinet over the Inkatha issues, de Klerk\nattempted to prevaricate and asked for more time to study the matter. \u2018Very well,\nMr de Klerk, you can have the time,\u2019 Mandela replied, \u2018provided you understand\nthat when we leave here to have a press conference, I shall say that this meeting\nhas been a total failure.\u2019 De Klerk hastily convened a \u2018working committee\u2019 led\nby Meyer to study the issue; it met over the lunch break and duly approved the\nconcession.\nThe summit ended with Mandela and de Klerk signing what was termed a\nRecord of Understanding, thus breaking the deadlock on constitutional\nnegotiations. But its real significance went even further, for it marked the point\nat which the government was no longer able on its own to control the transition\nprocess, as de Klerk had assumed it always would. Henceforth, government\naction had to take into account the requirements of the ANC. No deal could be\ndone without it. The summit also marked the point at which Mandela gained a\npsychological ascendancy over de Klerk which he was never to lose. Another\nshift in the balance of power had occurred.\nButhelezi reacted to the accord between the government and the ANC with a\nfit of rage, seeing it as a move to leave him on the sidelines while they\nconstructed their own deal. He denounced de Klerk\u2019s \u2018appeasement\u2019 of the ANC\nand warned that his followers would never give up carrying traditional weapons\nand would tear down any fences erected around Inkatha hostels \u2018with their bare\nhands\u2019. He poured scorn on the ANC\u2019s threat to march on his capital, Ulundi,\nreminding it of the grim fate of a British army column which had invaded\nZululand in . Zulus, he said, were ready for \u2018another washing of the spears\u2019.\nButhelezi now played the tribal card for all it was worth, presenting himself as\n\n\fthe defender of all Zulus against external enemies like the ANC and its\ncommunist allies bent on their destruction. At mass rallies, he warned Zulus that\ntheir very existence was at stake, that their foes planned to wipe KwaZulu \u2018off\nthe face of the earth\u2019. Claiming that secret deals were being made, he broke off\nnegotiations with the government, determined to wreck the process.\nMeanwhile, the search for a settlement between the government and the ANC\nbegan in earnest. It received a dramatic boost in October from an unexpected\nquarter: Joe Slovo. Slovo believed that what the ANC needed at this juncture\nwas some \u2018shock therapy\u2019 about its own negotiating position. Just as he had\ntaken the initiative in arguing for the suspension of the armed struggle in ,\nso now he took the lead in proposing a highly controversial compromise in\nnegotiations. Writing in the Communist Party journal African Communist, Slovo\nsuggested that as an alternative to making a bid for total power, it might be\nnecessary for the ANC to offer the government \u2018a sunset clause\u2019 in a new\nconstitution which would entrench power-sharing in a government of national\nunity for a fixed period. The ANC might also have to give ground by offering\nguarantees on regional government, by accepting an amnesty for security\nofficials and by honouring the contracts of civil servants, either by retaining\nthem or by compensating them. \u2018The ANC is not dealing with a defeated enemy;\nan early seizure of power is not realistic; the capacity of the white civil service,\narmy and police to destabilize a newly born democracy is enormous; and a\nsunset clause should be inserted in the new constitution to provide for\ncompulsory power-sharing for a fixed number of years.\u2019 To emphasise the point,\nSlovo warned, \u2018All we will achieve when we have won the election is to gain\npolitical office. We would not gain state power in the sense of having a complete\ntransformation on day one of the police, the armed forces, the judiciary and the\ncivil services.\u2019 Coming from a figure with such impeccable revolutionary\ncredentials, these ideas carried all the more weight.\nSlovo\u2019s suggestions created a furore within the ANC and the Communist\nParty. Hardline communists like Harry Gwala contemptuously dismissed them\nas \u2018bourgeois reformism\u2019. Pallo Jordan, an independent Marxist, claimed Slovo\nwas advocating total \u2018capitulation\u2019. The Slovo scenario, he said, aimed at\nnothing less than enabling \u2018the liberation movement and the regime to ride\nblissfully into the sunset together\u2019. Members of the ANC national executive\ncommittee sceptical of the outcome of the negotiations argued that the National\nParty would never abandon power, no matter what was offered.\n\n\fBut in other quarters in the ANC, the idea of \u2018sunset\u2019 clauses for the white\ncommunity had gained a certain currency. Mandela himself had long believed\nthat a multiparty coalition might be needed in the early years of democratic rule\nto help assuage the fears of minorities. \u2018It may not be enough to work purely on\none-person one-vote,\u2019 he said in , \u2018because every national group would like\nto see that the people of their flesh and blood are in government.\u2019\nThe ANC\u2019s negotiating commission developed Slovo\u2019s ideas into a document\nof its own, entitled \u2018Negotiations: A Strategic Perspective\u2019, which was formally\nadopted in November. Because of the pressure on the ANC to achieve results\nand the government\u2019s ability to \u2018endlessly delay\u2019, it said, there was a need to\nmake compromises and to pursue a swift negotiation process. This process\nwould have to address questions of job security, retrenchment packages and a\ngeneral amnesty for \u2018all armed formations and sections of the civil service\u2019. Of\ncrucial importance, the ANC argued in favour of a government of national unity.\nThe way forward, it suggested, was for the government and the ANC to reach a\nbilateral agreement on those issues before including other parties in a multiparty\nforum. Government negotiators were quick to discern the makings of a deal on\nthis basis.\nDe Klerk was still a long way from accepting the idea of majority rule, even\nunder a government of national unity. His goal remained a constitution which\nwould ensure that blacks could not govern without the agreement of whites. But\nhis authority was steadily being eroded. In November , the Goldstone\nCommission uncovered a secret operation set up in  by the Department of\nMilitary Intelligence to run a dirty-tricks campaign against the ANC, using a\ncovert unit based in Pretoria which employed a network of \u2018prostitutes,\nhomosexuals, shebeen owners and drug dealers\u2019 to compromise ANC and\nUmkhonto leaders by involving them in criminal activity. The existence of the\nunit, run by the army\u2019s senior intelligence officer, provided the most damning\nevidence so far of a deliberate strategy at high government level to discredit the\nANC.\nA subsequent investigation carried out by the chief of defence force staff,\nGeneral Pierre Steyn, uncovered evidence of military intelligence involvement in\ntrain massacres, assassination, gun-running, smuggling and other criminal\nactivity. Unable to dismiss the problem any more as a \u2018few rogue individuals\u2019,\nde Klerk was forced to start cleaning up the military. He sacked or suspended\ntwenty-three officers, including two generals, and ordered a purge of military\n\n\fintelligence staff. Special force units like  Battalion and the police counterinsurgency unit, Koevoet, were disbanded. Military personnel and their\nassociates, de Klerk admitted, \u2018have been involved, and in some cases are still\ninvolved, in illegal and unauthorized activities and malpractices. There are\nindications that some of the activities and some of the individuals might have\nbeen motivated by a wish to prevent us from succeeding in our goals\u2019. The\noverall result was to tarnish de Klerk\u2019s reputation and to vindicate Mandela\u2019s\nclaims about the existence of a third force.\nBilateral meetings between the government and the ANC, starting in\nDecember  with a four-day bush summit or bosberaad held in a wildlife\nresort, now began to make steady progress. By February , the two sides\nwere agreed upon the outline for a new order, which meant de Klerk giving up\nmany of his original negotiating aims. The new order involved an interim fiveyear government of national unity in which all parties polling over  per cent\nwould be represented proportionately in the cabinet. After five years, the\ngovernment of national unity would become a simple majority-rule government.\nA transitional executive council, representing all parties accepting the process,\nwould oversee preparations for elections and would assure a \u2018level playing field\u2019\nfor all the contestants. During the five-year interim, an elected constituent\nassembly would draw up the final constitution but it would be based on a set of\nprinciples agreed to previously at multiparty negotiations which would launch\nthe whole process.\nThere were critics of this compromise arrangement on both sides, but the most\nextraordinary attack of all came from Winnie Mandela. Still awaiting the\noutcome of her appeal against convictions for kidnapping and assault, she was\nendeavouring to resurrect her political career by adopting hardline positions\npopular with militants. Her attack was launched not just against the negotiations\nprocess but against the role of the ANC\u2019s leaders and, by implication, Mandela\nhimself. The negotiations process, she said, was being conducted between \u2018the\nelite of the oppressed and the oppressors\u2019, ignoring the interests of the masses:\nThe NP elite is getting into bed with the ANC in order to preserve its silken\nsheets. And the leadership of the ANC is getting into bed with the NP to enjoy\nthis new-found luxury. The concern is that this new amalgam of power is\npromoting its own self-interest and overlooking the plight and needs of the\nunderprivileged masses. . . . The quick-fix solution sought by our leaders can\nonly benefit a few and will backfire massively on the country as a whole. The\n\n\fdisillusion that will follow when the masses awaken to the fact that they have not\nbeen included in the new freedom and in the new wealth enjoyed by their leaders\nwill have worse implications than what we experienced in the s and s,\nand will plunge the country irrevocably into yet another vortex of mass violence\nand protest.\nA new breed of leadership was needed, she said, truly representative of the\naspirations of the \u2018oppressed\u2019.\nWinnie\u2019s own lifestyle\u2014a grandiose mansion, an expensive wardrobe, a\nMercedes-Benz, a retinue of bodyguards and retainers\u2014was well known for its\nluxury and extravagance. Senior ANC officials dismissed her as no more than an\nopportunist. \u2018Who on earth is she to be speaking of silken sheets?\u2019 demanded\none official. Yet Winnie\u2019s remarks found a ready audience in the shack and\nsquatter settlements she patronised. And it was this mass of impoverished\npeople, she believed, who would carry her back to power within the ANC.\nIn April , multiparty negotiations resumed. No agreement on what the\nnew negotiating forum should be called had been reached, so it was given no\nformal name. The number of groups now represented had expanded from\nnineteen to twenty-six. This time, the Conservative Party was present, forsaking\nits vow never to sit down with \u2018terrorists\u2019. So was its offshoot, the Afrikaner\nVolksunie. The Pan-Africanist Congress also attended, even though it still\nprofessed to be committed to the armed struggle and had been involved in recent\nmurders of white farmers to prove it. Places had also been found for traditional\nleaders like the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelethini, whose presence had been\nrepeatedly demanded previously by Buthelezi. The participation of so many\nparties seemed to augur well.\nThen, within a matter of days, South Africa was struck by a cataclysmic event.\nOn the morning of Easter Saturday in April , as Chris Hani stepped out of\nhis car in the driveway of his home in Dawn Park, a predominantly white suburb\nof the gold-mining town of Boksburg on the East Rand, he was assassinated by a\nlone white gunman who had been waiting for him in a red Ford car parked\nacross the road. As the gunman drove off, an Afrikaner neighbour, who had\nheard the shots, memorised the registration number and phoned the police.\nFifteen minutes later, the gunman was arrested on a highway outside Boksburg.\nHani was a hero to millions of black youths, a legendary guerrilla commander\nwho had risen to become Umkhonto\u2019s chief of staff. A lifelong communist, he\n\n\fchampioned the cause of the poor and dispossessed. He was tough, ruthless and\nhugely popular, second only to Mandela, according to an independent poll in\nNovember . He was also famous for fiery speech-making. Yet, even though\nhe had misgivings, Hani had been converted to the cause of negotiation. When\nradical activists advocated a break with negotiations, Hani had argued\ndeterminedly in favour of pursuing them. He was pragmatic about the need to\noffer security forces an amnesty. When self-defence units in the townships began\ndegenerating into vigilante gangs, he had been the first to call for their\ndisbanding. He had moved to the white middle-class suburb of Dawn Park in\n in an attempt to break down racial barriers, influencing other black\npolitical and union officials to do the same. A few days before his death, he had\ndeclared, \u2018I am now a combatant for peace.\u2019 His following among the youth\nremained huge. If anyone was capable of mobilising this vast, unruly\nconstituency behind the negotiation process, it was Hani. His death at the hands\nof a white assassin seemed certain to plunge South Africa into an inferno of\nviolence.\nMandela was at his house in Qunu in the Transkei on that Easter Saturday,\nworking on his autobiography with the writer Richard Stengel. After an earlymorning walk in the countryside, Mandela had returned to the study to begin a\ntaped interview. He had hardly started when his housekeeper interrupted to let\nhim know that members of the Transkei police rugby team had arrived at the\nhouse and wanted to greet him. Mandela rose stiffly from his chair and went\noutside. While he was in the middle of shaking hands with each member of the\nteam in the driveway, the housekeeper ran out, in tears, telling him of an urgent\ntelephone call. Mandela excused himself and went inside to be told of Hani\u2019s\nassassination. \u2018Mandela put down the phone and looked off into the distance, his\nface drawn and concerned,\u2019 wrote Stengel, in his own account of the incident.\nHe then stood up, apologised to Stengel for the interruption and returned to the\ndriveway to finish shaking hands with the rugby players.\nWith remarkable speed, the leadership of the crisis was assumed not by the\ngovernment but by the ANC and Mandela. On radio and television throughout\nthe day, ANC officials appealed for peace. Mandela rushed back to\nJohannesburg in time to make a national address on television: \u2018With all the\nauthority at my command, I appeal to all our people to remain calm and to\nhonour the memory of Chris Hani by remaining a disciplined force for peace.\u2019\nThe circumstances around Hani\u2019s murder grew more ominous. The assassin,\n\n\fJanusw Waluz, a Polish immigrant who had lived in South Africa for twelve\nyears, was a member of the extremist Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging. The\nweapon he had used came from a batch of arms stolen from an air force armoury\nin  by a well-known Afrikaner extremist. One suspect arrested in\nconnection with the murder was a prominent member of the Conservative Party.\nThe possibility of a right-wing conspiracy to wreck the transition aggravated all\nthe tension.\nSeeking to harness the tide of outrage, the ANC announced a week-long\ncampaign of mass protest, including a national stayaway and memorial services.\nThe risks of violence breaking out from such action were only too well known.\nOn the eve of a day of mourning declared by the ANC, Mandela again addressed\nthe nation on radio and television, appealing for calm in broadcasts he repeated\nat  p.m.,  p.m. and  p.m.\nTonight, I am reaching out to every single South African, black and\nwhite, from the very depths of my being. A white man, full of prejudice\nand hate, came to our country and committed a deed so foul that our\nwhole nation now teeters on the brink of disaster. A white woman, of\nAfrikaner origin [Hani\u2019s neighbour], risked her life so that we may know,\nand bring to justice, this assassin. . . . Now is the time for all South\nAfricans to stand together against those who, from any quarter, wish to\ndestroy what Chris Hani gave his life for\u2014the freedom of all of us.\nHe called for discipline and dignified conduct: \u2018Chris Hani was a soldier. He\nbelieved in iron discipline. . . . Any lack of discipline is trampling on the values\nthat Chris Hani stood for. Those who commit such acts serve only the interests\nof the assassins.\u2019\nBy the standards to which South Africa had become accustomed, the events in\nthe days following Hani\u2019s assassination were relatively orderly. In nearly every\nurban area, chanting crowds swept through city centres; in several they left\nstreets in chaos, with burnt cars and smashed and looted shops. But mostly the\ndemonstrators heeded Mandela\u2019s call for discipline. Some  million workers\nparticipated in the stayaway, again in relative calm. But the sheer size and\nintensity of feeling of the protests were something white authority had never\nbefore experienced.\nRadical factions were active in clamouring for revenge. At a protest rally at a\nsquatter settlement in Cape Town, organised by the ANC\u2019s youth leader Peter\n\n\fMokaba and by Winnie Mandela, Mokaba was captured on television chanting,\n\u2018Kill the Boer! Kill the farmers!\u2019 Winnie followed by calling on the ANC\u2019s\nyouth to oust the ANC\u2019s leadership and take the streets by storm. At a memorial\nservice in Soweto, when Mandela referred to a message of sympathy from the\nNational Party, he was jeered. Demonstrators were not just angry about Hani\u2019s\nmurder but impatient at the failure of the negotiation process to deliver concrete\nresults. \u2018Mandela released three years ago: South Africa still not free,\u2019 read one\nplacard at Hani\u2019s funeral.\nThe significance of these events, however, went far beyond the question of\nviolence. It was the time when Mandela emerged as a national leader,\ncomprehending at once the magnitude of the crisis, seeking to calm white fears\nas well as black anger, demanding discipline and receiving it. De Klerk and his\ngovernment, meanwhile, were hardly to be seen. From his Cape holiday home,\nde Klerk issued statements, clearly partisan in nature, aimed at white\nconstituents alarmed by the violence. His preoccupation, as one Johannesburg\nnewspaper noted, was \u2018to assure whites that they were safe from the black\nhordes\u2019.\nIn the long struggle between Mandela and de Klerk, no other single event\nprovoked such a dramatic shift in the balance of power, nor revealed so clearly\nto the white community how important Mandela was to their future security.\n THE LONELIEST MAN\nTWO WEEKS AFTER HANI\u2019S ASSASSINATION, OLIVER TAMBO\nSUDDENLY died after suffering a second stroke. Though his first stroke had\nleft him partly immobilised on his right side, he had remained active as the\nANC\u2019s national chairman, working three days a week at the party headquarters\nin central Johannesburg, right up to the day of his death. He was widely revered\nfor his soft-spoken, lucid manner, always seeking compromise and consensus.\nWhile Mandela inspired admiration, even awe, Tambo inspired love.\nTambo\u2019s death was a colossal blow to Mandela. The trio of Mandela, Sisulu\nand Tambo had sustained the African nationalist struggle for fifty years.\nTambo\u2019s friendship, like Sisulu\u2019s, had spanned Mandela\u2019s entire adult life,\nstarting from their days together at Fort Hare, through the Youth League, their\nlaw partnership and the Defiance Campaign, to the treason trial and the\nformation of Umkhonto we Sizwe. Even during his years in prison, Mandela said\nin his autobiography, Tambo was never far from his thoughts: \u2018Though we were\nseparated, I kept up a lifelong conversation with him in my head.\u2019 On the day of\nhis release from prison in , Mandela described as \u2018the most wonderful\nmoment\u2019 the occasion late at night when a telephone call came through from\nTambo in Sweden, where he was recuperating from his first stroke. Their\nreunion in Stockholm later in the year was joyous. \u2018When we met we were like\ntwo young boys in the veld who took strength from our love for each other,\u2019\nMandela wrote. On the day of Tambo\u2019s death, Mandela spoke to journalists. \u2018I\nwill feel his loss in a unique manner,\u2019 he said. \u2018We are bleeding from the\ninvisible wounds that are so difficult to heal.\u2019 To a friend, he remarked that he\nfelt like the loneliest man in the world.\nHis home life compounded the sense of loneliness he felt. Separated from\nWinnie, he lived alone in his six-bedroom house in Houghton, frequently with\nonly bodyguards and servants for company. When Zindzi paid him visits, she\nwould often find him on his own, eating supper at the large dining-room table by\nhimself.\n\n\fIn private, with his own children, he remained a stern figure. Zindzi, who\nknew little of him until his release in , noted how he avoided bodily contact.\n\u2018He\u2019ll only hold your hand for a moment,\u2019 she said. In a magazine interview, she\ndescribed Mandela as \u2018a typical African father\u2019, demanding strict obedience. \u2018He\nthinks very traditionally,\u2019 she said. \u2018He is head of the family. . . . His will is law.\u2019\nWith his son, Makgatho, Mandela still insisted he should pursue his studies.\nAll his affection he concentrated on his grandchildren. He developed a special\nbond with one of Zindzi\u2019s sons, Bambatha, whose father, Sizwe Sithole, had\nhanged himself in a police cell shortly before Mandela\u2019s release. Bambatha was\nonly three months old at the time. For two years, while Zindzi lived with her\nparents in Soweto, Mandela was able to spend much time with Bambatha. He\nenjoyed putting him to bed at night. \u2018He even got up in the middle of the night to\nchange his nappy and give him his bottle, as if Bambatha were his own son,\u2019\nZindzi recalled. But with older grandchildren, Mandela could be as stern and\ndemanding as he was with his own children.\nIn the company of friends, he found it difficult to relax. His circle of friends\nwas wide and varied, but there were few with whom he was on intimate terms.\nWith the death of Oliver Tambo, only Walter Sisulu survived of the group of\nyoung firebrands from the s who had played such a central role in his early\nlife. To Sisulu, Mandela remained as he had always been: warm, kind and\nsociable. \u2018That type of a nature doesn\u2019t really change,\u2019 mused Sisulu, after fifty\nyears of friendship. Other old friends included Yusuf Cachalia and his wife,\nAmina, a strikingly attractive woman for whom Mandela had a particular\naffection. Mandela and Cachalia had once cooked a pigeon pie to celebrate\nAmina\u2019s twenty-first birthday and she reminded him of the occasion in a letter\nsent to him on Robben Island. Mandela replied, \u2018My dear Amina, How dare you\ntorture me by reminding me of that pigeon meal!\u2019 He wrote too of his lasting\nfriendship with the Cachalias, citing \u2018the powerful links that hold us tightly\ntogether\u2019. When Amina first saw him in Pollsmoor, after twenty-four years, she\nwas shocked by his thin and emaciated appearance. She noticed that he had\nbecome quieter, more gentle, more measured. She realised too the huge\nadjustments he faced upon his release from prison: \u2018He had a lot to learn, a\nwhole new lifestyle.\u2019\nBut outside a handful of close friends, Mandela kept his distance. The\naloofness that he had shown before his imprisonment had hardened during the\nlong years he spent there. He evaded intimacy. Even friends like Kathy\n\n\fKathrada, who had known him on close terms for so many years in prison, still\nfound him to be \u2018a very cool person\u2014self-contained to an exceptional degree\u2019.\nNot once during their prison life did Kathrada ever hear Mandela proclaim any\npersonal ambition. \u2018If he had any inner feelings about what he wanted to be, it\nwas never evident,\u2019 said Kathrada. \u2018In prison we never ever talked even lightly\nabout his being president of the country.\u2019 As one of Mandela\u2019s key aides upon\nhis release from prison, Kathrada still found it difficult to tell what went on in\nhis mind. \u2018Take the latest incident involving Winnie, \u2019 he said. \u2018When I would\nmeet him for work or casually, you would never decipher in his attitude towards\nus what was going on in his mind about this matter. He would not even mention\nit.\u2019\nMandela was often most at ease in dealing with strangers or ac - quaintances.\nHe remained courteous and attentive to individuals, whatever their status or their\nage. His aides sometimes had to chastise him from rising from his chair to greet\neveryone who approached. Soon after his release from prison, when he attended\na friend\u2019s birthday party in an affluent white suburb of Johannesburg, he spent\nmost of the evening greeting a constant stream of maids, gardeners and domestic\nstaff from the neighbourhood who came to see him, shaking each one by the\nhand and conversing at length with all of them. At luncheons and banquets, he\nalways made a point of shaking hands with the staff, showing the same courtesy\nto them that he would to dignitaries.\nHe was also attracted to people of wealth and fame. Among his many\nacquaintances were millionaires only too willing to ingratiate themselves. The\ninsurance magnate Douw Steyn lent him a home after he left Winnie. The casino\ntycoon Sol Kerzner helped pay for Zindzi\u2019s extravagant wedding and provided a\nhoneymoon suite at one of his hotels in Mauritius. He dined regularly with the\nOppenheimers and spent holidays with the Menells, another prominent mining\nfamily. Mandela might mock his relations with the rich and famous\u2014at the end\nof one of his sessions with Richard Stengel, he remarked, \u2018I am having lunch\ntoday with the third richest family in South Africa; I will not starve\u2019\u2014but he\noften seemed to prefer their company. When he approached twenty leading\nbusinessmen for at least  million rands each to help him with election expenses,\nall but one complied.\nIn the absence of any real family life, all Mandela\u2019s efforts were concentrated\non political work. His daily schedule, for a man of seventy-four, was punishing.\nHe still arose at about  a.m. for his exercises. When he first arrived in\n\n\fHoughton, he enjoyed an early-morning jog through its leafy streets, but after the\nassassination of Chris Hani he confined himself to exercising at home. By  a.m.\nhe was at work in his tenth-floor office in ANC headquarters at Shell House in\ncentral Johannesburg. The rest of the day was filled with meetings, interviews,\nspeeches, negotiations, conferences, working lunches, fund-raising appearances\nand banquets. He liked to be back home by . p.m. to catch up on his reading.\nHis foreign trips were as numerous as before.\nWith increasing frequency, Mandela suffered from bouts of exhaustion. His\ndoctors pointed out that what was remarkable, in view of his schedule, was not\nthat he was so tired but that he remained so energetic. Dr Louis Gecelter, who\nexamined him regularly, concluded that Mandela possessed the mental and\nphysical attributes of a man of fifty. The explanation, he said, lay partly in the\ndietary discipline and exercise routine of twenty-seven years in prison. But it\nwas also because Mandela was a man for whom life was only just beginning, for\nwhom the important goals in life still lay ahead.\nWithin the ANC, Mandela played an elevated role, largely removed from\nadministrative concerns, internal squabbles and the hard grind of negotiations.\nHe usually left detail in the hands of officials like Ramaphosa. He was\nrecognised as being the ANC\u2019s greatest asset, its elder statesman, able to achieve\nfor the ANC a degree of international respectability and support that would\notherwise be missing. But he was not always sure-footed. His pronouncements,\nnotably on foreign affairs, sometimes left ANC officials aghast. During a\ntelephone conversation with President George Bush, he lectured him on the\nperils of US policy towards the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein. He also\ninfuriated the Bush administration by taking Colonel Gaddafi\u2019s side in the feud\nover the bombing of Pan Am flight . He heaped praise on Cuba as an\n\u2018inspiration to all freedom-loving people\u2019. On British television, he spoke of his\nsupport for the IRA\u2019s \u2018struggle against colonialism\u2019. At home, his suggestion\nthat the franchise should be extended to fourteen-year-old children became a\nnational joke.\nThe one subject Mandela would not discuss was Winnie; about her, he\nmaintained a stony silence. In June , two years after her conviction for\nkidnapping and assault, the verdict on her appeal was finally handed down by\nthe chief justice, Michael Corbett. In reaching its decision, the Appeal Court\nheard no new evidence. The allegations made by Xoliswa Falati, John Morgan\nand others while the appeal process was under way were not part of the Appeal\n\n\fCourt\u2019s purview. All that the Appeal Court was concerned with was evidence\ngiven during the original trial.\nJustice Corbett ruled that there was no doubt that Stompie Moe - ketsi Seipei\nand three other young men had been kidnapped and assaulted in Mrs Mandela\u2019s\nhome in December . He found that the trial judge had been correct in\nfinding Winnie guilty of kidnapping them. But he accepted Winnie\u2019s claim that\nshe had been far from home during the beatings and consequently found her not\nguilty of being an accessory to the assaults. He reduced her six-year sentence to\na two-year suspended sentence, and ordered her to pay a fine of , rands\nand compensation of , rands to each of the surviving kidnap victims. With\nthe threat of a prison sentence now lifted, Winnie was free to pursue her own\npolitical ambitions. Falati, however, lost her appeal and was ordered to serve two\nyears in prison.\nMandela\u2019s comment on the outcome was terse: \u2018I am very happy my\nestranged wife will not have to go to jail,\u2019 he said. A few weeks later, he made\nhis own gesture of contrition to Stompie\u2019s mother when, during a political rally\nat her home town of Parys, he insisted she be given a place of honour on the\npodium and spoke to her at length, pointedly, for all to see.\nOn  July , at a party to celebrate Mandela\u2019s seventy-fifth birthday,\nsome  guests were invited, but Winnie was not one of them.\n\nIn the wake of Hani\u2019s assassination, Mandela was able to force the pace of\nnegotiations, insisting on swift, tangible progress. On  June , negotiators at\nthe multiparty forum at the World Trade Centre outside Johannesburg voted to\nset a date for the first democratic election\u2014 April \u2014even though\nagreement on an interim constitution was nowhere near being in sight.\nAs the spectre of majority rule moved closer, a motley collection of the\nANC\u2019s opponents\u2014homeland leaders and extreme rightwing groups\u2014banded\ntogether to thwart the process. The central figure was Buthelezi. Though Inkatha\nhad rejoined the multiparty forum in April , Buthelezi produced proposals\nof his own for an autonomous region for KwaZulu-Natal and threatened a \u2018go-italone\u2019 approach if a referendum in the territory approved the plan. Buthelezi\u2019s\nproposals not only reduced the functions of central government to a minimum,\nthey concentrated enormous power in the hands of the rulers of KwaZulu-Natal,\n\n\fwith few checks and balances. The case for a federal South Africa was eminently\nrespectable; it would have suited several minority groups. But Buthelezi,\ninfluenced heavily by white advisers, presented his plan on an all-or-nothing\nbasis, believing that he was too important for the process to continue without\nhim. Even his negotiators conceded that Buthelezi\u2019s ego was a significant part of\nthe problem. Buthelezi also objected to the two-stage approach of the drafting of\nthe final constitution, insisting that the full text should be drawn up by the\npresent negotiators before an election rather than by an elected constitutionmaking body in the future. In protest against the setting of the April  date\nfor the elections, Buthelezi withdrew Inkatha from the negotiations process,\nclearly expecting it to founder in the same way as it had done the previous year\nwhen the ANC walked out of Codesa.\nButhelezi found common cause with two other homeland leaders, Lucas\nMangope, the autocratic ruler of Bophuthatswana, and Brigadier Gqozo, the\nmilitary dictator of Ciskei. Both hoped to be able to secure a future for\nthemselves in the kind of federal system proposed by Buthelezi. Mangope had\nbeen an ideal partner in the apartheid system and benefited from it substantially.\nLike Buthelezi, he ran a tight one-party system, with control of parliament, radio\nand television, and brooked no opposition. At a recent election in October ,\nall his own candidates had been returned\u2014unopposed. Opinion polls suggested\nthat Mangope possessed minimal public support\u2014less than  per cent\u2014far less\nthan Buthelezi\u2019s following, but this had never troubled him. As far as apartheid\u2019s\nrulers were concerned, Mangope had been far more reliable, more predictable,\nthan Buthelezi. Whereas Buthelezi had refused \u2018independence\u2019, Mangope had\ntaken it. When Mangope was threatened by a military coup in , the South\nAfricans had duly come to the rescue. \u2018Oh! I never knew how friends could be\nso loyal!\u2019 Mangope told the white minister who arrived on the scene to help him.\nDespite Mangope\u2019s evident lack of popularity, de Klerk had always considered\nhim a potential ally for the National Party in an anti-ANC coalition. Like\nBrigadier Gqozo in Ciskei, he had refused to allow the ANC to conduct any\npolitical activity in his territory.\nMandela had by now lost all patience with Buthelezi. \u2018He reached a point\nwhere he was very, very angry,\u2019 Sisulu recalled. \u2018In fact, so angry that when the\nwhole executive took a lighter line, saying that Buthelezi should be spoken to, he\nsaid no.\u2019 Senior ANC officials, examining Buthelezi\u2019s constitutional proposals,\nwere convinced that his real objective was secession from South Africa\n\n\faltogether. They argued that no matter what concessions Buthelezi was offered,\nhe would still continue to boycott the transition process because he feared the\nconsequences of an election. They also took the view that though Buthelezi\u2019s\nparticipation in the election was preferable, to ensure a wider legitimacy, it was\nnot essential. He could therefore be ignored. A hardcore of militants, led by\nHarry Gwala, still advocated using force to oust both him and his allies.\nIn his dealings with Mangope, Mandela found him to be equally obdurate. He\ntravelled to Mangope\u2019s capital, Mmabatho, near the Botswanan border, to see if\nthey could come to terms, suggesting that they both address a rally in\nBophuthatswana to make clear their commitment to a peaceful resolution.\nMangope at first agreed, but then changed his mind. \u2018The discussions broke\ndown,\u2019 said Mandela. \u2018I have phoned him since on numerous occasions and he\nhas avoided me.\u2019 As with Buthelezi and Gqozo, Mandela believed that Mangope\nposed no serious threat to the transition process.\nThe real threat, as Mandela and others in the ANC saw it, came from extreme\nrightwing organisations. On their own, they were known more for weekend\nparades and for fierce rhetoric than for action. They were divided into a host of\nsplinter groups, constantly squabbling with each other. But what worried\nMandela was the extent of support they had from within the security forces and\nfrom army and police reserve units stationed across the country. \u2018The ultra-right\nis powerful in the proper sense of the word,\u2019 said Mandela. Their support within\nthe public service, the army, the police and other strategic institutions was\nsignificant: \u2018They are trained and experienced and they know the country better\nthan we do. . . . They can derail any democratic government in this country.\u2019\nThe common aim of many extreme rightwing groups was to establish an\nAfrikaner homeland, a volkstaat. At the entrance to many platteland towns, road\nsigns decorated with the flags of the old Boer republics already declared their\nallegiance. Demands for a volkstaat were frequently accompanied by threats of\nviolence. \u2018Mandela, give us a volkstaat or you\u2019ll have total war in South Africa,\u2019\nthe AWB leader, Eugene Terre\u2019Blanche, told supporters at Lichtenburg. A spate\nof bomb explosions on railway tracks, power pylons and ANC property in the\nTransvaal and the Orange Free State underlined the message.\nYet after nearly four years of talks about a volkstaat, far-right parties still\nfailed to make clear where it would be located or how it would work. No\nexplanation was forthcoming about the rights of non-Afrikaners living in an area\n\n\fdeclared a volkstaat, or how their opinions would be taken into account. De\nKlerk described the idea as \u2018a hopeless illusion\u2019.\nIn May , in an attempt to present a united demand for a volkstaat, a\n\u2018committee of generals\u2019, consisting of retired army and police commanders from\nthe \u2018total strategy\u2019 era, formed an Afrikaner Volksfront, an umbrella group\nbringing together twenty-one organisations including the Conservative Party, the\nneo-Nazi AWB, the Transvaal Municipal Associations, white trade unions and\nfarmers\u2019 unions from the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. The AVF\u2019s\nleader, General Constand Viljoen, a former chief of the defence staff, hoped to\nprovide the right wing with a more pragmatic leadership. His own experience of\nwarfare in Angola, Mozambique and Namibia had led him to conclude that\nviolence was the worst possible option. He also wanted to establish a respectable\nimage for the AVF. But he had to contend with the inane antics of the AWB.\nOn  June, at a demonstration organised by the AVF outside the World\nTrade Centre, intended to promote its demand for a volkstaat, a group of AWB\nsupporters led by Terre\u2019Blanche, brandishing shotguns and revolvers, broke\nthrough a police cordon, drove an armoured security vehicle through the glass\nfront of the building and stormed into the conference chamber, screaming abuse\nand assaulting delegates, officials and journalists along the way. They then\noccupied delegates\u2019 seats, scrawled slogans on walls and urinated on the floor.\nViljoen\u2019s efforts to restrain the mob were ignored.\nDespite such acts of hooliganism and violence, Mandela was determined to\nseek a dialogue with the far right to avert what he feared might become a\nconcerted effort to sabotage the transition to majority rule. In August, at a secret\nmeeting in a private house in Houghton, Mandela met three of the AVF\u2019s\ngenerals, including Viljoen. He was blunt in presenting his appraisal of the\nsituation:\nIf you want to go to war, I must be honest and admit that we cannot stand up to\nyou on the battlefield. We don\u2019t have the resources. It will be a long and bitter\nstruggle, many people will die and the country may be reduced to ashes. But you\nmust remember two things. You cannot win because of our numbers: you cannot\nkill us all. And you cannot win because of the international community. They\nwill rally to our support and they will stand with us.\nThe meeting achieved an unexpected result. Mandela believed, just as much\nas de Klerk, that the idea of a volkstaat was a hopeless illusion. His aim was to\n\n\fengage the AVF in talks for as long as possible in the hope that rightwing fears\nabout their future security under majority rule might in time begin to diminish.\nHe found the generals amenable to further talks. A committee of ANC officials\nwas set up to meet the AVF generals on a regular basis. What was unexpected\nwas that Mandela and Viljoen developed an immediate liking for each other.\nMandela felt a genuine sympathy for Viljoen\u2019s concerns about Afrikaner culture,\nreligion and language, which were in marked contrast to de Klerk\u2019s\npreoccupations with pensions and privileges. The degree of trust that Mandela\nand Viljoen shared from their first meeting was to have important consequences\nin crises that lay ahead.\nMeanwhile, negotiators at the World Trade Centre ploughed on, doggedly\nassembling a new constitution. The most contentious issue was federalism\u2014the\nbalance of power between central government and the provinces. The ANC\nwanted a strong central government with powers to override the provinces. The\nNational Party advocated a measure of devolution, but made only a half-hearted\neffort to fight for it. The liberal opposition Democratic Party favoured\ndevolution, but possessed too little weight in the negotiations process to secure\nit. Buthelezi was the most insistent on the need for maximum devolution, but he\nthrew away what chances there were of obtaining greater federal powers by\nchoosing to boycott the negotiations. Consequently, the first drafts of the new\nconstitution to emerge from the World Trade Centre in July and August\ncontained only minor elements of federalism.\nButhelezi denounced the result and, with a warning of civil war \u2018or worse\u2019,\nthreatened to boycott the  elections unless his demands for autonomy were\nmet. Rightwing parties took the same line. The Conservative Party described the\ndraft constitution as \u2018hostile to Afrikaner interests\u2019 and \u2018a recipe for civil war,\nfurther economic deterioration and a spiral of violence\u2019. Its new leader, Ferdi\nHartzenberg, said the Conservative Party would participate in further talks only\nwhen Afrikaner self-determination was \u2018unequivocally accepted\u2019.\nA new alliance of opposition groups was launched to fight for a federal or\nconfederal state. Called the Freedom Alliance, it consisted of Buthelezi from\nKwaZulu, Mangope from Bophuthatswana, Gqozo from Ciskei, Hartzenberg\nfrom the Conservative Party and General Viljoen from the Afrikaner Volksfront\n\u2014a motley crew, but one that possessed a high potential for disruption.\nOn the Witwatersrand, the Reef war burst out with renewed ferocity.\n\n\fTownships on the East Rand such as Thokoza and Katlehong became war zones,\ntheir streets lined with deserted, burnt-out houses, wrecked vehicles, barricades\nand boulders, as Inkatha hostel dwellers and ANC comrades fought for territorial\npossession. Many hostel dwellers found themselves virtually under armed siege;\nfood and other supplies had to be delivered under paramilitary police protection.\nHit-and-run raids continued relentlessly. In the first ten months of , some\n, people died in political violence in the East Rand townships. Similar strife,\nthough on an even greater scale, occurred in the killing fields of Natal.\nMandela, now that he was close to inheriting the problem of township\nviolence, no longer saw fit to blame it solely on de Klerk. He still castigated the\ngovernment for its failure to deal effectively with the violence, but accepted that\nthe ANC had an equal responsibility for trying to bring it to an end. However,\nthe message of peace and reconciliation he tried to convey was often drowned\nout.\nArriving in Katlehong to address a rally at a football stadium, Mandela found\na message awaiting him, scribbled on the table next to his microphone. It read,\n\u2018No peace. Do not talk about peace. We\u2019ve had enough. Please, Mr Mandela, no\npeace. Give us weapons. No peace.\u2019\nAfter criticising the government, Mandela scolded his own supporters,\nundeterred by the angry murmuring in the crowd of some , people: \u2018There\nare times now when our people participate in the killing of innocent people. It is\ndifficult for us to say when people are angry that they must be nonviolent. . . But\nthe solution is peace; it is reconciliation; it is political tolerance.\u2019\nSome in the crowd jeered, but Mandela continued:\nWe must accept blacks are fighting each other in our townships. So the task of\nthe ANC is to unite black people as well. . . . We must accept that responsibility\nfor ending violence is not just the government\u2019s, the police\u2019s, the army\u2019s. It is\nalso our responsibility. . . . We should put our own house in order. If you have\nno discipline, you are not freedom fighters. If you are going to kill innocent\npeople, you don\u2019t belong to the ANC. Your task is reconciliation. You must go\nto your area and ask a member of Inkatha: why are we fighting?\nThe crowd shouted back. \u2018Listen to me! Listen to me!\u2019 he cried above the din.\n\u2018I am your leader. As long as I am your leader, I am going to give leadership. Do\nyou want me to remain your leader?\u2019 Chastened, the crowd roared back, \u2018Yes!\u2019\nMandela went on, \u2018Well, as long as I am your leader, I will tell you, always,\n\n\fwhen you are wrong. \u2018\nBack at the World Trade Centre, after seven months of haggling, drafting and\nredrafting, deadlocks and deadlines, negotiators struggled through to the last\nremaining points of dispute. The most difficult of all\u2014how cabinet decisions\nwere to be taken in the government of national unity\u2014had deliberately been left\nto the end. De Klerk insisted that cabinet decisions should require a two-thirds\nmajority, potentially a means of minority veto. The ANC\u2019s negotiators wanted\nan ordinary majority, but were privately prepared to agree to a  per cent\nmajority if necessary to break the deadlock. Hours before the final plenary\nsession was due to sit on  November, the issue still had not been resolved.\nIn a final encounter late at night on  November, Mandela and de Klerk\nconfronted each other over the last remaining clause. Mandela was adamant. The\nmajority in cabinet would decide, he said; he could not run a cabinet in any other\nway. There would be no minority veto. Power would be shared voluntarily or not\nat all.\nAs the remains of his power drained away, de Klerk surrendered even on this\npoint. All that he managed to salvage was an agreement that the cabinet would\nfunction in accordance with a \u2018consensus-seeking spirit\u2019. At the very last minute,\nde Klerk had been obliged to accept majority rule.\nIn the early hours of  November, the interim constitution was approved by\nthe plenary session, signalling the end of  years of white rule that had begun\nwhen the Dutchman Jan van Riebeeck first set foot on the Cape of Good Hope in\n. Mandela used the occasion to urge South Africans \u2018to join hands and\nmarch into the future\u2019.\nAfter such a marathon endeavour, there was a sense of euphoria about the\noutcome. The scent of power was particularly heady for the ANC. Its chief\nnegotiator, Cyril Ramaphosa, crowed about how the National Party\u2019s negotiating\nposition at the last hour had \u2018collapsed\u2019. Joe Slovo, writing in the African\nCommunist, proclaimed \u2018a famous victory\u2019, adding, \u2018We got pretty much what\nwe wanted.\u2019 Widespread protests at the way the ANC had blocked the use of a\ndouble ballot paper for the election of national and provincial legislatures, which\nwould have enhanced the chances of smaller regionally based parties, were\ndismissed with contempt. The issue, said the ANC, was not negotiable. There\nwould be no further concessions made to demands for greater regional powers.\nRamaphosa curtly rejected proposals that the name of Kwa Zulu should be\n\n\fretained by incorporating it into a province renamed KwaZulu-Natal. The name\nKwaZulu, he said, was a creation of apartheid and would not feature on maps of\npost-apartheid South Africa. The province would be known henceforth simply as\nNatal. At early meetings of the transitional executive council, the ANC was\nquick to start throwing its weight about. Any sign of trouble from the provinces,\na senior ANC official warned, and they would \u2018let the tanks roll in\u2019. As the ANC\ncelebrated its triumph, whatever prospects there were of broadening the\nsettlement to include Inkatha and other members of the Freedom Alliance\nrapidly degenerated, pushing South Africa towards civil war.\n\nWhat had been achieved, nevertheless, was remarkable. Four years previously,\nSouth Africa had been in the hands of a ruthless, authoritarian government,\ndetermined to protect white power and privilege, buttressed by formidable\nsecurity forces and a vast administrative apparatus, and with access to huge state\nrevenues. De Klerk had embarked upon his reforms assuming that his\ngovernment enjoyed such a preponderance of power that it could set the terms of\nany settlement. He scorned all notion of majority rule, holding firm to the need\nfor group rights. Indeed, even after the new constitutional agreement was\nreached, he still argued that separate development for different ethnic groups as\na constitutional option was morally justified. What de Klerk expected to emerge\nfrom the negotiations process was a government coalition of moderate parties\nwhich the National Party would dominate.\nYet stage by stage, he had been forced into compromise. From group rights he\nhad moved on to the idea of power-sharing through a permanently enforced\ncoalition, repeatedly insisting that he would never surrender to \u2018simple majority\nrule\u2019. Whatever the outcome of a popular vote, he said, he would demand a\nguaranteed share in power and he would hold out as long as necessary to obtain\none. At the very least there would have to be a white veto in cabinet.\nThe compromises that de Klerk had been induced to accept came about in part\nthrough skilful negotiation, in part by force of circumstance, like the Hani\nassassination, which led to de Klerk\u2019s irreversible commitment to an election\ndate. But they also reflected changes in the government\u2019s thinking about white\ninterests and ways of protecting them. Apartheid had brought the whites\nunprecedented prosperity. For much of the white community, prosperity rather\nthan power had become their preoccupation. Like other white communities in\n\n\fAfrica, they had come to accept the old adage: give them parliament and keep\nthe banks. As Joe Slovo had foreseen when putting forward his \u2018sunset clause\u2019,\nguarantees about employment, pensions and property were sufficient to break\nthe log jam in negotiations. But what de Klerk also came to realise was that the\nindispensable role played by whites in the civil service, the security forces and\nthe economy would give them far greater leverage over a new government than\nmere constitutional clauses. Even when making his last stand against Mandela\nover the issue of the cabinet veto, de Klerk acknowledged that a voluntary\nagreement on the need for \u2018consensus-seeking\u2019 was likely to give the whites\nmore influence in cabinet than an entrenched clause in the constitution which an\nANC majority would seek to thwart.\nUnderpinning the settlement was the extraordinary stature that Mandela had\nattained in the four years since his release from prison. His exemplary lack of\nbitterness, his insistence on national recon - ciliation and his willingness to\ncompromise had earned him enduring respect among his white adversaries. The\nwhite community would not vote for him, but they would accept a government\nunder his presidency.\nOn a personal basis, the relationship between Mandela and de Klerk never\nrecovered from the long war of attrition they had fought. In public and private,\ntheir dealings over who was to blame for the violence remained abrasive.\nMandela was infuriated by what he claimed was de Klerk\u2019s indifference to the\nloss of black lives. He was also irked by de Klerk\u2019s refusal to condemn the\nprinciple of apartheid. While de Klerk was willing to admit that the apartheid\nsystem had led to injustice and hardship, for which he apologised, he still\ncontinued to speak approvingly of the idea of ethnic separation, provided it was\nvoluntary.\nEven on the occasion when the two men were jointly awarded the Nobel\nPeace Prize in Oslo in December , the friction was still evident. In\ninterviews, Mandela spoke of his \u2018disappointment\u2019 with de Klerk\u2019s conduct in\nthe negotiations and once more accused the government of involvement in\ntownship violence. De Klerk, for his part, appeared to resent being upstaged by\nMandela, believing that his own efforts had been overlooked. In choosing them\nas \u2018Men of the Year\u2019 for , Time magazine noted that \u2018the mutual bitterness\nand resentments between de Klerk and Mandela are palpable\u2019, and it asked\nrhetorically, \u2018How could these two have agreed on anything\u2014lunch, for\ninstance, much less the remaking of a nation?\u2019\n\n\fAt a political level, however, Mandela recognised how important de Klerk\nwas to the whole settlement. \u2018My worst nightmare is that I wake up and de Klerk\nisn\u2019t there,\u2019 Mandela told guests at a private dinner party. \u2018I need him. Whether I\nlike him or not is irrelevant. I need him.\u2019 THE ELECTION ROLLER-COASTER\nIN THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN, MANDELA WAS THE STAR\nATTRACTION. Everywhere he went, from one township to another, from one\nstadium to the next, he was greeted by huge exuberant crowds eager to catch a\nglimpse of him. For many, he was a messianic figure bringing them the promise\nof freedom. Long before the election took place, he was regarded as the victor.\nSeeing Mandela was an event in itself. He made the most of his appearances,\nstanding in open vehicles, smiling and waving in obvious pleasure, punching his\nfist in the air, ignoring the concerns of his bodyguards in order to stretch out and\nshake hands, while cheerful pandemonium erupted all around.\nHe proved to be a natural campaigner, as much at ease with crowds as with\nsmall gatherings and bystanders, tailoring his speeches and his attire for each\naudience. For white businessmen, he chose elegant striped suits; for the\ntownships, flamboyant shirts. Appearing at a mineworkers\u2019 meeting in a suit, he\napologised, saying that he had not had time to change into something more\ncasual, then delighted his audience by donning a miner\u2019s helmet. Colourful silk\nshirts, buttoned at the neck, soon became his trademark. When a child asked him\nwhy he wore them, he replied: \u2018You must remember I was in jail for twentyseven years. I want to feel freedom.\u2019\nThe manifesto he launched in January  was thick with promises. Using\nthe slogan \u2018A better life for all\u2019, Mandela undertook to introduce what he\ndescribed as a \u2018gigantic\u2019 programme of public works, providing houses, essential\nservices, electrification, better schools, roads, clinics and formal employment for\nmillions of people. The specific targets laid out in the manifesto were ambitious:\njobs and training for . million people over ten years;  million houses to be\nbuilt over five years; electrification for . million rural and urban homes;\nrunning water and flush lavatories for over  million families over five years; ten\nyears of free and compulsory education for all children; free school textbooks to\nbe doubled in number within one year; affordable access to telecommunications;\nand basic health care for all. Other items included land reform, affirmative action\n\n\fprogrammes, small business development, lower food taxes and income tax\nreductions for low-paid workers.\nNo explanation was forthcoming in the manifesto about how all these\nundertakings would be financed. Like the Freedom Charter of , the\nmanifesto contained a large number of utopian notions. The objectives\nthemselves were laudable enough, but amounted to little more than a wish list.\nAs well as the manifesto, the ANC produced a \u2018reconstruction and\ndevelopment programme\u2019 in an endeavour to provide a policy framework for the\nfuture. But its list of promises and moral imperatives was even longer than that\ncontained in the manifesto and included everything from paid maternity leave to\na reduction in traffic accidents. Once again, no costs were given, no suggestion\nof a funding strategy was made, no priorities were set and policy options were\nleft wide open.\nFinding an agreed economic policy proved to be a difficult business for the\nANC. It re-emerged in South Africa in , a revolutionary organisation laden\nwith a great deal of ideological baggage, proclaiming the virtues of socialism\nand state control despite the collapse of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe. The\nFreedom Charter, with its commitment to nationalisation of the banks and\n\u2018monopoly\u2019 industry, was regarded as sacrosanct. When Mandela first came out\nof prison in , he was asked whether he had changed his view in any way\nabout the need for a radical redistribution of wealth in South Africa. \u2018No,\u2019 he\nreplied, without a moment\u2019s hesitation. \u2018My views are identical to those of the\nANC. The question of the nationalisation of the mines and similar important\nsectors of the community is a fundamental policy of the ANC and I believe that\nthe ANC is quite correct in this attitude. \u2019 His remarks caused a wave of panic\namong businessmen and sent share prices on the Johannesburg stock exchange\nplummeting.\nUnder pressure from the business community, foreign investors and\ninternational financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the\nWorld Bank, the ANC modified its views but still held firm to the ideals of the\nFreedom Charter. Time and again, Mandela spoke of the need for a\nredistribution of wealth and property. Addressing a panel at the World Economic\nForum in Davos, Switzerland, in , Mandela declared, \u2018Taking some key\nenterprises into public ownership will itself be a major step towards overcoming\nthe huge inequality in the ownership of our country\u2019s wealth.\u2019 He was mortified\n\n\fto find, however, that both de Klerk and Buthelezi, addressing the same meeting\nbut promising a vigorous free-enterprise system, were given a far more\nenthusiastic reception from the world\u2019s top businessmen.\nYet Mandela\u2019s subsequent efforts to shift the direction of ANC policy\nencountered strong resistance. At an ANC economic policy conference in ,\nheld after the Davos meeting, when Mandela warned that the ANC would\nalienate the business community worldwide if it persisted with its nationalisation\nprogramme, Ben Turok, the Marxist economist who had helped draft the\nFreedom Charter\u2019s economic clause nearly forty years before, rose to ask how\nMandela could now turn his back on the Charter. Facing outright opposition,\nMandela withdrew his proposal to drop nationalisation as an option.\nThe battle continued throughout . Determined to ensure that the ANC did\nnot lose sight of its socialist principles once it was involved in a government of\nnational unity, a group of trade unionists, communists and ANC officials\ninitiated the idea of a \u2018reconstruction\u2019 programme setting out a string of radical\nproposals. The reconstruction and development programme, as it was eventually\ncalled, went through six drafts before the final version was approved. In the end,\nthe ANC emerged committed to fiscal and monetary discipline and stressing the\nimportance of the private sector and the need to develop a favourable investment\nclimate. Privatisation, as well as nationalisation, was cited as a policy option. No\nmention was made of the word \u2018socialism\u2019.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Mandela went through a routine of explaining how the\nreconstruction and development programme would bring more jobs, more\nhouses, better education and health services. His speeches tended to be dull and\ndidactic, delivered in a stiff and wooden manner, something of an anticlimax\nafter the frenzy and excitement surrounding his arrival. While promising a better\nfuture, he spent much time trying to damp down black expectations. Change, he\nwarned, must be gradual and there must be no dislocation: \u2018Do not expect to be\ndriving a Mercedes the day after the elections. You must have patience. You\nmight have to wait for five years for results to show.\u2019 Narrowing the gap in\nincome, employment and education between white and black would not be easy.\nBlack demands for land and better living standards would have to be addressed\nwithout taking white assets.\nMandela was equally forthright in upbraiding his audience for bad habits: \u2018If\n\n\fyou want to continue living in unbridled poverty, without clothes and food, then\ngo and drink in shebeens. But if you want better things you must work hard. We\ncannot do it all for you; you must do it yourselves.\u2019 Mandela also took men to\ntask for failing to undertake more domestic chores. \u2018I make my own bed. I can\ncook a decent meal. I can polish a floor,\u2019 he said. \u2018Why can\u2019t you do it?\u2019\nWhite audiences sometimes received the same stern treatment. When a white\nbusinessman in Potchefstroom expressed concern about the number of\ncommunists active within the ANC, Mandela responded by admonishing his\naudience for being selfish, hypocritical and racist, in the manner of a Dutch\nReformed predikant railing against a congregation of sinners. The Communist\nParty and the ANC had fought the brutal system of apartheid together, he said.\nTogether, members of both organisations had suffered harassment, arrest and\nimprisonment: \u2018Homes were broken up by a government professing to be\nChristian.\u2019 The Communist Party had done none of these things, but rather, \u2018You\nChristians have done them. Why should we listen to you about our comrades in\nthe Communist Party?\u2019 Mandela continued: \u2018Is this not a sign of selfishness on\nyour part? You have the temerity to come to me . . . [expecting that] I will say to\nan ally with whom we have fought and suffered that we will now abandon them,\non the verge of victory\u2014on your instructions. You, who have no concern for\nme.\u2019 Apartheid, he said, had been inflicted on masses of people by \u2018a community\nwhich claimed to be committed to religious values . . . You must stand ashamed.\nYour community used the word of God to justify [apartheid].\u2019\nAt the behest of his campaign managers, Mandela and a group of other elderly\ninmates, including Sisulu, Mbeki and Kathrada, returned to Robben Island in\nFebruary , accompanied by a horde of television crews and journalists. The\nevent was full of good humour, rarely affording a glimpse of the anguish that\nprisoners there suffered. In the cramped space of cell number seven, Mandela\ndemonstrated how, by standing at an angle, he had been able to wave his arms\nabout for exercise. Looking through the barred window of the cell, he grinned\nbroadly at the photographers outside. \u2018Could we have one serious one, please?\u2019\npleaded a photographer.\n\u2018My advisers tell me that on this occasion, I should talk about myself and not\nbe shy,\u2019 he said. He spoke at length of the hardship of working in the lime\nquarry, of the isolation of his prison cell, of the stimulation of political\ndiscussions with his colleagues. Only once did he mention personal grief, in\nrecalling the death of his mother and his oldest son. His favourite topic was the\n\n\fcomradeship of his fellow prisoners. Taking a stroll in the lime quarry, he\nrecalled, \u2018Quarry work was hard at first, but we sang freedom songs as we\nworked.\u2019 A television journalist asked, \u2018Could you sing a freedom song for us\nnow, Mr Mandela?\u2019 and he duly obliged. When their duty to the media was\ndone, Sisulu remarked, \u2018It\u2019s nice to know that I\u2019ll be going home at the end of\nthe day.\u2019\nMandela enjoyed a good working relationship with journalists. He was\nattentive to their needs and invariably courteous, apologising whenever he was\nlate. When a British journalist died in a car accident during the campaign,\nMandela found time in the middle of a hectic schedule to phone his wife,\nspeaking to her for nearly half an hour. He particularly enjoyed the company of\nwomen journalists, befriending two or three of them, with whom he used to flirt\nwhen the occasion permitted. One was Deborah Patta, a reporter for\nJohannesburg\u2019s Radio . During the visit to Robben Island, seeing her\nstruggle with a heavy bag loaded with radio equipment, Mandela asked if he\ncould carry it for her. Once, at the end of a summit meeting when journalists had\nbeen waiting for six hours, he spotted his friend: \u2018Deborah, I am most concerned.\nHave you had an opportunity to have any food today?\u2019\nOccasionally, amid the constant stream of promises about jobs and housing,\nthe election campaign was enlivened by an exchange of insults. Mandela derided\nde Klerk\u2019s efforts to woo black voters for the National Party: \u2018They are a\npathetic collection of weaklings unable to reconcile themselves with the fate of\nextinction that stares them in the face.\u2019 The National Party had never served the\nmass of South Africans: \u2018They only know how to serve the white community.\u2019\nDe Klerk, for his part, avoided personal attacks on Mandela, but branded the\nANC as \u2018a dangerous party\u2019, with no experience, no proven ability and addicted\nto policies of nationalisation, communism and socialism which had failed\neverywhere else in the world: \u2018The ANC would cast us back into the Dark Ages.\nIt is secretly controlled by communists, militants and extremists. They are quiet\nnow but they will shout loudly if the ANC wins control.\u2019\nThere was also controversy about a number of unsavoury characters standing\nas candidates, in particular Winnie Mandela. In December , Winnie\nmanaged to claw her way back to election as president of the ANC\u2019s Women\u2019s\nLeague which entitled her to a place on the national executive committee.\nDespite her criminal conviction, she was then chosen as a candidate for the party\n\n\flist for parliament, in effect ensuring her a seat. The return of Winnie came as a\nnasty surprise to prominent figures in the ANC hierarchy who had assumed that\nher forced resignation from all ANC posts the year before had settled her fate.\nWhen Mandela was asked how he could justify having a convicted criminal on\nhis list of candidates, he replied glibly that Winnie had been the choice of the\npeople, a matter with which the ANC could not interfere.\nThe National Party was quick to take advantage of the event. Full-page\nnewspaper advertisements appeared containing a large photograph of Winnie\nMandela, her right arm raised in a clenched-fist salute, with a three-paragraph\ncommentary beneath which said:\nOn  July  Winnie Mandela was convicted of kidnapping a child who later\ndied from his wounds. On  December  she was elected to be the most\npowerful woman in the ANC, the president of the ANC Women\u2019s League. After\n April , Mrs Mandela could be your new Minister of Law and Order, or\neven the Minister of Child Welfare. . . . Only your vote can stop this.\nThe climax of the campaign was a televised debate between Mandela and de\nKlerk before a panel of journalists. The questions they were asked and the\nground over which they skirmished, after weeks of campaigning, were largely\nfamiliar to viewers. What counted as much as content was style. De Klerk, more\ncomfortable on television than Mandela, maintained a conciliatory countenance,\nadmitting past wrongs, promising reconciliation, focusing on policy issues.\nMandela was grim-faced, more aggressive, resorting to personal attacks on de\nKlerk\u2019s character and credibility, tending to dwell on the past evils of apartheid\nand sharply critical of the National Party\u2019s record.\nBut towards the end of the debate, thinking that he had been too harsh on de\nKlerk, Mandela made a dramatic gesture. \u2018The exchanges between Mr de Klerk\nand I should not obscure one important fact,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think we are a shining\nexample to the entire world of people drawn from different racial groups who\nhave a common loyalty, a common love, to their common country. . . . In spite of\nmy criticism of Mr de Klerk,\u2019 he went on, looking across to de Klerk, \u2018sir, you\nare one of those I rely upon. . . . We are going to face the problems of this\ncountry together.\u2019 Then, reaching over to de Klerk, he said, \u2018I am proud to hold\nyour hand for us to go forward.\u2019\nDe Klerk clasped his hand and smiled wanly.\n\n\fThroughout the election campaign, the threat of conflict edged ever closer.\nButhelezi\u2019s answer to the ANC\u2019s refusal to countenance any further\nconstitutional concessions was to reject Inkatha\u2019s participation in the election.\nHis rhetoric became increasingly belligerent. \u2018It is impossible for me to lie to\nyou and reassure you that the IFP\u2019s opposition to fighting the election under the\npresent constitution will not bring casualties and even death,\u2019 he told a special\nInkatha congress in Ulundi in January . \u2018But we must resist the ANC and\ntheir communist surrogates. We are the only thing that stands in the way of their\nquest for power.\u2019 He urged followers to \u2018fight back\u2019, telling them, \u2018This is a\nregion where we dominate. No foreign forces shall come into it to rule over us.\u2019\nTo shore up his position, Buthelezi drew the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelethini,\ninto the confrontation. A weak, pusillanimous figure, Zwelethini had been\npushed around for years by Buthelezi, who once spent a whole afternoon in the\nKwaZulu legislative assembly heaping abuse on the king, causing him such\ndistress that he jumped from his seat and ran out of the chamber. Nevertheless,\nallegiance to the king was far more widespread among Zulus than any loyalty to\nInkatha. His influence was much greater than Buthelezi\u2019s on his own.\nThe issue which helped galvanize Zwelethini was the ANC\u2019s insistence on\nremoving the name of KwaZulu from the map of South Africa. In a\nmemorandum sent to de Klerk in January, Zwelethini said that this rendered the\nnew constitution \u2018so alien\u2019 that he felt obliged to reject it: \u2018It amounts to the\nexpunging of the very name of my kingdom from the constitution of South\nAfrica. We cannot, therefore, be expected to regard it as our constitution. This\nhas sent shock waves throughout the psyche of everyone of our Zulu subjects.\u2019\nGoaded on by Buthelezi, by February the king had become more ambitious.\nHe now demanded a sovereign Zulu kingdom encompassing the whole of Natal,\nrestoring what he claimed were its s boundaries, before the era of white\nconquest. \u2018I am asking for something that belongs to me and my people\u2014no one\nelse,\u2019 he said. In public speeches, he began to use the same kind of rhetoric as\nButhelezi: \u2018I will die rather than insult the memory of my great ancestral kings\nby handing over the land of their people to our political enemies.\u2019 He duly\nrejected the interim constitution and declared he would not abide by the election\nresults.\nMandela was soon forced to concede that the threat to the election was far\n\n\fmore serious than he had anticipated during the first flush of excitement about\nthe prospect of majority rule. By the time the official deadline for the registration\nof parties had been reached on  February, the four key members of the\nFreedom Alliance\u2014Inkatha, the AVF, the Conservative Party and\nBophuthatswana\u2014were all standing firm against participation in the election.\nOnly Ciskei, whose military dictator, Brigadier Gqozo, had succumbed to\npressure from his own troops worried about their career prospects, had thrown in\nits hand. Security briefings given to Mandela warned that rightwing groups were\nmaking serious preparations for resistance, stockpiling weapons, ammunition\nand medical supplies and organising training. The briefings also warned of\ndoubts about the loyalty of security force elements that might be required to deal\nwith rightwing threats at the behest of an ANC-dominated government. The\nassessment of the government was that everything possible had to be done to\navoid any kind of confrontation that would enable the alliance to make a\ncommon stand, drawing large numbers of their followers into the fray.\nThe possibility of active resistance to the election was reinforced by reports\nfrom the Goldstone commission investigating \u2018third force\u2019 activity. In February,\nJudge Goldstone acquired what he later described as \u2018convincing evidence\u2019 of \u2018a\nhorrible network of criminal activity\u2019 involving high-ranking police officers in\nPretoria, Inkatha and the KwaZulu police. This activity, according to Goldstone,\nincluded assassination, train massacres, hostel violence, gunrunning and the\nsubversion of justice. Factories in the Transvaal had been used by a police covert\nunit to manufacture homemade guns which, along with large quantities of other\nweapons, had been smuggled to Inkatha and used in attacks in Natal and on the\nReef. Goldstone emphasised that only a small group within the police force was\ninvolved, but he added, \u2018The whole illegal, criminal and oppressive system is\nstill in place and its architects are in control of the South African police.\u2019 Among\nthe officials whom Goldstone named were the head of police counterintelligence and the police second-in-command. Goldstone recommended that\nthe police commissioner himself should be removed from office forthwith.\nIn an attempt to draw the Freedom Alliance into the constitutional process,\nMandela announced on  February a series of concessions he had previously\nspurned. These included the use of a double ballot for provincial and national\nelections; guarantees of wider powers for provincial government; and the\nrenaming of Natal province to KwaZulu-Natal. Mandela also approved the\ninclusion in the constitution of a principle of \u2018internal\u2019 self-determination for\n\n\fgroups sharing a common culture and language, intended to meet the anxieties of\nboth Zulu and Afrikaner nationalists. He proposed that the issue of a volkstaat\nshould be dealt with by authorising the establishment of a twenty-member\ncouncil, to be elected by MPs who supported the establishment of a volkstaat,\nenabling the idea to be pursued by constitutional means.\nMandela\u2019s concessions went a long way towards meeting the demands the\nFreedom Alliance had made in December. General Viljoen for one was ready to\naccept the inclusion of a principle of self-determination and a volkstaat council\nas a reasonable basis for agreeing to participate in the election.\nBut Buthelezi was determined to get more, believing that the election could\nnot take place without Inkatha. Within hours, without waiting to consult his\ncolleagues in the Freedom Alliance, he dismissed the concessions as nothing\nmore than \u2018cheap politicking\u2019, adding, \u2018Mr Mandela\u2019s supposed concessions do\nnot even begin to address our demands.\u2019\nTo keep the electoral process on course, the Independent Electoral\nCommission imposed a final deadline for political parties to register of  March.\nA further short period was to be allowed after that date for political parties to\npresent their list of candidates, thereby effectively confirming their participation\nin the election. The deadline set for that, eventually, was  March.\nIn a final effort to bring Inkatha into the election, Mandela arranged to meet\nButhelezi in Durban on  March. Addressing a political rally beforehand,\nMandela declared, \u2018I will go down on my knees to beg those who want to drag\nour country into bloodshed and to persuade them not to do so.\u2019 The meeting was\nonly their fourth encounter in the four years since Mandela\u2019s release from\nprison. It brought no movement in the dispute over the constitution, but what it\ndid produce was a deal of minor significance which was to have profound\nrepercussions. In exchange for Mandela\u2019s agreement to submit their differences\non the constitution to international mediation\u2014a device which Buthelezi hoped\nwould postpone the election altogether\u2014Buthelezi agreed to register Inkatha for\nthe election \u2018provisionally\u2019.\nButhelezi\u2019s sudden turnabout on the election threw his allies in the Freedom\nAlliance into turmoil. Rival groups within each party argued over which course\nto take. General Viljoen and his fellow retired generals decided to keep open the\npossibility of rightwing participation in the election by registering a new party,\nthe Freedom Front, arriving at the registration office with only minutes to spare\n\n\fbefore the deadline of midnight on  March. But their action was immediately\ndenounced by other Volksfront leaders. The Conservative Party rejected\nparticipation in the election, as did Bophuthatswana\u2019s president, Lucas\nMangope.\nMangope\u2019s refusal to take part in the election plunged Bophuthatswana into\ncrisis. Accustomed to ruling with an iron rod and relying on the police to silence\nopponents, Mangope had little respect for the groundswell of public discontent\nbuilding up. Technically, under South African law, Bophuthatswana was still an\nindependent state. Nevertheless, the adult population of  million had been given\nthe right to vote in the April election. Bophuthatswana\u2019s fate, once the election\nhad taken place, was to be reincorporated into South Africa as part of North\nWest Province. Civil servants and other public-sector workers, worried about\ntheir pensions and their future after the election, launched a wave of strikes.\nANC supporters, resentful of Mangope\u2019s curbs on political activity, joined the\nfray.\nMangope\u2019s response to the disturbances was to ignore them. \u2018I love him\ndearly, but he is living in a different world,\u2019 reported South Africa\u2019s\n\u2018ambassador\u2019 to Bophuthatswana, Tjaart van der Walt. \u2018I failed to convey a\nsense of reality to him.\u2019 Mandela, in his conversations with Mangope, urging\nhim to let the people of Bophuthatswana decide their future, also admitted\nfailure: \u2018It seems I am talking to a stone. I think we have now given him enough\ntime. I have tried to reason with him but it is clear he has no vision. Further\npressures will be used and I have no doubt he will not be able to withstand\nthem.\u2019\nAided and abetted by ANC activists, the strikes spread through\nBophuthatswana,\ncrippling\ncivil\nservice\ndepartments,\nschools,\ntelecommunications, health services, electricity supplies, transport and industry.\nRadio and television broadcasts went off the air. Running battles broke out\nbetween police and striking workers and students. Looters began to raid\nshopping centres. Policemen started to defect. The demands of the strikers no\nlonger centred just on pension payments but included demands for\nBophuthatswana\u2019s immediate reincorporation into South Africa, for free and fair\nelections and for Mangope\u2019s removal.\nFacing popular revolt, Mangope took action with such potential for disaster\nthat it suggested he had lost all touch with reason. On  March, he contacted\n\n\fGeneral Viljoen, his Freedom Alliance partner, pleading for help from armed\nwhite paramilitary groups in the extremist Afrikaner Volksfront. Mangope\u2019s\nonly stipulation was that Viljoen was not to include any AWB men, notorious\nfor their lawless conduct and racist attacks on blacks. Viljoen agreed to\ncooperate. On  March, he mobilised , men and dispatched some , of\nthem to Mangope\u2019s capital, Mmabatho, carrying only side-arms. The plan was\nfor the AVF force to rendezvous at the town\u2019s airport with units from the\nBophuthatswana Defence Force, which was commanded by white officers who\nwould provide them with weapons. As they headed for Mmabatho, many\nrightwingers believed that they might be on the verge of establishing a volkstaat.\nThe plan went awry from the start. The AWB leader, Terre\u2019Blanche, learning\nof the instruction to mobilise, issued a call, broadcast on a rightwing radio\nstation near Pretoria, for his supporters to join in. On the night of  March,\nhundreds of AWB members, armed with an assortment of shotguns and hunting\nrifles, crossed into Bophuthatswana in convoys of pick-up trucks. Their arrival\nprovoked immediate dissension. White officers in the BDF ordered them out, but\nthey refused to leave and went on what was described as \u2018a kaffir-shooting\u2019\nexpedition in the streets of Mmabatho, firing at random at bystanders and\nterrorising local inhabitants. BDF troops mutinied, leaving Viljoen\u2019s men\nwithout weapons. The operation swiftly collapsed. As the AWB pulled out, one\nof its vehicles, carrying three men, was caught in a gun fight with troops\nmanning a roadblock. One man was killed outright; his two companions\nsurvived but were executed by a policeman as they lay on the ground, in full\nview of television cameras. The scene was replayed on South African television\nagain and again.\nAs the South African army moved into Mmabatho to restore a semblance of\norder, the fate of Mangope remained undecided. De Klerk was willing to allow\nhim to stay in office, provided he agreed to participate in the election and\nallowed free political activity, but Mandela would have none of it, saying that\nMangope had obstructed the electoral process, precipitated the crisis and should\nbe removed from office immediately. On  March, the transitional executive\ncouncil duly resolved that Mangope should be deposed. A deputation was sent to\nhis luxurious house near Zeerust to tell him. Mangope tried to argue, but to no\navail.\nThese events in Bophuthatswana produced dramatic changes across the\npolitical landscape. The threat of organised rightwing resistance to the election\n\n\feffectively collapsed. The AWB had been shown up to be nothing more than a\nmurderous rabble. Fear of the extreme right gave way to ridicule. While\nTerre\u2019Blanche tried to claim his men had scored a \u2018brilliant victory\u2019 in\nBophuthatswana, many Afrikaners were disgusted by this farcical boasting\ncarried out in the name of the Afrikaner people.\nThe Freedom Alliance also collapsed. Appalled by the fiasco of armed\nintervention in Bophuthatswana, Viljoen broke with the AVF and, with only\nminutes to spare before the deadline at midnight on  March, lodged a list of\nFreedom Front candidates ready to participate in the election, providing a vital\nroute for the far-right to remain in the political process. Several prominent\nmembers of the Conservative Party announced they would join him.\nButhelezi\u2019s position became increasingly isolated. Unlike Viljoen, he failed to\nregister a list of candidates, effectively eliminating himself and Inkatha from the\nelection. But his options were limited. The only way he could prevent the ANC\nfrom winning control of KwaZulu-Natal at the polls was to stop the election\ntaking place and force a postponement in the hope that a more favourable deal\nmight be obtained at a later stage, possibly through international mediation. The\nonly way of doing this was to threaten violence or to use it. Yet the events in\nBophuthatswana had shown that Mandela and de Klerk were determined to\nprotect the election process from obstruction and that the South African military\nwere ready to support them. They were equally adamant that the election would\nnot be postponed.\nTen days after Mangope\u2019s downfall, Buthelezi\u2019s last remaining ally, Brigadier\nGqozo, capitulated. Faced with striking civil servants and rebellious police,\nGqozo asked Pretoria to take over Ciskei\u2019s administration. Once again, South\nAfrican troops moved in to secure control. \u2018Two down,\u2019 commented Joe Slovo\ngleefully, \u2018one more to go.\u2019\nIn the wake of Bophuthatswana and Ciskei, ANC officials, sensing that\nanother victory was within their reach, became increasingly arrogant. Slovo\npredicted that Buthelezi would be \u2018merely a smell in history\u2019 after the election,\nboasting that he himself, a non-Zulu, could get more votes in KwaZulu-Natal\nthan Buthelezi. Ramaphosa spoke recklessly of the need for a military solution,\nhaving no concept of what it involved. For those in Ulundi, the message was all\ntoo clear: the ANC wanted to smash KwaZulu by force.\nYet Buthelezi\u2019s power base was far stronger than the glib pronouncements of\n\n\fANC politicians suggested. In the rural backwaters of KwaZulu-Natal lived\nseveral million Zulus ready to obey the command of their traditional chiefs, the\namakhosi, who remained loyal to Buthelezi. Moreover, Buthelezi had the\nsupport of the king. Talk of a military solution in these circumstances was\nnothing more than a dangerous fantasy. The military had neither the capacity to\ntake control of Buthelezi\u2019s administration in Ulundi without precipitating a\nrevolt nor the means to suppress the insurgency that was bound to follow.\nThe scale of violence was already immense. Some , people had died in\nKwaZulu-Natal over the previous six years. As the election approached, the\nconflict became ever more deadly. A group of fifteen ANC election workers,\nafter putting up election posters, were shot and hacked to death. Election activity\nof any kind became a dangerous business in many areas. The level of\nintimidation from both sides soared by the day. \u2018Vote?\u2019 said a retired teacher in\nPort Shepstone. \u2018Why vote? Inkatha is killing us, the ANC is killing us. We are\nall going to die.\u2019\nAfter a visit to KwaZulu in March, vainly seeking local assistance for staging\nthe election, the head of the Independent Electoral Commission, Judge Kriegler,\nwarned Mandela and de Klerk that without a sufficient degree of stability and\ncooperation, free and fair elections in KwaZulu-Natal would be frustrated.\nKriegler spoke of his determination to mount an election. KwaZulu alone\npossessed some . million potential voters, about  per cent of Natal\u2019s black\nelectorate and some  per cent of the national electorate. Without its\ninvolvement, the overall election result would be seriously impaired. What was\nrequired, said Kriegler, was a political initiative.\nBoth sides meanwhile resorted to shows of strength. On  March, the ANC\norganised a march through the city centre of Durban. Despite fears of violence,\nthe event passed off relatively peacefully. Inkatha then decided to respond in\nkind in Johannesburg, but with calamitous results.\nOn  March, thousands of Zulus, brandishing spears, clubs and cowhide\nshields, marched through the streets of the city\u2019s main business district to a rally\nat Library Gardens. The demonstration turned into a bloodbath when snipers\nopened fire from nearby buildings. For several hours, as Zulus went on the\nrampage, the streets in the city were scenes of chaos. At the ANC\u2019s headquarters\nat Shell House, ANC security guards shot and killed eight protesters who they\nclaimed were trying to storm the building; eyewitnesses disputed their account.\n\n\fBy the end of the day, fifty-three people were dead, most of them demonstrators.\nThe spectacle of central Johannesburg being turned into a war zone set off a\nwave of alarm throughout South Africa and far beyond its borders. The prospect\nof a peaceful election seemed increasingly remote. Public confidence in the\ntransition and in the ability of South Africa\u2019s politicians to manage it\nsuccessfully rapidly waned at home and abroad. In anticipation of further\nviolence, a surge of stockpiling began\u2014canned food, candles, batteries, Primus\nstoves, toilet paper, guns and ammunition. Foreign investors too lost faith,\nwithdrawing funds and shelving plans.\nThe event also tarnished Mandela\u2019s reputation. He was not present when Zulu\ndemonstrators arrived outside Shell House, but the following day, when police\nwanted to search the premises for weapons and for forensic evidence, he\npersonally refused to allow them entry. Asked later at a press conference if, in a\nnew government, his law and order minister would allow political opponents to\nset conditions for police probes into criminal activity, he replied, \u2018Let\u2019s face that\nwhen we are the government. I am entitled to negotiate with law and order\nofficials. \u2019 The Johannesburg Sunday Times observed caustically, \u2018What a rare\nachievement for the ANC. It has succeeded in putting itself above the law before\ntaking power. In most banana republics it happens the other way around.\u2019 A year\nlater, Mandela admitted that he had instructed ANC security guards on the phone\nthat day to shoot to kill demonstrators if necessary to protect the building.\nThe carnage in Johannesburg set Buthelezi off on another round of wild\nrhetoric. \u2018The Shell House massacre shows that we have now entered a final\nstruggle to the finish between the ANC and the Zulu nation,\u2019 he said. The only\nway this could be prevented, he claimed, was to postpone the election.\nWith less than three weeks to go before the polls were due to open, Mandela,\nde Klerk, Buthelezi and Zwelethini finally agreed to meet to see if they could\nhammer out terms for Inkatha\u2019s participation in the election and decide about the\nking\u2019s future status. Mandela believed that the key to defusing the crisis was to\nprise Zwelethini away from Buthelezi. He drew up a proposal offering to\nentrench the Zulu monarchy with constitutional powers in the new constitution\nof KwaZulu-Natal and to provide it with a royal constabulary and a budget,\ngiving the king a status not even accorded him under the KwaZulu constitution.\nThe only condition Mandela wanted for all this was Zwelethini\u2019s support for the\nelection. He hoped to be able to speak to Zwelethini in private in advance of\n\n\fformal discussions.\nThe meeting, held on  April at Skukuza, a lodge in the Kruger National Park,\nwas ill-tempered. Mandela found no opportunity to talk to Zwelethini in private.\nSurrounded by Buthelezi\u2019s aides, the king appeared as obdurate and\nuncooperative as Buthelezi himself. For his part, Buthelezi rejected the idea that\nthe king\u2019s requirements could be separated from Inkatha\u2019s demands and insisted\nthat the election be postponed. Mandela refused: \u2018That day is sacrosanct.\u2019 The\nmeeting ended in deadlock. The only matter they could agree on was to allow\ninternational mediation to proceed.\nBut even this ended in farce. A mediation team, including the former US\nsecretary of state, Henry Kissinger, and the former British foreign secretary,\nLord Carrington, arrived in Johannesburg only to find that the ANC and Inkatha\ncould not agree its terms of reference. Buthelezi wanted mediation to include the\nelection date; the ANC did not. The mediators promptly left.\nWith the failure of international mediation, Buthelezi had exhausted viable\noptions. His strategy of obstruction had left him completely isolated. Out of\nreach of Buthelezi, King Zwelethini sent an emissary to Mandela telling him that\nhe wanted to accept his offer on the Zulu monarchy. Inkatha was rumbling with\ndiscontent at the prospect of being denied a legitimate place in the new\ndispensation; civil servants in Ulundi were deeply worried about the risk to their\nsalaries and pensions. Buthelezi himself faced nothing more than a future in the\nwilderness.\nOn  April, with only seven days remaining, Buthelezi capitulated, accepting\nthe offer of a constitutional role for the Zulu monarchy and abandoning all his\nother demands.\n\nIn the early morning, as the sun rose over the green rolling hills of Natal, Nelson\nMandela stood beside a grave in the grounds of a small rural school in Inanda,\nthinking of old friends like Oliver Tambo, Bram Fischer and Albert Luthuli who\nwould not be voting that day. Mandela had chosen to come to Inanda, near\nDurban, to cast his vote, for it was there that the founding president of the ANC,\nJohn Dube, was buried, and it was the school that he had founded which was to\nserve as a polling station during the election. After laying a wreath on Dube\u2019s\ngrave, he walked down the slope towards the school. \u2018I did not go into that\n\n\fvoting station alone,\u2019 he said. \u2018I was casting my vote with all of them.\u2019\nHe emerged from the polling station, his face wreathed in smiles, and spoke of\na bright future. \u2018This is for all South Africans an unforgettable occasion,\u2019 he\nsaid. \u2018We are moving from an era of resistance, division, oppression, turmoil and\nconflict and starting a new era of hope, reconciliation and nation-building.\u2019\nIn their millions, South Africans made their way to the polls, black and white\ncitizens alike sharing a common determination to make the election a success.\nMany walked miles to reach a polling station. Some arrived on crutches and\nsome in wheelchairs; some dressed in their Sunday-best clothes and some wore\noutfits they had made specially for the occasion.\nLong queues formed outside polling stations, circling around city blocks and\nwinding back along dirt roads and across fields. Many arriving in the early\nmorning were still waiting to vote late in the afternoon, tired and hungry; some\nin rural areas had to vote by candlelight. Yet, hour after hour, they remained\npatient. And when they finally returned home, having voted, it was with a sense\nof profound fulfillment, not just from participating in the election of a new\ngovernment, but from exercising a right which had been denied to most South\nAfricans for so long. Time and again, voters leaving polling stations spoke of\nhow their dignity had been restored.\nOn each of the four polling days, South Africa was more peaceful than it had\nbeen for many years. The fever of violence suddenly abated. Even the killing\nfields of KwaZulu-Natal fell silent. On the Witwatersrand, members of rival\nfactions found themselves joining the same queue in townships, swapping\ncomplaints about the long delays.\nFor many whites, the experience of the election was as moving as it was for\nblacks. Standing side by side with blacks, waiting to vote, they felt a sense of\ntheir own liberation. The feelings of relief that the curse of apartheid had finally\nbeen lifted were as strong among the white community which had imposed it as\namong the blacks who suffered under it.\nThere were many incidents which marred the election. Afrikaner extremists\nstaged a series of bomb attacks, one in the centre of Johannesburg\u2019s business\ndistrict, another at its international airport, killing twenty-one civilians and\ninjuring nearly  others. But the effect was to increase the resolve of voters\nnot to be deterred.\n\n\fThe performance of the Independent Electoral Commission was woefully\ndefective and at times so incompetent that it threatened the whole electoral\nprocess. Shortages of ballot papers, ballot boxes and other equipment created\nchaos at many polling stations. The counting process was equally flawed.\nOpportunities for electoral fraud proliferated. Serious disputes arose over the\nconduct of the election in KwaZulu-Natal.\nBut rising above all the muddle and confusion was the clear verdict of the\npeople. By voting in their millions, free from intimidation and from violence and\nwith great dignity, South Africans ensured that the birth of their democracy was\na triumph.\nThe results, moreover, were broadly acceptable to all sides. The vast bulk of\nthe black electorate provided the ANC with a handsome victory: the ANC\nobtained . per cent of the vote, taking . million of the . million valid\nvotes cast, gaining  seats in the -seat National Assembly and winning\ncontrol of seven of nine provincial assemblies. But the ANC failed to gain the\ntwo-thirds majority which would have given it the power to write the final\nconstitution on its own, thereby helping to still the fears of minority groups that\nit would be tempted to ride roughshod over their interests. Some ANC officials\nwere disappointed, but Mandela was not one of them. He wanted the final\nconstitution to achieve a broader measure of support. A majority of the white,\nColoured and Indian communities held fast to the National Party, giving it .\nper cent of the vote and control of the Western Cape province. Zulu nationalists\nvoted for Inkatha, giving it only . per cent of the national poll but  per cent\nof the KwaZulu-Natal provincial vote and therefore control of the provincial\nassembly a key factor in defusing the potential for another round of political\nwarfare. Afrikaner nationalists, hoping for a volkstaat, put their trust in the\nFreedom Front, but in smaller numbers than General Viljoen had hoped: the\nFreedom Front obtained , votes, less than half the target Viljoen had set\nand only . per cent of the national poll. A diminished band of white liberals\nvoted for the Democratic Party, giving it . per cent of the national poll.\nFinally, an insignificant rump of black radicals voted for the Pan-Africanist\nCongress, which won only . per cent of the vote.\nThe victory of the ANC at the polls was as much a personal tribute to\nMandela as it was to the movement he led. His ordeal of imprisonment had\nnever been forgotten by the people for whom he spoke and was duly\nacknowledged when the time came for them to vote. Time and again, it was said,\n\n\f\u2018He went to prison for us.\u2019 For blacks, the election was, above all, about\nliberation\u2014a celebration of their freedom from white rule\u2014and it was to\nMandela\u2019s leadership that many attributed that liberation.\nThe transfer of power was accomplished in an atmosphere of much goodwill.\nClosing the book on three centuries of white rule, de Klerk chose words of\nencouragement fitting for such a historic moment: \u2018Mr Mandela has walked a\nlong road and now stands at the top of a hill. A man of destiny knows that\nbeyond this hill lies another and another. The journey is never complete. As he\ncontemplates the next hill, I hold out my hand to Mr Mandela in friendship and\ncooperation.\u2019\nIn his victory speech, Mandela was equally gracious. After congratulating de\nKlerk for the strong showing the National Party had made in the election, he\ncontinued: \u2018I also want to congratulate him for the . . . four years that we have\nworked together, quarrelled, addressed sensitive problems and at the end of our\nheated exchanges were able to shake hands and to drink coffee.\u2019\nAt a victory celebration in the ballroom of the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg,\nwhich he attended despite a heavy dose of flu, Mandela took to the floor with a\nslow, dignified solo dance before an exuberant crowd of ANC luminaries. The\ndance was quickly copied in the townships and became known as \u2018The\nPresident\u2019s Jive\u2019, performed to much merriment in a stiff, wooden manner with a\nfixed smile.\nAt every opportunity, Mandela sought to calm the apprehensions of whites\nand other minorities about the coming of majority rule. The liberation struggle,\nhe said, had not been a fight against any one group but against a system of\noppression. \u2018Nothing we can say can fully describe the misery of our people as a\nresult of the apartheid repression,\u2019 he told a multi-denominational thanksgiving\nservice in Soweto. \u2018But the day we have been fighting for has come. Let us\nforget the past.\u2019 He made an emotional plea for people of all races to \u2018hold\nhands\u2019 and unite: \u2018The time has come for men and women, Africans, Coloureds,\nIndians, whites, Afrikaners and English-speaking, to say: we are one country; we\nare one people.\u2019\nOn the occasion of Mandela\u2019s election as president in parliament in Cape\nTown on  May, the same spirit of reconciliation prevailed. To thunderous\napplause, Mandela and de Klerk entered the chamber together. They walked\ndown the central aisle, shook hands, then went their separate ways, Mandela to\n\n\fthe government side, de Klerk to the opposition benches. Before the swearing-in\nceremony, Mandela left his seat and crossed the floor several times to greet other\nopposition leaders, first embracing and shaking hands with Buthelezi, then\nGeneral Viljoen and finally Clarence Makwetu of the Pan-Africanist Congress.\nMandela\u2019s nomination as president was proposed by Albertina Sisulu and went\nunopposed. The chief justice, Michael Corbett, announced, \u2018I accordingly\ndeclare Mr Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela duly elected as the President of the\nRepublic of South Africa.\u2019 The house erupted in cheering.\nOnly one note of discord was apparent. After Winnie Mandela had been\nsworn in as a member of parliament alongside her husband, she sat next to him\nbriefly. But Mandela stared straight ahead, ignoring her, according her not the\nslightest sign of recognition, his face grim and cold. There was to be no\nreconciliation with Winnie.\nThe day of Mandela\u2019s inauguration,  May , was marked by the greatest\ncelebrations ever seen in South Africa. From all over the world, visiting\ndignitaries\u2014heads of state, royalty and government leaders representing some\n countries\u2014gathered in Pretoria, as much in tribute to Mandela as to mark\nSouth Africa\u2019s rite of passage. The acclaim he received that day from around the\nworld was unique: no other world leader could match the stature he had achieved\nin fighting for the cause of democracy. But even more important was the acclaim\nhe was accorded by South Africans, both black and white. That too was unique.\nFor in fighting for so long for national reconciliation in such a divided country,\nMandela had earned measures of trust and admiration that were his alone.\nIn a glittering array, the guests assembled in the amphitheatre in front of\nUnion Buildings, the monumental sandstone edifice designed by Herbert Baker,\nbuilt during the years of British rule after the Anglo-Boer War and regarded ever\nsince as the bastion of white power. Among the guests whom Mandela\npersonally invited were three of his former prison warders.\nInevitably, there were family dramas beneath the surface. Winnie was among\nthe first of the luminaries to arrive, resplendent in a long green silk dress.\nInitially she was shown to a seat among lesser dignitaries, sitting there in fury\nuntil she was allowed on to the main podium with a seat next to Zindzi.\nMandela\u2019s son, Makgatho, remained in Durban, where he was busy with law\nexams. His daughter Maka - ziwe, an academic at the University of the\nWitwatersrand, attended, but she had previously made it known that she voted\n\n\ffor the Democratic Party. Mandela\u2019s first wife, Evelyn, stayed at home in\nCofimvaba. For his escort, Mandela chose Zenani, who sat alongside him on the\npodium, wearing an outsize top hat.\nWith all duly assembled, the new national flag was slowly raised to the\naccompaniment of two national anthems. One was \u2018Nkosi Sikelel\u2019 iAfrika\u2019, \u2018God\nBless Africa\u2019, the song composed by the Xhosa teacher Enoch Sontonga at\nJohannesburg\u2019s Nancefield location in  and first performed in . It had\nmade a strong impression at the inaugural meeting of the ANC in  and was\nofficially adopted as its anthem in . The other was \u2018Die Stem van Suid\nAfrika\u2019, \u2018The Voice of South Africa\u2019, a poem written in  by the Afrikaner\nnationalist writer C. J. Langenhoven and set to music in . It had become\nSouth Africa\u2019s national anthem after the National Party victory in . Neither\ngroup was familiar with the other\u2019s anthem, but for Mandela, standing to\nattention with his hand across his heart in a mark of respect, the playing of the\ntwo national anthems symbolised the true importance of the day\u2019s events.\nIn his inaugural address as president, Mandela emphasised the need for South\nAfricans to build a new society from the legacy of apartheid: \u2018Out of the\nexperience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long must be born\na society of which all humanity will be proud.\u2019\nHe went on:\nThe time for the healing of the wounds has come. The moment to bridge the\nchasms that divide us has come. The time to build is upon us.\nWe have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. We pledge ourselves to\nliberate all our people from the continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation,\nsuffering, gender and other discriminations. . . .\nWe enter into a covenant that we shall build the society in which all South\nAfricans, both black and white, will be able to walk tall, without any fear in their\nhearts, assured of their inalienable right to human dignity\u2014a rainbow nation at\npeace with itself and the world.\nTowards the end of his speech, the , guests rose spontane - ously to their\nfeet for an ovation, in a moment of genuine emotion, as he declared, \u2018Never,\nnever and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the\noppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the\nworld.\u2019\n\n\fAs the cheering died down, from a distance, across the hills of the\nMuckleneuk Ridge, came the roar of formations of jet fighters and helicopters\ntrailing the national flag. And as the squadrons passed overhead in a final\naffirmation of white loyalty to black rule, saluting their new commander-inchief, the crowds below erupted with an outpouring of enthusiasm. Many who\nwitnessed that moment of national catharsis were moved to tears. REINVENTING SOUTH AFRICA\nAT THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH OF HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN\nJOHANNESBURG in December , seven months after his inauguration as\npresident, Nelson Mandela joked, in his customary self-deprecating manner, that\nsuch were the rigours of office that he sometimes longed for the relative calm of\nprison. The magnitude of the task of transforming South Africa into a fully\nfledged democracy after centuries of white-minority rule was indeed daunting.\nThe entire system that Mandela inherited had been designed largely to serve\nwhite interests. Other than par liament, all the main institutions\u2014the civil\nservice, the se - curity forces, the business community, the universities, the\nmedia, the stock exchange, the banks and agriculture\u2014were dominated by\nwhites. As Mandela publicly acknowledged, South Africa\u2019s fortunes still\ndepended heavily on the skills, expertise and capital of the white community.\nYet while recognising the need to reassure whites about their future under\nblack rule, he also faced an avalanche of black expectations. In the aftermath of\nhis election victory, the black electorate was impatient for change. Mandela\u2019s\npledges during the election campaign\u2014of more jobs, more housing, better\neducation and health services\u2014still reverberated across the country. All at once,\nthere were so many demands, so many priorities. At the age of seventy-five,\nafter fifty years as a political activist in the titanic struggle to defeat apartheid,\nMandela confronted yet another challenge as formidable as anything that had\ncome before. \u2018I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one\nonly finds that there are many more hills to climb\u2019, he concluded in his\nautobiography.\nMandela\u2019s achievement in securing a negotiated revolution in South Africa in\ncollaboration with its white rulers meant that he inherited an administration both\npowerful enough and sufficiently amenable to begin undertaking the ambitious\ntargets he had set for his government. The old white establishment, comforted by\nde Klerk\u2019s presence in the cabinet as a deputy president, Mandela\u2019s constant\nefforts to reassure whites about their security and the guarantee on jobs and\n\n\fpensions given them under the constitution, adapted to the new government with\nremarkably few qualms. So peaceful was the transfer of power that it brought\nabout a swift resurgence of confidence in the future among the white\ncommunity.\nYet the scale of change envisaged was immense. South Africa needed not just\na new administration capable of undertaking major programmes of economic\nand social development but also a whole new structure of provincial and local\ngovernment, involving the incorporation of former homeland territories into \nnew provinces and the redesign of some  segregated local authorities into\n multiracial bodies. The police service, once at the forefront of enforcing\napartheid laws, required a complete overhaul to make it more acceptable to local\ncommunities. The new national defence force required reorganisation to absorb\nunits from the ANC\u2019s guerrilla army and former homeland armies. The entire\neducation system, where each race group had previously been segregated,\nrequired restructuring. Whereas white public education offered high standards,\nblack public education had suffered from decades of deprivation: many buildings\nwere derelict, one third had no electricity, a quarter had no water, a half had no\nsanitation, one third of teachers were unqualified and many more were underqualified.\nThe legacy of apartheid included a massive disparity in wealth. The average\nwhite income was eight times greater than the average black income. Whites,\nmaking up  per cent of the population, earned  per cent of total income.\nAlthough the black middle class was growing apace, its share of total income\nwas still comparatively small. Barely  per cent of all private-sector assets were\nblack owned. According to calculations published in the United Nations Human\nDevelopment Report for , if white South Africa was treated as a separate\ncountry, its standard of living would rank th in the world, just below Spain\u2019s;\nblack South Africa on the same basis would rank rd, below Lesotho and\nVietnam. Overall, in terms of human development, South Africa ranked only\nrd in the world. Out of a population of  million,  million lacked adequate\nsanitation, including . million in urban areas;  million lacked clean water\nsupply;  million had no access to electricity; and some  million children were\nwithout schools. Almost half of all households in South Africa lived below the\npoverty line; a quarter lived on an income of less than half of the poverty-line\nincome; some  million were estimated to be \u2018completely destitute\u2019. One third of\nthe population was illiterate.\n\n\fThe assets that South Africa possessed to help it overcome this legacy were\nconsiderable. They included one of the world\u2019s richest stores of minerals, with\n per cent of world diamond reserves,  per cent of manganese reserves and\n per cent of platinum-group metal reserves. It was the world\u2019s largest producer\nof gold, mining a third of world production. Its financial, banking and legal\nsystems were well established and efficient; the Johannesburg stock exchange\nwas the tenth largest in the world. Its manufacturing base, though over protected and uncompetitive by world standards, was capable of major\nexpansion. The infrastructure of roads, railways, ports and airports was well\ndeveloped. Telephone and electricity services were reliable. Universities and\ntechnical colleges turned out a ready supply of competent graduates. In statistical\nterms, South Africa, with a gross domestic product of $ billion, ranked as\none of the world\u2019s twenty-five largest economies. In Africa, it stood out as a\ngiant.\nWhat Mandela discovered on taking office, however, was that South Africa\u2019s\neconomy was in dire straits. The ANC had expected to inherit an economic\ncornucopia; its ambitious development plans were based on that notion. But the\ncoffers, in fact, were nearly empty. The previous government had run up a\nrecord budget deficit of . per cent of gross domestic product, and gross foreign\nexchange reserves had fallen to less than the equivalent of three weeks of\nimports. The government\u2019s domestic debt, moreover, was huge. The cost of debt\nservice together with current expenditure consumed  per cent of government\nrevenue, leaving only  per cent for capital spending. \u2018There was simply no\nmoney to do what we had planned\u2019, recalled one of Mandela\u2019s key ministers,\nMac Maharaj. \u2018We had to dump our blueprints and start from the beginning\u2019.\nThe unemployment figures on their own represented a sizeable crisis. Only\nabout half of the economically active population had formal-sector jobs. Several\nmillion more earned a living in the informal sector\u2014hawkers, small traders,\ndomestics and backyard businesses. Even so, the official unemployment rate was\ncalculated as  per cent. A high proportion of the estimated  million\nunemployed possessed no skills or training and had little prospect of ever finding\na job. Of the , new entrants to the labour market in , only ,\nwere expected to be able to find a job. On average, the formal sector of the\neconomy could absorb no more than  per cent of new entrants to the labour\nmarket. When the new government advertised civil service vacancies for ,\nmanagers, clerks and cleaners, more than . million people applied.\n\n\fEconomic growth in recent years had been dismal. In the longest recession in\nits recorded history, South Africa\u2019s GDP had fallen by . per cent in , by\n. per cent in  and by . per cent in , a drop caused mainly by\ndrought disrupting agricultural production. Over the four-year period from \nto , the aggregate fall in GDP had amounted to . per cent. Formal\nemployment between  and  had fallen by more than ,. Merely to\nabsorb the annual number of new entrants into the labour market required an\nannual growth rate of  per cent. To make any inroads into the rate of\nunemployment required a growth rate of between  and  per cent.\nNot only was the economic legacy none too healthy, but, as Mandela\nrecognised, his ability to make progress on his development objectives depended\nheavily on attracting foreign capital. Even with the support of the private sector,\nlocal resources were not sufficient to raise the annual growth rate much above \nper cent. Yet foreign investors were wary of the ANC\u2019s long history of\nadvocating nationalisation and state control of the economy and reluctant to\ncommit themselves until they could see something of the new government\u2019s\ntrack record. Mindful of the need to convince foreign and local investors about\nthe government\u2019s determination to pursue fiscal discipline and sound economic\nmanagement, Mandela stuck to a cautious and conservative approach to\neconomic policy.\nThe slow pace of change led to increasing restlessness. Apart from two\nmeasures that Mandela swiftly introduced\u2014free health care for young children\nand pregnant mothers and primary school feeding schemes\u2014there was little\ntangible evidence of his government de - livering the improvements it had\npromised. Fewer houses were built on government initiatives in Mandela\u2019s first\nyear in office than in de Klerk\u2019s last year. Labour unions, which had helped put\nthe ANC in power, began to flex their muscles, wanting rewards for their\nendeavours. A spate of strikes and threatened strikes suggested that industrial\nstability would be difficult to achieve. Within the ANC, too, there was\nfrustration at the compromises the government was required to make. \u2018Are we in\npower or just in office?\u2019 asked Tokyo Sexwale, premier of the Gauteng region,\nthe country\u2019s industrial heartland, in November .\nMandela also had to contend with the legacy of protest politics from the\napartheid era. The culture of protest ran deep. Township residents accustomed to\nyears of boycotting rent and service charge payments in protest against apartheid\npolicies showed little inclination to start paying their dues even though a new\n\n\fgovernment was in power. Outbreaks of lawlessness were commonplace.\nStudents seized teaching staff as hostages, vandalised buildings and looted\nshops. Striking policemen set up roadblocks. Nurses deliberately spread viruses\namong their patients. Prison warders allowed dangerous criminals to escape.\nFormer MK guerrillas in the defence force absconded without leave. Taxi drivers\nblockaded central Johannesburg. Squatters invaded vacant houses. Shop workers\nwent on a looting rampage. Added to all this was an epidemic of violent crime.\nSome  policemen were killed during .\nThe scale of disorder was serious enough to prompt Mandela to read the riot\nact. Opening the second session of parliament in February , he launched\ninto a tirade against workers and students who resorted to acts of anarchy and\ndisruption to secure their demands. \u2018Let it be clear to all that the battle against\nthe forces of anarchy and chaos has been joined. Let no one say that they have\nnot been warned\u2019, he said. \u2018I speak of those who engage in such totally\nunacceptable practices as the murder of police officers, the taking of hostages,\nriots, looting, the forcible occupation of public highways, vandalisation of public\nand private property and so on\u2019. He went on, \u2018Some have misread freedom to\nmean licence . . . popular participation to mean the ability to impose chaos\u2019. But,\nhe warned, \u2018let me make abundantly clear that the small minority in our midst\nwhich wears the mask of anarchy will meet its match in the government we\nlead\u2019.\nMandela was equally blunt about those who demanded immediate benefits\nfrom his government: \u2018The government literally does not have the money to\nmeet the demands that are being advanced. Mass action of any kind will not\ncreate resources that the government does not have. All of us must rid ourselves\nof the wrong notion that the government has a big bag full of money. The\ngovernment does not have such riches. We must rid ourselves of the culture of\nentitlement which leads to the expectation that the government must promptly\ndeliver whatever it is that we demand\u2019.\nIt was a sober message to deliver after so much euphoria over the coming of\nmajority rule. What Mandela was demanding were discipline and belt-tightening\nfrom a population which had been led to expect something different.\nReflecting on the results of his first year in office, Mandela said he was\nsatisfied with the pace of change. \u2018People must be patient\u2019, he said. \u2018They must\ngive us time\u2019. Yet there was a noticeable lack of decisiveness about Mandela\u2019s\n\n\fadministration, a lack of urgency in determining priorities and tackling them, a\ntendency to let government business drift. It was as though the sheer size of the\nagenda it faced was too daunting. For those hoping for faster results, there was a\ngrowing sense of disillusionment.\n\nThe advances that Mandela made in pursuing national reconciliation were far\nmore immediate. National reconciliation became his personal crusade. From the\nmoment of his inauguration as president, he strove to establish a new racial\naccord, constantly reassuring the white minority of its well-being under majority\nrule. Addressing a huge crowd on the lawns below Union Buildings on\ninauguration day, he urged a spirit of forgiveness. \u2018Wat is verby is verby\u2019, he\nsaid in Afrikaans. \u2018What is past is past\u2019.\nTowards his old political adversaries, he remained magnanimous. He\ndescribed de Klerk as \u2018one of the greatest sons of Africa\u2019, praising him for his\ncontribution to establishing democracy. Mandela had kind words for P. W.\nBotha, \u2018a first-class gentleman\u2019, he said, \u2018the real forerunner, paving the way for\neventual negotiations\u2019. Every year, Mandela made the point of phoning Botha on\nhis birthday to wish him many happy returns. When asked by a television\ninterviewer who his hero was, he nominated former prisons minister Kobie\nCoetsee, explaining that Coetsee had chosen to meet him at a time when\ngovernment enmity towards the ANC was at a peak. Coetsee was duly rewarded\nunder the new dispensation by being named president of the senate.\nMandela was assiduous in cultivating right-wing politicians, determined to\navert the risk of right-wing resistance. He developed his warm relationship with\nGeneral Viljoen, grateful for the role he had played in helping to keep right-wing\nextremists inside the political process in the run-up to the election. In parliament,\nViljoen\u2019s small band of Freedom Front members duly became Mandela\u2019s most\nloyal opposition. Viljoen spoke of \u2018the great mutual trust and regard\u2019 between\nhimself and Mandela. Mandela also made approaches to the recalcitrant white\nConservative Party, which had boycotted the election, and invited its leader,\nFerdi Hartzenberg, for a series of talks. Even the extremist Afrikaner\nWeerstandsbeweging was included in discussions with government ministers.\nWhen the Volkstaat Council began its deliberations soon after the election in\n, it was accorded due recognition.\nThe gestures of goodwill he made were manifold. In his opening address to\n\n\fthe new parliament in Cape Town, he recited a moving poem by an Afrikaner\npoet, Ingrid Jonker, who had committed suicide in , noting how her dream\nof emancipation had now been fulfilled. He spoke again in Afrikaans when\nappealing to civil servants to support reforms in government policy. In changing\nthe name of his official residence in Cape Town from Westbrook, he chose an\nAfri - kaans name, Genadendal, meaning \u2018Valley of Mercy\u2019. He made the point\nof attending a service at the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk in Pretoria, the\nchurch to which Verwoerd and Vorster, Strijdom and Malan had belonged,\nsurprised by the warmth of his reception from the congregation: \u2018If I had gone\nthere four years ago the security would have had to protect me against assault,\nagainst people who would want to kill me. This time they were there to protect\nme from being killed out of love\u2019.\nIn one particularly memorable event, he organised what he called \u2018a\nreconciliation lunch\u2019, bringing together the wives and widows of former\napartheid leaders and leading black activists. To his presidential residence in\nPretoria, Mahlamba\u2019 Ndlopfu, came the widows of John Vorster and Hans\nStrijdom, of Steve Biko and Moses Kotane. \u2018These are the wives of the heroes of\nboth sides\u2019, said Mandela, introducing his seventeen guests to the press on the\nlawn before lunch. \u2018We have fought our fights in the past. We have forgotten it\nnow. We must build a new South Africa. By attending this occasion, each one is\nputting an important brick in that new building we are putting up\u2019.\nOne of the widows he invited, Betsie Verwoerd, replied that at the age of\nninety-four she was too infirm to travel to Pretoria for the occasion, so Mandela\nmade arrangements instead to pay a courtesy call on her two weeks later at her\nhome in Orania, a town on the banks of the Orange River in the Northern Cape\nprovince which Afrikaner bittereinders had preserved as a small whites-only\ncolony.\nThe burgemeesters of Orania gathered in their Sunday best to greet Mandela\nas he arrived in an air force helicopter and conducted him to the nearby\ncommunity hall where Betsie Verwoerd, a frail, diminutive figure, was waiting\nfor him with tea and traditional koeksusters. After tea, she emerged with\nMandela to meet the press, clutching a two-page speech she had written to thank\nhim for coming. But when she tried to read it without her spectacles, she became\ndistressed. Peering over her shoulder, Mandela began softly prompting her in\nAfrikaans, a half-smile on his lips: \u2018I ask the president to consider the volkstaat\nwith sympathy and also to decide the fate of Afrikaners with wisdom\u2019. When she\n\n\fhad finished, she looked up to him towering above her with a radiant smile of\nthanks.\nEven more remarkable was the invitation to lunch he sent to Percy Yutar, the\nprosecutor in the Rivonia trial who had argued for Mandela to be given the death\nsentence and expressed regret when this did not happen. Yutar\u2019s name was still\nreviled by liberal lawyers for his conduct of the trial. But Mandela took the view\nthat Yutar had played only a \u2018small part\u2019 in a grand system driven by politicians.\nLike others who witnessed Mandela\u2019s efforts at reconciliation, Yutar was struck\nby awe at the occasion: \u2018I wonder in what other country in the world you would\nhave the head of the government inviting someone to lunch who prosecuted him\nthirty years ago. It shows the great humility of this saintly man\u2019.\nSo much attention did Mandela devote to reassuring whites that black critics\nclaimed he was making greater efforts on their behalf than on addressing black\ngrievances. Mandela brushed aside such criticism: \u2018We had to allay the fears of\nwhites to ensure the transition process took place smoothly. If we had not done\nso, the civil war that was threatening would have broken out\u2019. Reassuring\nwhites, he said, involved no cost. He pointed to opinion polls which showed that\nhis support among the white community had risen from about  per cent before\nthe election to more than  per cent, thus helping to ensure political stability.\nThe climax to Mandela\u2019s efforts came during the  Rugby World Cup\ntournament, which South Africa hosted. This was the largest sporting event in\nthe nation\u2019s history. Rugby was a sport embraced with almost religious fervour\nby Afrikaners. During the apartheid era, when South Africa was expelled from\nworld rugby, the blow to Afrikaner morale was far greater than was any\neconomic sanction or oil embargo. The black population generally ignored\nrugby, their passion being soccer. Rugby was regarded as a \u2018Boer game\u2019, a\nsymbol of white supremacy. On Robben Island, Mandela used to infuriate\nwarders by supporting any team that was playing against South Africa\u2019s national\nteam, the Springboks.\nWhen South Africa won approval to hold the  World Cup, Mandela\nbegan to take a personal interest in the event. Although there was strong pressure\nwithin the ANC to give a new name to the national team, Mandela decided\nagainst any change. He developed a warm relationship with Fran\u00e7ois Pienaar,\nthe newly appointed Springbok captain, whom he met in Union Buildings in\nPretoria in June . Pienaar confessed to reporters beforehand that he was\n\n\fnervous about meeting a man of such standing. But he emerged with Mandela\nsmiling and readily adapted to the role of ambassador for the \u2018new South Africa\u2019\nthat Mandela hoped he would be. Pienaar promised to instruct all members of his\nteam to learn and sing the words of \u2018Nkosi Sikelel\u2019 iAfrika\u2019.\nFor their team song, the Springboks adopted an old miners\u2019 song in Xhosa,\n\u2018Tshotsholoza\u2019, which was popular with soccer fans and which Mandela and his\nfellow prisoners on Robben Island used to sing when working in the lime quarry.\nAs part of their preparations for the World Cup, team members spent an hour a\nday learning the correct pronunciation of the Xhosa words. \u2018Tshotsholoza\u2019 soon\nbecame a hit in the white community.\nWhite enthusiasm for the rugby festival was overwhelming. But it was\nMandela who turned it into a national event. He arrived at the Springbok training\nground near Cape Town, gave his personal blessing to the squad, all but one of\nthem white, and urged blacks to rally behind them: \u2018We have adopted these\nyoung men as our boys, as our own children, as our own stars. This country is\nfully behind them. I have never been so proud of our boys as I am now and I\nhope that that pride we all share\u2019.\nIn the week leading up to the final match between South Africa and New\nZealand on  June, Mandela took to wearing a green rugby supporter\u2019s cap,\nadorned with the Springbok emblem. \u2018This cap does honour to our boys\u2019, he told\na black crowd. \u2018I ask you to stand by them, because they are our kind\u2019. With\nboyish enthusiasm, he visited the team at its practice fields and in its dressing\nrooms. Pienaar responded by saying he would \u2018play his heart out\u2019 for the\npresident.\nAs the team took to the field at Ellis Park, Mandela emerged on to the pitch\nwearing the green and gold number  jersey of the team captain, Pienaar, and a\nSpringbok cap, sending the overwhelmingly white crowd into a frenzy of\nenthusiasm and excitement. The stadium reverberated with chants of \u2018Nel-son!\nNel-son!\u2019\nThe match produced one of the most intense afternoons of physical endeavour\nand emotion that any of those present were ever likely to witness. At full time,\nthe two teams were locked at -, so extra time was necessary. Seven minutes\nfrom the end, a drop goal gave South Africa victory. The crowd went wild.\nPresenting Pienaar with the trophy, Mandela said, \u2018Thanks for what you have\ndone for South Africa\u2019. Pienaar replied, \u2018Thanks for what you have done to\n\n\fSouth Africa\u2019.\nThe whole of South Africa erupted in celebration, blacks as joyful as whites.\nJohannesburg became a giant street party. In the northern suburbs, domestic\nworkers rushed out on the streets shouting: \u2018We\u2019ve done it! We\u2019ve done it!\u2019\nNever before had blacks had cause to show such pride in the efforts of their\nwhite countrymen. It was a moment of national fusion that Mandela had done\nmuch to inspire.\n\nThe honeymoon period between Mandela and his partners in the government of\nnational unity, de Klerk and Buthelezi, was memorable but brief. From the\noutset, they made strange bedfellows, brought together not so much by common\ninterest as by a quirk of fate. The antagonisms of the past were too close to allow\nfor an easy relationship. De Klerk at first loyally played the part allotted to him\nas a deputy president, travelling the world, extolling the virtues of the new South\nAfrica, dutifully maintaining a low profile. But it was a role with which he\nbecame increasingly disgruntled.\nExpecting to make a considerable impact on government policy, he found he\nhad influence but no real power. All his hopes about power-sharing, of making\nimportant decisions in concert with Mandela, were soon confounded. Mandela\nlistened, but pursued his own agenda. Nor did de Klerk acquire the leverage he\nexpected to command by acting as the guardian of white interests in the civil\nservice, the police and the business community. White civil servants rapidly\nswitched their allegiance to Mandela, accepting him, rather than de Klerk, as the\nguarantor of their interests. The police hierarchy, swiftly reshuffled, followed\nsuit. With the business community, Mandela opened his own direct lines of\ncommunications. As an intermediary representing white interests, de Klerk was\nsoon redundant.\nHe also found himself at odds with Mandela in dealing with the past. Mandela\nwas determined that human rights violations during the apartheid era should be\ninvestigated, not for the purpose of exacting retribution, but with the aim of\nproviding some form of public accounting and helping purge the injustices of the\npast. Unless past crimes were addressed, he said, they would \u2018live with us like a\nfestering sore\u2019. He proposed to establish a truth and reconciliation commission,\nempowered to subpoena witnesses and to grant amnesties. Those who came\nforward to make a full admission of their crimes would receive pardons.\n\n\fOtherwise, they risked the possibility of prosecution in the courts. The\ncommission would then make \u2018recommendations on steps to be taken to ensure\nthat such violations never take place again\u2019. De Klerk said the proposal would\nresult in \u2018a witch-hunt\u2019, focusing attention upon past government abuses while\nignoring ANC crimes. It was likely to \u2018tear out the stitches of wounds that are\nbeginning to heal\u2019. But his rearguard action against it achieved nothing.\nGhosts from the past continued to haunt the new government. A former\npoliceman testified that the bombing of the Johannesburg headquarters of the\nSouth African Council of Churches in  had been carried out, not by the\nANC, as the government had claimed at the time, but by government agents who\nwere subsequently congratulated by the minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok.\nUnder pressure to prosecute, the police commissioner was obliged to disclose in\nJanuary  that two former ministers, Adriaan Vlok and former defence\nminister Magnus Malan, together with , policemen, had secretly been\ngranted indemnities by de Klerk\u2019s government in its last days in power before\nthe general election in April .\nThe disclosure caused outrage. At a cabinet meeting at Union Buildings on \nJanuary, de Klerk attempted to deny all knowledge of the matter. After a\nprotracted discussion, the cabinet decided to declare the indemnities invalid. But\njust when agreement on the issue appeared to have been reached, Mandela, who\nhad been sitting quietly listening to the proceedings, launched a ferocious\npersonal attack on de Klerk, all the old animosity he had felt towards him\nresurfacing. What particularly incensed Mandela was not just the covert nature\nof the indemnity deal but also the manner in which de Klerk disclaimed any\nresponsibility for it, just as he had always done with Mandela in past disputes\nover government complicity in violence. Mandela came close to calling de Klerk\na liar, rejecting the denial he made, and went on to criticise his conduct in\ncabinet, comparing it unfavourably to that of other National Party ministers. In\ncabinet, said Mandela, de Klerk spoke in a manner in which \u2018white men used to\nspeak to blacks\u2019. As Mandela continued his attack, de Klerk gathered up his\npapers, preparing to walk out, saying he would have to reconsider his position.\nMandela retorted that if de Klerk did withdraw, it \u2018would not cause a ripple\u2019.\nAfter the meeting had adjourned, ministers from both sides rallied round,\nhoping to find a way to achieve rapprochement. De Klerk declared he had been\n\u2018viciously insulted\u2019. He accused the ANC of becoming increasingly intolerant of\nopposition and criticism; its members, he said, \u2018tend more and more to become\n\n\fimpatient and to adopt a bully attitude when they are opposed and questioned\u2019.\nBut he was nevertheless willing to compromise. When Mandela suggested that\nthey should make \u2018a fresh start\u2019, de Klerk accepted. It seemed unlikely, however,\nthat the coalition would survive its full term. De Klerk was no longer\nindispensable.\nThere were other sources of friction, notably over the conduct of South\nAfrica\u2019s foreign policy. Despite the overwhelming need to attract Western\ninvestment, Mandela persisted with an approach which emphasised friendship\nwith countries such as Libya, Cuba and Iran that was likely to deter Western\ninterest. Foreign policy was frequently an area of confusion and muddle,\ndetermined as much by which governments had made contributions to the ANC\ntreasury as by other factors. \u2018Our foreign policy is largely for hire\u2019, complained\nthe opposition Democratic Party. \u2018If you make a substantial donation to the\nANC, you get special foreign policy consideration\u2019. The foreign minister, Alfred\nNzo, an old friend of Mandela\u2019s, became a figure of public ridicule, universally\ncriticised for incompetence. Blunders were commonplace. Mandela added to the\ntoll, describing US aid of $ million in  as \u2018peanuts\u2019. The result was to\nsquander much of the goodwill for South Africa retained in Western capitals and\nto exacerbate tensions with de Klerk.\nThe final rift with de Klerk came during negotiations over the drafting of the\nnew constitution in . De Klerk fought hard to secure a clause enshrining the\nprinciple of a forced coalition on a permanent basis. When he failed to get his\nway, he decided to withdraw from the government altogether, giving vent to his\nfrustration at the minor role he had been obliged to play. \u2018We felt for some time\nnow that our influence in the government of national unity has been declining\u2019,\nhe said in May , after the new constitution had been finalised. \u2018The ANC\nwas acting more and more as if they no longer needed a multiparty government\u2019.\nHe spoke of the need to provide \u2018a strong and vigilant opposition\u2019. Mandela\nmade it clear that he would have preferred the National Party to remain in the\ncoalition, but otherwise he accepted de Klerk\u2019s departure with equanimity. As\nMandela had predicted, it caused barely a ripple.\n\nMandela\u2019s relationship with Buthelezi was far more fractious. Appointed\nminister of home affairs in , Buthelezi was constantly at loggerheads with\nMandela over Inkatha\u2019s continuing campaign for greater regional autonomy for\n\n\fKwaZulu-Natal. The dispute was made more complex by the role of the Zulu\nking, Goodwill Zwelethini, whose decision to switch his support to Mandela just\nbefore the election earned him Buthelezi\u2019s lasting enmity. In a spectacular\ndisplay of wild behaviour in September , Buthelezi and his bodyguards\nbarged into a television studio in Johannesburg and during a live discussion\nprogramme began abusing and threatening a Zulu prince speaking on the king\u2019s\nbehalf.\nIn the ensuing uproar, rather than force the minister\u2019s resignation, Mandela\nsubjected Buthelezi to public humiliation, requiring him to apologise to the\ncabinet and the nation. As Buthelezi sat alongside him, looking penitent,\nMandela read out a statement he had drawn up after a special session of the\ncabinet: \u2018The cabinet resolved that this action constituted a serious violation of\nthe right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press. It also posed a threat to\nthe safety and security of citizens. It was therefore a direct challenge to the very\nconstitution which all ministers of the government are sworn to protect and\nrespect. Accordingly, the cabinet passed a motion of severe censure on Dr\nButhelezi for conduct inimical to good government and the protection of\nfundamental human rights\u2019.\nButhelezi duly apologised after explaining that he had not realised the\nprogramme was being broadcast live: \u2018I am not such a bumbling fool that I\nwould go into a live studio and interfere with a programme deliberately\u2019.\nFor months on end, a row simmered between Mandela and Buthelezi over the\nquestion of international mediation on Inkatha\u2019s demands for greater regional\nautonomy in KwaZulu-Natal. Although Mandela had given a commitment\nagreeing to international mediation in April  in order to get Buthelezi to\nparticipate in the election, once in power, Mandela failed to honour it, making a\nvariety of excuses. Hoping to embarrass Mandela over this \u2018breach of trust\u2019,\nButhelezi reverted to his favourite tactic of boycott, announcing Inkatha\u2019s\nwithdrawal from parliament and the constitutional assembly in February .\nThe boycott had little impact, and two weeks later Buthelezi ended it on the\npretext of allowing more time for negotiation. A month later, when no further\nprogress had been made in resolving the dispute, he suspended Inkatha\u2019s\nparticipation in the constitutional assembly.\nOn both sides, the war of words became increasingly reckless, threatening to\nre-ignite large-scale violence. In April, Buthelezi called on KwaZulu-Natal to\n\n\f\u2018rise and resist\u2019 the central government over its refusal to negotiate greater\nregional autonomy. People should be prepared to lay down their lives to\nsafeguard self-determination against the ANC\u2019s \u2018arrogance\u2019 over the issue of\ninternational mediation and the constitution. \u2018Let the new struggle for freedom\nbegin. Let our friends and foes be warned that our march to freedom has begun\u2019,\nhe said. \u2018No amount of intimidation, prevarication and violence can bend into\nsubmission the strength of Inkatha, or undermine our determination to defend\nour self-determination, freedom and pluralism\u2019.\nMandela responded in kind, throwing all caution to the wind. At a rally near\nDurban, he accused Inkatha of using government funds for KwaZulu-Natal to\nfoment rebellion there and threatened to cut them off. His remarks were\ndenounced by opposition groups as being irresponsible, inflammatory and\nunconstitutional. When Mandela\u2019s advisers sought to defuse the crisis by\nstressing the president would take no action that was unconstitutional, Mandela\nweighed in further by saying that if he did not possess the power to cut off funds,\nhe would acquire it if necessary by amending the constitution.\nThe crisis blew over a day later when Mandela and Buthelezi met and agreed\nto settle their differences in an orderly manner. Appearing in front of the media\nafterwards, they smiled and joked for the benefit of the cameras. Mandela\ndescribed Buthelezi as \u2018my traditional leader, my chief, and my prince\u2019.\nButhelezi declared himself \u2018a loyal member of the president\u2019s cabinet\u2019. He\nremained in Mandela\u2019s cabinet long after de Klerk had departed.\nBut the episode raised questions once again about Mandela\u2019s judgement. By\nrefusing to fulfil his commitment to international mediation, he provided\nButhelezi with a legitimate grievance that he was bound to exploit. The verdict\nof the press on the issue was overwhelmingly hostile to Mandela. By then\nresorting to the same kind of threats and bluster that Buthelezi habitually used to\nfurther his aims, Mandela risked setting off renewed violence in KwaZulu-Natal\nand undermining South Africa\u2019s political stability, upon which so much else\ndepended. It was an example of impetuous brinkmanship which South Africa\ncould ill afford.\n"
