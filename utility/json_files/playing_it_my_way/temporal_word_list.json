    "1984-1988": " CHILDHOOD\n\n\u2018Son, life is like a book. It has numerous chapters. It also has many a lesson in it. It is made up of a\nwide variety of experiences and resembles a pendulum where success and failure, joy and sorrow are\nmerely extremes of the central reality. The lessons to be learnt from success and failure are equally\nimportant. More often than not, failure and sorrow are bigger teachers than success and happiness.\nYou are a cricketer and sportsman. You are fortunate to be representing your country, and that is a\ngreat honour. But never forget that this too is just another chapter in the book. Typically, let\u2019s say a\nperson lives for seventy or eighty years or so. How many years will you play sport? Twenty years; if\nyou are very good, maybe even twenty-five years. Even by that yardstick, you will live the majority of\nyour years outside the sphere of professional sport. This clearly means that there is more to life than\ncricket. I am asking you, son, to keep a pleasant disposition and maintain a balanced nature. Do not\nallow success to breed arrogance in you. If you remain humble, people will give you love and respect\neven after you have finished with the game. As a parent, I would be happier hearing people say,\n\u201cSachin is a good human being\u201d than \u201cSachin is a great cricketer\u201d any day.\u2019\nMy father\u2019s words, which I often heard while growing up, encapsulate my life\u2019s philosophy.\nI was born to a very close-knit Maharashtrian family in Mumbai\u2019s Bandra East and lived in the\nSahitya Sahawas colony, a residential co-operative for writers. I am one of four children, with two\nbrothers and a sister. Nitin, Ajit and Savita are all older than me, and not only am I the youngest in the\nfamily but I was also the worst behaved.\nMy father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was an acclaimed Marathi poet, critic and professor, while my\nmother, Rajani, worked for the Life Insurance Corporation of India. Humility and modesty were their\nhallmarks and I owe a lot of my personality to my upbringing. Despite all my unreasonableness and\nall the embarrassments I caused them, my parents never gave up on me. In fact, I have often wondered\njust how they managed to cope with such a naughty child. Though he must have been pushed to the\nlimits sometimes, my father would never shout at me and was always patient when dealing with my\nmischief. This added to my respect for my father as I grew older. Losing him during the  World\nCup in England remains one of the most traumatic moments of my life and I will forever remain\nindebted to him for helping me become the human being that I am.\nMy mother, the best cook in the world for me, will do anything to see a smile on my face. She used\nto make the most delicious fish and prawn curry, baigan bharta and varan bhaat (lentils and rice) for\nus at home, and I owe my appetite and love of food to her. I fondly remember lying on her lap after\neating delicious home-cooked meals, as she sang the most beautiful songs while trying to get me off\nto sleep. Listening to her while dozing off at the end of the day instilled in me a love for music that\nhas remained with me to this day.\nMy brothers, Nitin and Ajit, have always backed me in my endeavours and, on the cricket side, I\nowe a lot to Ajit, who is ten years older than me and was a good club cricketer himself but decided to\n\n\fsacrifice his own career to help me achieve my potential. As I said in my farewell speech after my\nfinal Test, Ajit and I lived the dream together and he was always my most trusted critic and sounding\nboard. I may have scored the runs, but Ajit was always there with me in spirit, trying to put me right\nwhenever I made a mistake. Even after my last Test innings, we had a discussion about how I had got\nout and what I had done wrong, despite knowing I\u2019d never play for India again. Ajit is not just my\nbrother, but my closest friend as well. He was always available when I needed him and always put my\ncricket before his own work.\nMy eldest brother, Nitin, easily the most creative of the siblings, was the strict disciplinarian in the\nTendulkar household and helped rein in my exuberance when my mother had almost given up on me.\nHe not only sketches really well, but is also an accomplished writer and poet and has recently written\nsongs for a movie. Nitin, initially a chemistry teacher, subsequently worked for Air India and I\nremember on one occasion, when I was ten, his flight was delayed and he had to wait at the Centaur\n(now Sahara Star) hotel in Mumbai. Ajit and I went to have dinner in his room and for the first time in\nmy life I tasted tandoori chicken, which subsequently became one of my favourite dishes.\nSavita, my sister, gave me my first cricket bat. She travelled to Kashmir for a holiday when I was\nfive and brought me back a Kashmir willow bat. She is easily the calmest of the siblings and has a\nvery reserved and composed demeanour. She stays unruffled in difficult situations and we often\nconsulted her on critical matters while growing up. When she got married, I, not knowing much about\nrituals and customs, tried to insist that my brother-in-law should come and stay with us rather than\nSavita having to go away. I did not want to let her go and I must say I missed her terribly when she\nleft home.\n\nNever sitting still\nUndoubtedly I had a fascinating childhood. My early years were never boring; in fact, quite the\nopposite. I can trace a lot of the stamina and inner strength that sustained me during my cricket career\nto those early years, which were full of fun.\nWe had moved to Sahitya Sahawas in . In my growing-up years, there was a great deal of\nconstruction work taking place there. This gave me and my friends the opportunity to play quite a few\npranks on our neighbours. While we were never violent and never caused bodily harm to others, I\u2019m\nashamed to admit we sometimes enjoyed having a laugh at the expense of other members of the\ncolony. For us it was fun, plain and simple, but looking back at some of the mischief we got up to now\nis rather embarrassing.\nOne of our regular tricks was to dig a deep hole in the sand left behind by the contractors and cover\nit with newspapers before disguising it with sand. Then we\u2019d deliberately lure people to walk over it.\nAs they sank into the crater, we\u2019d be in fits of laughter. Another was to pour water on unsuspecting\npassers-by from our apartment on the fourth floor, and I remember that feasting on mangoes picked\nfrom trees we weren\u2019t supposed to touch was also a favourite pastime. The forbidden nature of the act\nmade it even more compelling and the complaints that would follow did little to put us off. Finally \u2013\nand this is very embarrassing, looking back now \u2013 my friends and I would take pride in locking people\nin their flats. It wasn\u2019t dangerous, but the resulting delay, which must have caused them immense\nfrustration, seemed very funny at the time.\nAs a child I was first enrolled at the Indian Education Society\u2019s New English School in Bandra. I\nwas a reasonable student and though I was never a class-topper, I did not languish at the bottom either.\nWhile school wasn\u2019t altogether boring, the best time of the year was the two-month-long summer\n\n\fbreak. During the holiday period, I\u2019d hurry down from our apartment at  a.m. and would be out in the\nsun playing for the rest of the day. The domestic help, Lakshmibai, (a common phenomenon in\nhouseholds where both parents were working) would have to bring down my glass of milk and\nsometimes she would also have to bring out my lunch, because I\u2019d refuse to go up to our apartment.\nThe sweltering heat was never a distraction and I\u2019d be out playing till late in the evening. In fact,\neven after most of my friends had disappeared to their apartments, I would be out alone trying to\namuse myself. There were seven or eight blocks in the colony and sometimes I\u2019d just run around them\nto expend energy. I\u2019d run seven or eight laps on the trot and do so barefoot. Only when my brother\nNitin instructed me to go up would I rush back. I was a little scared of him. He generally didn\u2019t say\nmuch to me but when he did it was always the final word. If my mother grew tired of trying to\npersuade me to come in, she would ask Nitin to perform the task.\nIn our two-bedroom apartment, the four children would all sleep together in one of the bedrooms. I\nwas always the last one to drop off and would keep tossing and turning as the others drifted off. Often,\nwhile they\u2019d be lying north\u2013south, I\u2019d end up stretched out east\u2013west, and I\u2019d receive a mouthful when\nthey woke up to find me lying across them. The reprimands were part of the bonding and I never took\nthem to heart. The whole experience brought us closer together.\n\nA first taste of Chinese food\nAs a child I loved food. I grew up eating my mother\u2019s wonderful Maharashtrian home cooking and it\nwasn\u2019t till I was nine years old that I first tried Chinese food. In the early s Chinese cuisine was\nbecoming popular in Mumbai and, having heard so much about it, my colony friends made a plan to\ngo out for a meal together. We each contributed ten rupees \u2013 which was a lot of money for me at the\ntime \u2013 and I was excited about trying something new. The evening, however, turned out to be a\ndisaster as I paid the price for being one of the youngest in the group.\nIn the restaurant we ordered chicken and sweetcorn soup as a starter. We were sitting at a long table\nand by the time the soup travelled to me at the far end, there was hardly anything left. The older\nmembers of the gang had finished off most of it, leaving very little for us younger ones. The same\nthing happened with the fried rice and chow mein and I barely managed to get two spoonfuls of each.\nThe older boys had a great evening at our expense but I returned home hungry and thirsty.\n\nDreaming of a bicycle\nAs I kid I could also be quite obstinate. While most of my friends had their own bicycles, I did not and\nI was determined to have one. My father didn\u2019t really like saying no to me and tried to placate me by\nsaying he\u2019d buy me one in a few weeks. From a financial point of view, it wasn\u2019t easy to bring up four\nchildren in Mumbai, but our parents never let us feel any pressure. Not knowing what they had to go\nthrough, I remained determined to have my bicycle and refused to go outside and play till I had a new\none to show off. It seems a little ridiculous now, but the truth is I didn\u2019t go out to play for a whole\nweek. I just stood on the balcony and sulked and tried to guilt-trip my parents into buying me a\nbicycle.\nIt was on one of these days that I gave them a real scare. Ours was a fourth-floor apartment with a\nsmall balcony with a grille. As a small child, I couldn\u2019t see over the top and, with curiosity often\ngetting the better of me, I would try to get my head through the grille. On this occasion it resulted in\ndisaster. While I succeeded in pushing my head through, I couldn\u2019t get it back in and was stuck there\n\n\ffor more than thirty minutes. My parents were flustered to start with, but quickly regained composure.\nAfter plenty of oil was squirted on my head, my mother finally pulled me out.\nSeeing my desperation and worried about what I might get up to next, my father rearranged his\nfinances to buy me a brand-new bicycle. I still don\u2019t know what adjustments he had to make to do so.\nNor was I concerned at the time. All I cared about was the bicycle and I immediately showed it off to\nall my friends. However, my joy was short-lived as I met with a serious accident within hours of\ngetting my precious new bicycle. A fruit and vegetable seller pushing a cart had come to the colony.\nAs we came face to face, I was riding too fast and couldn\u2019t slow down in time. New to the bicycle, I\napplied the wrong brake and, bang, I hit the cart head on, lost control and was tossed into the air. As I\nlooked down on the world, my only concern was what would happen to my new bicycle. When I came\ncrashing back down, one of the spokes went through the skin just above my right eye. The cut was\ndeep and blood was gushing out of the wound. Far more importantly, my bicycle was badly damaged.\nNews soon reached home that I had hurt myself and my parents were very concerned. I tried to be\nbrave and made out that it was only a minor wound. It wasn\u2019t, and my father had to take me to a\nplastic surgeon friend of his, who put eight stitches just above the right eye. He gave me a couple of\ninjections and I returned home feeling sorry for myself and frustrated. My mangled bicycle was\nparked close to our apartment, but my father told me that I wasn\u2019t allowed near it until the wound had\nhealed and that he\u2019d get it repaired in the interim. This time I had to give in, knowing it was the only\nway I\u2019d get it back.\nAs soon as I\u2019d recovered, I resumed cycling, and within a few months had become an accomplished\nbiker. I could slow-cycle better than most kids and even went on to win a race organized in the colony.\nI rode with passion and within a few months had developed the ability to slide on one wheel, which\ntook all my friends by surprise. In areas of the colony where there was sand on the concrete, I could\nget the wheels to slide for ten to fifteen feet, with my body bent at forty-five degrees. I wasn\u2019t\nbothered about what this was doing to the tyres, of course, as the larger the distance covered, the better\nI felt. Showing off my skills used to give me a thrill and what added to the fun was that I had learnt\nthese tricks in quick time.\nNevertheless, things went wrong sometimes, causing me plenty of embarrassment and pain. In fact,\nI think I can trace my ability to withstand pain to my exploits as a child. I\u2019d often get cut or hurt but\nrarely mentioned these minor accidents to anyone at home. So much so that my father got into the\nhabit of examining my body when I was sleeping to check whether I\u2019d injured myself. If he saw me\nwince in pain, he\u2019d know I\u2019d done something to myself again and he would take me to the doctor the\nnext day.\nNo matter what I\u2019d done, though, my father would never shout or scream at me. More often than\nnot, he\u2019d try to set out the reasons why I should or shouldn\u2019t do certain things, and his explanations\nleft behind a lasting impact. My father\u2019s sense of reason was his biggest virtue and I try to act in the\nsame way with my children.\n\nIn the wars again\nI had a lot of adventures as a child, but one that stands out is when I was cut under my eye while\nplaying at Shivaji Park, the breeding ground of cricketers in Mumbai, and had to return home covered\nin blood. I was captaining my team in a match at Shivaji Park when I was twelve and after our\nwicketkeeper got injured I asked my team-mates if anyone could keep wicket. No one volunteered and\nsomewhat reluctantly I stepped up to the challenge, even though I\u2019d never tried it before. I was\n\n\funcomfortable standing in the unfamiliar position behind the stumps and soon missed a nick. The ball\ncame at me fast and, even before I could react, it hit me smack in the face, just missing my eye. The\ncut was deep and there was a lot of blood.\nI didn\u2019t have the money to pay for a taxi home and was embarrassed at the thought of getting on a\nbus with a bloodied face. I asked a friend of mine to give me a lift on his bicycle, and anyone who\nknows Mumbai will realize what a difficult task that is, especially with heavy cricket kitbags in tow.\nThere was a busy flyover between East and West Bandra, which my friend found too steep with such a\nheavy load. As a result, I had to get off and walk, with commuters gaping at me in shock. A young kid\nwith a bloodied face and bloodstained shirt lugging his cricket kit over a flyover wasn\u2019t an everyday\nsight.\nWhen I got home, I was relieved to find my parents out at work. My grandmother was in the\napartment, but I asked her not to panic and told her it was a minor injury. She said she knew how to\nhandle it and put warm turmeric over the cut, an age-old Indian Ayurvedic treatment for cuts and\nbruises. I did not bother telling anyone else and the injury healed faster than I expected.\nSuffice to say, that wasn\u2019t the only time I got hurt while playing cricket as a kid. Injuries were\nfrequent because we played on half-baked and overused pitches and our coach insisted we should bat\nwithout helmets and learn to leave balls by swaying out of the way. On such wickets, injuries were a\ncertainty, but they hardened us for the grind in the future and as a result I was never scared of getting\nhurt. It was all part of being a professional sportsman. However, the ability to withstand pain didn\u2019t\nmean I didn\u2019t take due precautions and exposed myself to injuries unnecessarily \u2013 something I was\nonce surprised to be questioned about as a fourteen-year-old during a match at the Wankhede Stadium.\nThe match, which involved Mumbai\u2019s Ranji Trophy Probables, started early in the morning and the\nplan was for a pair of fast bowlers to bowl at the batsmen for five or six overs before they were rested\nand a new pair were asked to bowl with a new ball. The aim was to give batsmen practice against a\nfast swinging ball. To make things even more difficult, a lot of grass had been left on the track. I went\nout to bat early in our innings and was wearing my Under- cap. I didn\u2019t have a helmet at the time\nand the Under- cap was the only headgear I possessed. Raju Kulkarni, who was by then an\naccomplished Test bowler for India, was livid when he saw me taking guard in just a cap. All the\nsenior batsmen had helmets, so how dare I, a fourteen-year-old, wander out without proper head\nprotection? At first, I couldn\u2019t work out why he was so upset. He bowled a barrage of bouncers \u2013\nthough in hindsight I realize they were intended to teach me a lesson rather than to hurt me \u2013 but I\nmanaged to stay calm enough to sway out of the way. When I finally understood the reason behind his\nanger, I did not know how to explain to him that Achrekar Sir had not allowed me to wear a helmet in\nschool cricket \u2013 I wasn\u2019t attempting to be brave at all. It was only later, when I was selected in the\nMumbai team and came to know Raju well, that I finally told him the real reason for not wearing a\nhelmet.\n\nMusic: my second love\nMusic was a constant presence in the Tendulkar household. All my siblings would regularly listen to\nthe radio and always followed the weekly Hindi film music programme Binaca Geetmala (Garland of\nsongs), anchored by the well-known radio personality Ameen Sayani. As a result, while I was too\nyoung to understand much, I was exposed to music from a very early age. The exposure increased\nwhen my father bought a cassette player, which miraculously allowed everyone to listen to music of\ntheir choice. Both my brothers were fans of the famous ghazal singer Pankaj Udhas. I couldn\u2019t really\n\n\fappreciate his songs then, but I was always in the room when they were played and was privy to\ndiscussions on the nuances and finer points of music. On one occasion Nitin went to Dubai and\nbrought back Pankaj Udhas\u2019s newly released album. Even though he didn\u2019t get home till midnight, we\nall waited up to listen to the cassette as soon as he got back, with our grandmother making us tea well\npast one in the morning.\nIt was natural that music should soon become my second love after cricket and it has remained that\nway ever since. I enjoy listening to all kinds of Indian music, ranging from film songs to the more\nclassical variety, and I always feel relaxed with my headphones on. Later, during tours abroad, I began\nto pick up on Western music and I now love listening to Pink Floyd, U, Dire Straits and a host of\nothers. I passed that taste for Western music on to Ajit, and it is now an important feature of the\nTendulkar household.\n\nTurning to cricket\nBesides cricket and music, I was also a big fan of tennis as a child. John McEnroe, the legendary\nAmerican player, was my favourite. As a ten-year-old I would mimic McEnroe\u2019s look and antics, to\nthe extent that I grew my hair into a curly mop and walked around wearing a headband. I was\nfascinated by the battles between Bj\u00f6rn Borg and McEnroe and for a while I even contemplated\nchoosing tennis over cricket.\nAjit knew about my obsession with tennis but had also seen me play cricket with my colony friends.\nHe had observed my natural bat swing and that\u2019s what led him to believe that I might turn out to be a\ngood batsman if groomed properly \u2013 though he never imposed anything on me.\nWhat he would do is give me both a tennis racket and a cricket bat and take me up to the terrace to\nhave a hit. He threw tennis balls to me while I took turns at tennis and cricket. We didn\u2019t have too\nmany balls then and if they bounced over the walls of the terrace, I would quickly run down four\nfloors and fetch them (there were no elevators then, something that explains the secret behind my\nstrong legs!). It was clear to Ajit that I enjoyed myself far more while playing cricket. However, the\nepisode that led him to take the next step and bring me along to Ramakant Achrekar\u2019s summer cricket\ncamp in , at the age of eleven, had nothing to do with cricket.\nThe turn to cricket was prompted by a group of friends \u2013 myself, Sunil Harshe and Avinash\nGowariker \u2013 getting into a spot of trouble. At the time in India Doordarshan, the national broadcaster,\nwould show a classic film every Sunday, and on this fateful day it was Guide, starring Dev Anand, one\nof India\u2019s legendary actors. Most of the residents of our colony were engrossed in the film, allowing\nus three the opportunity to climb up one of the trees and take some mangoes. Sunil, who was on the\nheavy side, and I were on a branch together, but it broke and we fell with a crash from quite a height.\nAs we got up and tried to run away, we were caught and brought to book. It was evident that\nsomething needed to be done to channel my energies, especially during the school summer holidays.\nRamakant Achrekar\u2019s coaching camp, where a lot of Mumbai\u2019s top cricketers had learnt their game,\nwas Ajit\u2019s answer. LEARNING THE GAME\n\nFrom a very early age I played tennis-ball cricket with my colony friends. I loved watching cricket on\ntelevision and in our games I often tried to emulate the mannerisms of my favourite players, Sunil\nGavaskar and the West Indian legend Viv Richards. But it wasn\u2019t just the batsmen that I studied. I also\nloved bowling and tried my hand at different kinds of deliveries \u2013 medium pace, off-spin and leg-spin\n\u2013 all with a tennis ball, of course. I even experimented with tactics like the slower ball and bowling\nfrom wide of the stump. Throughout my career I have actually bowled a lot in the nets. As soon as I\u2019d\nfinished with my batting I\u2019d pick up a ball and start bowling to whichever batsmen were around at the\ntime.\nThe transition from playing with a tennis ball to playing with a cricket ball happened under the\nwatchful eyes of Ramakant Achrekar, then cricket coach at Shardashram Vidyamandir school.\nAchrekar Sir, as I refer to him, started playing cricket at the age of eleven in , which is the age I\nwas when I went to him for the first time. He played for a number of Mumbai clubs, including the Gul\nMohar Mills and Mumbai Port, and played a first-class match for the State Bank of India against\nHyderabad in . When I was growing up he was undoubtedly one of the most accomplished\ncoaches in Mumbai.\nFrom his own schooldays at Balmohan Vidyamandir, my brother Ajit knew that compared to other\nschools in Mumbai, Shardashram was by far the best organized in its approach to cricket, and that\u2019s\nwhy he took me along to Achrekar Sir\u2019s nets in Shivaji Park to try my luck at being a part of his\nsummer camp.\nAnyone could come for a trial at the camp but then it was up to Sir to decide who to accept. There\nwere nets for players from all age groups, starting with the sub-junior (Under-) and junior (Under) levels. I was eleven years old and trialled at the sub-junior nets to start with. The Mumbai Cricket\nAssociation had an Under- team and most candidates from the sub-junior section eventually vied\nfor a position in that team.\nI had never batted in nets before and felt somewhat overawed with so many people around. When I\nwas asked to bat, I was not at all comfortable. With Sir watching me so closely, I failed to make an\nimpact. After I had finished batting, Sir called Ajit aside and informed him that I was perhaps too\nyoung to make the camp and suggested that he should bring me back when I was a little older. I wasn\u2019t\nparty to this conversation and had no idea what was discussed at the time. My induction into the\nMumbai cricket circuit could have ended in failure \u2013 but for Ajit\u2019s insistence.\nHaving seen me play in the colony, Ajit knew I was capable of performing far better than I had in\nfront of Achrekar Sir. He explained that I was nervous and asked Sir to give me one more opportunity.\nHowever, he suggested that while doing so Sir should pretend to go away and then watch from a\ndistance. Sir agreed. Before long I was asked to bat again and, without Sir\u2019s trained eyes scrutinizing\nme \u2013 or so I thought \u2013 I felt more at ease and soon started to hit the ball well. This time, Sir agreed to\n\n\flet me join the camp. I was delighted and I must say it was an opportunity that transformed my life.\nParticipants in the summer camp had to pay an admission fee of  rupees (less than a pound) and a\nmonthly fee of  rupees ( pence). In my case I don\u2019t remember having to pay the monthly fee after\nthe first few months. The camp involved a session every morning and evening at Shivaji Park. I would\npractise between . a.m. and . a.m. before making my way home for lunch, then I\u2019d come back\nin the afternoon and train till late evening. The schedule was rigorous and I would be exhausted by the\nend of the day. Travelling to Shivaji Park took forty minutes from my house in Bandra and I had to\ncatch an early-morning bus to make it on time.\nFor the first few days Ajit accompanied me, to get me used to the routine, but once I was familiar\nwith the journey, I\u2019d travel to the camp on my own. During the bus journeys he would talk to me about\nthe nuances of batting, and I always enjoyed these conversations a lot. In fact, the one thing that I have\nkept with me all my career is a note that Ajit gave me containing some thoughts about batting. It\nserved as a very personal coaching manual.\nAs a child I had only one set of cricket clothes and the routine was to wash them as soon as I\u2019d\nreturned from the morning session. While I had my lunch, the clothes would dry out in the sun and I\nwould wear them again in the afternoon. The pattern was repeated in the evening, so that I could use\nthe same set of clothes the following morning. The system worked well \u2013 apart from my pockets.\nThere was never quite enough time for the pockets to dry out completely and for the entire duration of\nthe camp I played with wet pockets.\n\nChanging schools\nBy the middle of the summer camp, Sir had started taking an active interest in my batting and at the\nend of the two months informed Ajit that I had the potential to be a good cricketer if I practised all\nyear round. He had made a few changes to the way I batted and the impact was immediate. I was now\npractising with the older boys from the junior section. However, my school \u2013 the New English School\nin Bandra \u2013 did not have cricket facilities and Sir was keen for me to change schools if I wanted to\npursue cricket seriously.\nOne evening Sir called my father and asked if he would speak to me about changing schools. Ajit\nwas in the room with my father at the time and they both accepted that it was necessary, if cricket was\nto be my priority. However, neither of them ever forced anything on me and when I got home they\nasked me what I thought of the suggestion. By that time I had started enjoying my batting and was\nkeen to play throughout the year. Without any hesitation I agreed to the move. My father sat me down\nand explained that while he did not have any objections to me changing schools, I should do so only if\nI was really serious about playing cricket. I assured him I was, and so it was agreed that I should move\nto Shardashram Vidyamandir, where Achrekar Sir was a cricket coach.\nThe move meant I lost contact with a lot of my New English school friends, but I soon made new\nones at Shardashram, mostly through cricket. All the cricketers in the school were friends with each\nother and even though we were in different divisions and sections, such things hardly mattered. We\nplayed together during lunch breaks and discussed cricket all the time, and Achrekar Sir would coach\nus after school. Cricket was fast becoming my first love. All my excess energies were getting\nchannelled into cricket, which acted as a kind of a safety valve. Everyone at home was very\nsupportive, but my father always said that all he wanted me to do was give it my best effort without\nworrying about the results.\nJoining Shardashram undoubtedly helped my cricket a great deal. It allowed me the opportunity to\n\n\fplay competitive matches regularly and my game rapidly improved as a result. There\u2019s nothing like\nplaying matches to get better, because only in competitive situations are you forced to out-think the\nopposition and improvise. Net practice can never be a substitute for matchplay and Achrekar Sir was\nan ardent believer in this principle.\nI did not excel in my first ever match for my club, the Kamath Memorial Club, run by Achrekar Sir,\nwhich a host of my colony friends came to watch, I was out for a golden duck. I was the star batsman\nin the colony and it was natural that my friends would come to see me play. It was embarrassing to be\nbowled first ball and I had to make a series of excuses, saying the ball had kept low and the pitch\nwasn\u2019t good enough for batting. In the second match I got out for another duck and it was only in our\nthird game that I managed to score my first run, having survived seven deliveries. I was seriously\nrelieved to get off the mark. I used to keep a diary at the time that contained all the information from\nthese games, but unfortunately I don\u2019t have them any more.\nMy debut for the school wasn\u2019t quite as bad and I managed to score  runs in the match, which we\nwon comfortably. However, I will always remember the game for other reasons, because I learnt a\nvery important personal lesson. It taught me never to resort to unethical ways and to play the sport\nwith honesty and integrity at all times. The incident in question involved my first appearance in a\nnewspaper, which should have been a happy occurrence. The rule in Mumbai at the time was that a\nplayer\u2019s name only appeared in print if he had scored  runs. I had made , but there were a lot of\nextras in the team\u2019s innings and the scorer decided to credit six extras to me, increasing my score to\n. The scorer\u2019s logic was that it didn\u2019t matter because the overall score did not change. I had\nconsented to this without appreciating what I was getting into. The next morning, when my name duly\nappeared in a Mumbai paper, Achrekar Sir was seriously unhappy with what I had done and told me\noff for consenting to have runs added to my personal tally when I hadn\u2019t scored them. I acknowledged\nmy mistake and promised never to allow such a thing to happen again.\nThe first-match jinx continued in my first season for the Mumbai Under- team in Pune in . I\nwas only twelve then and travelled to Pune with just  rupees in my pocket. This was to be\nsupplemented with the little allowance we were given during the tour, which lasted more than a week.\nIn my only match for Mumbai I was run out. I was batting with someone from my school who was\nolder than me and because he was a faster runner he completed the runs quicker and pushed for a third\nrun that was not on. As a result I was run out and I returned to the pavilion with tears in my eyes.\nThoughtfully, two veteran Mumbai cricketers, Milind Rege and Vasu Paranjpe, consoled me, saying\nthe run just wasn\u2019t there and I shouldn\u2019t have been called to go for it.\nIt rained a lot in Pune in the next few days and as it turned out this was my only innings. As a result\nI was not picked for the West Zone Under- team and was upset because a few of my team-mates\nwho had not played a single ball had been chosen ahead of me. To add to my distress, I ran out of\nmoney because I spent it all on snacks and fast food \u2013 and arrived at Dadar station with no fare for the\nbus home. I had to walk back to Shivaji Park to my uncle\u2019s carrying two big bags and cried all the\nway. My aunt was very concerned when she saw me and asked what the matter was. I did not tell her\nthat I hadn\u2019t been selected for the West Zone team and all I said was I was not feeling too well.\n\nMy first earnings from cricket\nPlaying for my school regularly helped me learn the art of scoring big runs and batting for a long time.\nDuring school holidays I played practice matches for my club almost every day. In fact, in my first\nyear at Shardashram I played fifty-five practice matches during the summer break of sixty days. My\n\n\fsummer sessions used to start at . a.m. and I\u2019d bat for two hours, split into five net sessions. All of\nthese sessions were rigorous and required intense concentration. After the morning session, I would go\nstraight into the practice match, which would end at . p.m., then my evening session would start at\n p.m., after only a thirty-minute break. During the break Sir would often give me some money to go\nand have a vada pav (a popular Mumbai fast food) or a soft drink as a treat.\nBetween  p.m. and  p.m. I\u2019d have five more net sessions, before a final session of fifteen minutes,\nwhen Sir would place a one-rupee coin on top of the stumps and if I managed to avoid getting out, the\ncoin was mine. In this session every bowler in the camp would come and have a go at me, with some\nsixty to seventy boys fielding. Even if the ball was caught  yards away, which was a distance bigger\nthan the boundary length at any school ground in India, I was out. It meant I had to hit every ball along\nthe ground to survive those intense fifteen minutes. It was a serious challenge but with time I started\nenjoying this session the most. Winning the one-rupee coin used to give me immense satisfaction and\ntaught me how to concentrate even when physically drained.\nAt the end of it all, Sir would tell me to run two full circuits of Shivaji Park with my pads and\ngloves on. That was the last part of my training and I\u2019d be completely exhausted by the end of it all. It\nwas a routine I would repeat right through during my summer holidays and it helped me to build up\nphysical and mental stamina.\nOccasionally my father came to take me home and I would always ask him to treat me to a special\nfruit cocktail at a juice centre near the club. While this regular demand was a little unreasonable,\nbecause at the time I did not realize that my parents also had to take care of the needs of my brothers\nand sister, my father would invariably end up giving me what I wanted, just to see me happy.\nOn other days, when I made my way home from Shivaji Park on my own, I\u2019d often fall asleep on the\nbus \u2013 if I managed to sit down, that is. Anyone who has been on a Mumbai bus at peak hours will\nknow just how difficult it is to get a seat. On days when I wasn\u2019t so lucky, it was still a challenge just\nto stand with the kitbag, because the bus conductors would inevitably complain about me taking up the\nspace of another passenger. It could be embarrassing because the conductors were often rude and\nwould sometimes ask me to buy two tickets. I didn\u2019t have the money for a second ticket and I had to\nlearn to take these remarks in my stride. Dirty clothes often added to the embarrassment. After I\u2019d\nplayed in them all day, the clothes were usually in quite a smelly state and this was the cause of a lot\nof discomfort and guilt on the way home. With time I evolved a way of wrapping the kitbag around\nme. Just as the helmet and pads became a part of me while batting, so the kitbag became an extension\nof me on the bus.\nSo when people ask me these days if I have ever been on public transport, I tell them I used to travel\non crowded buses and trains four times a day during my first year at Shardashram. And from a very\nyoung age I used to do it alone. I\u2019d often take the bus or train from Bandra to Churchgate, and it was\nall a great learning experience. Within a few months I had made a lot of friends and we had great fun\ntravelling together to matches.\n\nMoving to Shivaji Park\nAfter a year of commuting between Bandra and school, my family realized that the daily travel was\ngetting too much. I had to catch a connecting bus midway into the journey and if I missed the\nconnection I\u2019d be late for school. Also, the one-and-a-half-hour journey would end up exhausting me\nand it had started to have an impact on my training time. More worryingly, I had twice fallen sick in\nthe first year of my daily commute to Shardashram and had also contracted jaundice.\n\n\fIt was decided that I should move in with my uncle and aunt, Suresh and Mangala, because they\nlived at Indravadan Society, an apartment block close to Shivaji Park. In the end, I stayed with them\nfor four years and they were hugely supportive of my endeavours and had a formative role to play as I\ngrew up. In fact, there were times when I even made my aunt throw balls to me in our living room. I\nhad bought a couple of golf balls and transformed them into an oval shape with the help of a blade. I\nhad done this intentionally, so that when my aunt threw one to me, the ball would change direction\nafter pitching, either coming in or going away. The whole idea behind this was that, while killing time\nat home, I would learn to play with soft hands without damaging things in our living room.\nThroughout the drill, my aunt would sit on her chair, and after playing the ball I would collect it and\nhand it back to her. When my aunt wasn\u2019t around, I would hang up the ball in a sock and hit it with the\nedge of my bat. Hitting it with the bat\u2019s full face was much too easy and when I hit it with the edge I\nwould try to middle it as many times as possible. When it did not hit the middle, it would come back\nfrom different directions (it became an inswinger or an outswinger) and it was fun to negotiate the\nchallenge. These drills helped my hand\u2013eye coordination and also my awareness of which direction\nthe bat should come from to meet the ball.\nMy uncle and aunt\u2019s house was a thirty-minute walk from school. It meant I could get more rest in\nthe morning and could come home for lunch around  p.m. and go back to play a practice game at my\nclub by early afternoon. Sir would invariably schedule three practice games a week for me and would\nensure that I batted at number four in each one of them. He could do that because it was his club. I\nwould bat in my favourite position in all the matches I played and if I got out I\u2019d have to change\nquickly and go out and field. This was a good incentive to keep batting and not get out at all, as I\ndidn\u2019t enjoy fielding anything like as much as batting. After the match I\u2019d resume my own training in\nthe evening before calling it a day at ..\nOn days when there was a school match, we\u2019d try our best to stretch it to a second day. For example,\nif we were set to chase  we\u2019d score \u2013 runs on the first day and keep the remaining runs for\nthe next morning. This would allow us to miss school on the second day, and after quickly wrapping\nup the match in the first half an hour, the team would head off to the beach to play cricket. Playing\nbeach cricket was always a lot of fun and we would all have a great time.\nBoth my parents would visit me at my uncle and aunt\u2019s almost every day after they finished work.\nFor my mother in particular it was an arduous journey, since travelling there from her office in Santa\nCruz in peak-hour traffic on public transport was a real challenge back then. The fact that both of them\nwould happily put in the time after a full day\u2019s work, just so I would not feel neglected, was\nremarkable.\nIn the \u2013 season I started to make runs consistently and also scored my first hundred. We\nwere playing Don Bosco School at Shivaji Park and I was not out on  at the end of the first day. A\nfew days before this match I had invited Sir to my house for dinner. Sir, however, said he would come\nonly when I had scored my first hundred in school cricket. Feeling excited and anxious, I decided to\nsleep with my father that night and kept tossing and turning till late. My father tried to comfort me,\nsaying I should go to sleep and that my body needed rest after batting all day. I couldn\u2019t and only\nmanaged to get a couple of hours\u2019 sleep before waking up very early the next morning.\nSensing my anxiety, my father took me to a Ganapati temple in Bandra to seek the blessings of Lord\nGanesha and only then did I leave for Shivaji Park. On my way I visited another Ganapati temple, the\none I regularly visited before games. There was a water tap inside the temple premises and I regularly\nused to drink from it before I went to the ground. I did the same that day and in the very first over hit\ntwo boundaries to reach my hundred. True to his word, Sir came for dinner that night and it was a\n\n\fdeeply satisfying moment.\nOne of my best early seasons was at Shardashram in \u2013, when I played in both the Giles Shield\nand the Harris Shield. For those unfamiliar with the intricacies of Mumbai cricket, the Giles Shield is\nmeant for boys under the age of fourteen and Harris Shield for those under sixteen. Looking back, it\nseems remarkable that I played in both, but I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time. These tournaments\nare acknowledged as breeding grounds for young talent in Mumbai and good performances tend to get\nnoticed in the city\u2019s cricket circles.\nIn the Harris Shield that season I scored a record , runs in five matches and was out only once.\nIt now seems extraordinary, but my scores in the quarter-final, semi-final and final read  not out,\n not out and  not out. What\u2019s more, after scoring  not out in the semi-final of the Harris\nShield, I walked right across the Azad maidan (recreation ground) to the other side to play in a Giles\nShield match, in which I made  not out, winning us the game.\nI started out with a hundred in the first match of the season, scoring  before getting out, and it\nwas a dismissal I have never forgotten. I was out stumped to an off-spinner who was hearing-impaired\nand I vividly remember the expression on his face when I was beaten by a beautifully flighted\ndelivery. But the ball went on to elude the keeper and within a fraction of a second the bowler\u2019s\nexpression turned from euphoria to despair as he saw the missed stumping opportunity. Yet I did not\ngo back to the crease and instead started walking back to the pavilion, allowing the wicketkeeper to\ncomplete the stumping. It was the only time I was out in that season\u2019s competition. While I didn\u2019t\nconsciously mean to show sympathy to the bowler, it was one of those moments that are difficult to\nexplain. It was not an act of charity exactly. Rather, it was a good ball and I knew I had been\ncomprehensively beaten. The keeper fumbled the take and the bowler looked distraught at the missed\nopportunity. He had done everything for the wicket and deserved the dismissal.\nIn the semi-final of the Harris Shield against St Xavier\u2019s in February , a three-day game, we were\n\u2013 when I went in to bat at number four, with Vinod Kambli, an extremely talented youngster in\nMumbai\u2019s cricket circles at the time, already at the crease, having gone in at number three. We\nimmediately plundered the St Xavier\u2019s attack and never let up all the way through what would become\na record-breaking partnership. With the Azad maidan being an open ground and a very big one, the\nopposition had to run long distances to retrieve the ball after a hard-hit boundary and we found\nourselves singing songs and enjoying ourselves in the middle of the pitch. It was our way of switching\noff while batting together for long periods. At the end of the day we were both not out, with Vinod on\n and me on , and, needless to say, Shardashram were in a commanding position in the game.\nThe following morning, we both made our double centuries and then just kept on batting \u2013 despite\nAchrekar Sir wanting us to declare the innings. At one point he sent our assistant coach to the\nboundary to instruct us to declare. We could hear him scream our names and shout instructions, but\nwe pretended not to hear and tried not to look in his direction. He kept at it for ten minutes before he\nrealized that it was a futile attempt and returned to the dressing room. We just wanted to carry on\nbatting and enjoy ourselves in the middle.\nAt lunch we had reached \u2013, of which I had contributed . As soon as we left the field I was\ninformed by the assistant coach that I was in serious trouble. When I asked why, he told me that\nAchrekar Sir had wanted us to declare in the morning and I had disobeyed him by carrying on. Sir was\nof the opinion that we had more than enough runs to declare, and if we weren\u2019t able to bowl the\nopposition out for less we did not deserve to be in the final. I decided to declare right away to save\n\n\fmyself from Sir\u2019s ire that evening. Vinod asked me not to, however, because he was not out on .\nHe pleaded with me to give him one more ball so that he\u2019d reach . I said that it wasn\u2019t my call and\nwe needed Sir\u2019s permission to continue. So I rang Sir from a public phone next to the ground and the\nfirst question he asked was how many wickets we had managed to take before lunch. That was Sir\u2019s\nstyle. He was well aware that we hadn\u2019t declared and hadn\u2019t taken any wickets, but he wouldn\u2019t say so.\nI informed him that we had batted till lunch and that I was about to declare. With Vinod pleading\nbeside me, I quickly mentioned to Sir that Vinod wanted to speak to him and handed over the phone.\nBut Vinod was scared of Sir and ended up not saying a word about batting on for another over.\nI duly declared the innings and, despite having batted for a day and a half, went on to open the\nbowling with the new ball and bowled a lot of overs in the innings. I did not feel the least bit tired; all\nthe hard work in the summer camps had started to pay off. I started out bowling medium pace, then\nchanged to off-spin when the ball was semi-old and leg-spin when the ball had lost all of its shine.\nVinod too bowled very well and picked up six wickets as we dismissed St Xavier\u2019s for  to make\nthe final.\nThat partnership of  was the highest in any form of cricket in the world at the time. Coming in\nthe semi-final of the Harris Shield made it all the more significant in the local cricket community. It\ngained us both a lot of recognition. We had become quite a pair and what made batting with Vinod fun\nwas that I never knew what he\u2019d get up to next. In one match in the same season he actually started\nflying a kite while we were batting together. Suddenly I couldn\u2019t see Vinod, because he had walked \nmetres away from the pitch and was holding the string of a kite \u2013 right in the middle of the innings! It\nwas his way of enjoying himself and I knew he\u2019d get a severe reprimand from Sir for doing so.\nSir wasn\u2019t to be seen on that day, however, and Vinod was confident of getting away with it. I\nwasn\u2019t so sure. I had a feeling that Sir was watching us from somewhere and would surely pick up the\nissue at the end of the day\u2019s play, as was his style. Sir was known to hide behind a tree on occasions to\nwatch us play, and in fact it rarely happened that he\u2019d miss a game of ours. At the end of the day he\nwould then give us a \u2018demonstration\u2019 session, so called because Sir would demonstrate what we had\ndone wrong in terms of footwork, stance or stroke selection. Sure enough, at the demonstration session\nat the end of that day, I was given a chit to read aloud and the first item was \u2018Vinod kite\u2019. Sir, upset at\nwhat Vinod had done, asked him what he thought he was doing flying a kite while batting and warned\nhim never to do so again. He promised, but with Vinod nothing could be taken for granted.\nHaving defeated St Xavier\u2019s comprehensively, we were runaway favourites in the final against\nAnjuman-I-Islam, which was to be played at the Cricket Club of India, which is India\u2019s equivalent of\nthe MCC, established in . It was my first competitive game at CCI and a number of Mumbai\ncricket luminaries were present to see us bat in the final. They had heard about the world-record\npartnership and wanted to see if we were good enough to have a career in cricket. Dilip Vengsarkar,\nSunil Gavaskar and CCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur were in attendance and I did not want to\ndisappoint them.\nOn the eve of the final I was given a superb gift by Hemant Kenkre, Sunil Gavaskar\u2019s nephew,\nwhich served as an added incentive to perform well. At the time I did not have good pads to play with\nand Sir had a word with Hemant about it. Hemant had with him a set of pads used by Sunil Gavaskar,\nthe really light ones with blue padding inside, and decided to give them to me. I was delighted and\nhumbled and went with Ajit to his house to collect my gift.\nI felt very proud to wear pads once used by Sunil Gavaskar. I went in to bat thirty minutes before\nlunch on the first day of the final and kept batting for close to two days. I was eventually unbeaten on\n when we were bowled out before tea on the third day. It was a very significant innings in the\n\n\fcontext of my career, for shortly afterwards I was included in the list of Probables for the Mumbai\nRanji Trophy team.\nIn my early days as a cricketer another person who helped me considerably was Hemant\nWaingankar. Hemant, a student of my father\u2019s, knew me as a child and has followed my career from\nstart to finish. It was at Hemant\u2019s initiative that Anil Joshi, Vijay Shirke and Sanju Khamkar of\nSungrace Mafatlal, a well-known Indian company, came forward to support both Vinod and me with\ncricket equipment. I am glad that our friendship, which is now close to three decades old, continues\neven today.\n\nMy Sir\nLooking back at these years of cricket, I must say I owe a lot to my coach Ramakant Achrekar \u2013 as\nwell as his assistants, Das Shivalkar and Laxman Chavan. Had it not been for Sir, I would not be the\ncricketer I turned out to be. He was a strict disciplinarian and did everything he could for me.\nOn certain days he would even drive me all the way across Mumbai on his scooter to get me to\nmatches on time. Even though I loved cricket, there were still occasional days when playing with my\nfriends at home was such fun that I would conveniently forget I was supposed to go to the nets. If I\ndidn\u2019t turn up, Achrekar Sir would jump on his scooter and come to find me at Sahitya Sahawas.\nInevitably, I would be outside, engrossed in some game or other with my chums. Sir would spot me in\nthe melee and virtually drag me to our apartment. I would come up with excuses but he would have\nnone of it. He would get me to change and put on my shoes and then I\u2019d ride pillion with him as we\nheaded off to Shivaji Park. On the drive he would tell me, \u2018Don\u2019t waste your time playing inane games\nwith these kids. Cricket is waiting for you at the nets. Practise hard and see what magic can transpire.\u2019\nAt the time, I hated being dragged off but as I look back I feel sheepish about my actions and can only\nadmire Achrekar Sir\u2019s farsightedness.\nSir also punished me on one occasion when trying to teach me a very important lesson.\nShardashram English and Shardashram Marathi schools had made it to the finals of the Harris Shield\nand the match was to be played at the Wankhede Stadium. I was at that stage a Giles Shield player and\nhad nothing to do with the Harris Shield. Knowing that I\u2019d want to go and watch the game, Sir had\narranged a practice match for me and warned me not to miss my own match and go off to the\nWankhede. However, I disobeyed and went along to the final, not anticipating that Sir would be there.\nHe was as angry as I\u2019d ever seen him and he said it wasn\u2019t for me to come and watch other people\nplay, for if I practised hard enough, one day people from across the world would come and watch me\nplay.\nAchrekar Sir has undoubtedly made a significant contribution to cricket in Mumbai and India. I am\nby no means the only pupil of his to go on to represent India; others include Lalchand Rajput, Vinod\nKambli, Pravin Amre, Ajit Agarkar, Sanjay Bangar, Balwinder Sandhu, Chandrakant Pandit, Paras\nMhambrey, Sameer Dighe and Ramesh Powar. Not for one moment has he been interested in financial\ngain, however. Quite the opposite, in fact \u2013 there were many occasions when he would help out those\nwho were so poor they could not even afford the few rupees normally charged for his summer school.\nThroughout my career, before each tour and each series for India, I would make four visits that were\nvery important to me: to two temples in Mumbai, the Ganesh temple in Shivaji Park and the\nSiddhivinayak temple in Prabhadevi; to my aunt and uncle; and to Achrekar Sir.\n\nMy short career as a fast bowler\n\n\fMy first good season for Shardashram earned me a trial place at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai\nin  under the legendary Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who was head coach there. The\nMRF Pace Foundation had been set up with the explicit aim of grooming local fast-bowling talent,\nsomething that we have always lacked in India. Coaches from across India had been asked to name\ntalented youngsters and my name was suggested by Vasu Paranjpe, veteran Mumbai cricketer and one\nof India\u2019s best coaches. Vasu Sir has always been extremely supportive of my efforts and has been a\nkind of mentor to me. Though the camp was primarily meant to identify talented fast bowlers, Ajit\nadvised me to take my full kit to Chennai. The thought was that if I wasn\u2019t selected as a bowler I could\nbenefit from batting in the nets there. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given my build and height, I didn\u2019t\nstand out as a potential international pace bowler and Dennis Lillee jokingly advised me to focus on\nmy batting instead. As it turned out, I was always a batsman who wanted to learn the art of fast\nbowling.\n\nThe first break\nAll the hard work under the watchful supervision of Sir finally paid off when I was picked in the squad\nto represent Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy on  November . The Ranji Trophy, the premier\ndomestic competition in India, was started in \u2013 and named after the famous KS Ranjitsinhji,\nIndian cricket\u2019s first global figure, who played for England against Australia in . It is an\nimportant platform and consistent performances in the Ranji Trophy can earn a player a national callup. In the s it was played on a zonal basis. First-class teams from each zone, West, North, South,\nEast and Central, played each other before the top teams advanced to the knock-out stage.\nDespite making the Mumbai squad, I did not make it to the final XI in any of the matches. This\nmeant I narrowly missed out on playing alongside Sunil Gavaskar, who retired from all forms of\ncricket after the  Cricket World Cup, a few months before I made the Ranji squad. When I was\ngrowing up, Mr Gavaskar\u2019s thirty-four centuries for India had always served as a huge inspiration. It\nwas the ultimate benchmark for a batsman, and not to have played alongside him remains a regret.\nHowever, that season I did get a little taste of the Ranji Trophy, as a substitute fielder \u2013 and also of\ninternational cricket, while fielding at the Brabourne Stadium for a Pakistan team against India!\nIt was a festival match and two Pakistan cricketers, Javed Miandad and leg-spinner Abdul Qadir,\nhad gone off the field at lunchtime. I was asked to substitute and was deployed at wide long on by\nskipper Imran Khan. Within minutes Kapil Dev hit a skier and, despite running in  metres, I wasn\u2019t\nable to reach the ball. I remember complaining to my friend Marcus Couto that evening on the train\nhome that I could have taken the catch if I had been positioned at mid on instead of long on. I don\u2019t\nknow whether Imran Khan remembers the occasion or has any idea that I once fielded for his Pakistan\nteam.\nOne incident I remember from my Ranji Trophy debut season took place when we played in Baroda\nin one of the West Zone encounters. I was just fourteen then and was sharing a room with Suru Nayak,\na former India international. The team had reached Baroda a few days in advance and on one of the\ndays we had dinner a little earlier than normal. Afterwards Suru Nayak asked me to go to bed,\nsuggesting that I should take some rest while the other players went out to offer pujas at the local\ntemple. I had no reason to disbelieve him and went off to sleep in my room. Only later did I find out\nthat the other players had gone out partying at night and because I was only fourteen I had been\nconveniently left out.\nI wasn\u2019t always so well behaved, of course. In  I remember playing for the Mumbai Under-\n\n\fteam at Cuttack in Eastern India. We were staying in a college dormitory and there were fifteen beds\naligned in a row. Next to the dorm was a balcony and beyond it lay the college sports field. Two of my\nfriends in the team were Jatin Paranjpe (who went on to play one-day international cricket for India)\nand Vinod Kambli, and together we had planned that after lights-out we would sneak around and\ngather up all the other players\u2019 shoes, including their spikes. With the dorm pitch-dark, we started\nthrowing them at Kedar Godbole, one of our hapless team-mates. Other players were also in our line\nof fire and before they could figure out what was going on they were hit by a barrage of shoe missiles.\nWhen they started throwing them back at us, we ducked and their shoes flew over our heads and over\nthe balcony into the adjoining field. Finally, at two in the morning, the whole team was down on the\nground looking for their shoes and chappals!\n\nRanji Trophy debut\nThe following year, I was watched closely by Mumbai captain Dilip Vengsarkar in the Cricket Club of\nIndia nets when the Indian team came to play a match against the touring New Zealand team.\nVengsarkar was impressed with the way I played against Kapil Dev and sometime later, on \nDecember , when I was fifteen, he told the selectors that I was ready to play for Mumbai against\nGujarat, giving me my first big break. Vengsarkar himself was busy with national duty and I filled in\nfor him. In my debut match I scored  not out and in the process became the youngest Indian to\nscore a century on his first-class debut. I finished the \u2013 season as Mumbai\u2019s highest run-scorer\nand made half-centuries in six of the seven matches I played. Mumbai lost a hard-fought semi-final\nagainst Delhi and I ended my debut season with a respectable batting average of .. In the semifinal, Madan Lal, former India fast bowler and coach, was playing for Delhi and I remember playing a\nstraight drive to him that was much talked about that evening. It was a shot that got me noticed,\nadding to my stock at the time. Everything about the shot was perfect \u2013 balance, head position, timing\n\u2013 and the ball raced to the boundary.\nMy performances for Mumbai got me selected for the season-opening Irani Trophy match at the\nbeginning of November . The Irani Trophy, between the Ranji Trophy champions and the Rest of\nIndia, is a key component of the Indian domestic cricket calendar and is a major opportunity to get\nnoticed. Playing for the Rest of India, I scored a hundred against Ranji champions Delhi in my first\nIrani Trophy game and it was during this match that the Indian touring team for the much-awaited tour\nto Pakistan in November\u2013December  was announced.\nBefore I knew it, at sixteen years of age, I had been picked to play for India.",
    "1989-1993": " MY FIRST TOUR\n\nI had always dreamed of playing cricket for India. Getting an opportunity to fulfil my dream at such\nan early age was indeed very special. What made it even more significant was that we were playing\nPakistan in Pakistan and their bowling attack included fast bowlers of the quality of Imran Khan,\nWasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Aaqib Javed, not to mention the leg-spinners Mushtaq Ahmed and\nAbdul Qadir \u2013 quite a test for any debutant.\nIt was baptism by fire. So much so that after my very first innings in Test cricket, during which I\nwas all at sea against Wasim and Waqar, I began to doubt my ability to bat and questioned whether I\nwas ever going to be good enough to play at international level.\nBefore describing my debut series, I want to go back to that first Irani Trophy game for the Rest of\nIndia against Delhi. I had scored  in the first innings before I was bowled by Maninder Singh,\nIndia\u2019s ace left-arm spinner at the time. The disappointment did not last long, however, because it was\nthat evening when I learned I had been named in the Indian squad for the Pakistan tour. Ecstatic at my\ninclusion, I was determined to make a mark in the second innings.\nThe occasion was particularly special because my brother had come to see me play. In fact, since I\nwas a minor and could not sign the tour contract, Ajit had to sign it on my behalf. Vasu Paranjpe had\nalso mentioned to my father that morning that I would surely get a hundred and said that he should\ncome and watch me bat. My father did just that and, to his satisfaction, what Vasu Sir had predicted\ncame true. However, the century would not have happened but for the contribution of Gursharan\nSingh, the Punjab batsman who later played a Test match for India against New Zealand in .\nGursharan had fractured his finger while batting against the bowling of Atul Wassan, a Delhi fast\nbowler who also made his debut for India against New Zealand in . He was sitting in the dressing\nroom injured and there seemed to be no way he could play a further part in the match. I was batting\nwell and was unbeaten on  when our ninth wicket fell. Knowing that Gursharan couldn\u2019t bat, I\nstarted walking back to the dressing room, assuming it was the end of our innings. Just then I saw\nGursharan walking towards me, ready to bat one-handed.\nIt was later revealed to me that Raj Singh Dungarpur, then chairman of the national selection\ncommittee, had asked if he would go out and help me get to my hundred. In an exemplary show of\ncourage, Gursharan had agreed. In fact, when we met at the wicket I felt distinctly embarrassed seeing\nhim there in such severe pain. I told him that it would be perfectly understandable if we called off the\ninnings. Showing tremendous grit, he told me, \u2018Ab to tera hundred kar ke hi jayenge.\u2019 (I will get back\nto the pavilion only after you get your hundred.) He doggedly stuck to his task, and I\u2019m glad to say\nthat his bravery was respected by the opposition bowlers, who did not resort to bowling bouncers.\nIt was a favour I would never forget. It was a show of remarkable resilience by Gursharan and I\ntried to repay the debt by doing what I could at the time of his benefit match in Delhi in April . I\nhad promised him that as long as he gave me a few days\u2019 notice, I\u2019d turn up to play, no matter where I\n\n\fwas. I am glad I was able to keep my promise.\n\nIndia in Pakistan, November\u2013December \nEncouraged at having got a hundred against India\u2019s domestic champions, I headed to Pakistan soon\nafter feeling reasonably confident. Maybe because I was still a teenager, I didn\u2019t feel any extra\npressure about playing against Pakistan. The whole political baggage of India\u2013Pakistan cricket meant\nnothing to me. I was simply treating it as my first tour, which was challenge enough. In any case, no\none really expected me to be a part of the playing XI at such a young age, certainly not in any of the\nTests. Some thought I might get a chance in one of the one-day games, depending on the team\u2019s\nperformance in the series, while others believed I was there only to get a feel of international cricket.\nTo be honest, all the talk passed me by. I just wanted to do well for India and score a lot of runs.\nOther than that, everything else seemed unimportant. That was natural enough, because everything had\nhappened rather quickly in my life. Just five years after I took to playing competitive cricket, I had\nbecome a part of the Indian squad \u2013 it was a pretty quick move from school to international cricket.\nOn arrival in Pakistan I didn\u2019t sense any tension and went out for regular meals in the evening with\nsome of the other cricketers. Their friendly approach helped put me at ease and it was not until we\nreached Lahore that a curfew was imposed on going out in the evenings. On my travels around India I\nhad always bought gifts such as sarees for my mother and aunt and shirts for my father and uncle, and\nso in the first few days in Pakistan I did the same. This time I bought them some local shoes and\nslippers.\nThere was tension within the squad, however, as a result of a dispute that had blown up before the\ntour between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the players over the issue of\nplayers\u2019 involvement in a few unsanctioned matches in the United States on the way back from the\nWest Indies tour in . The matter had gone right up to the Indian Supreme Court and was\neventually settled when the court lifted a ban imposed on the players by the BCCI. The other\ncontroversy that arose on the eve of the tour was over the issue of match fees. It had escalated into a\nserious dispute, with the players opting to give up their match fees altogether as a mark of protest.\nFortunately for the junior players in the team, skipper Krishnamachari Srikkanth instructed us to stay\naway from the problems and concentrate on the job at hand, which was to evolve a strategy to tackle\nImran, Wasim, Waqar and Abdul Qadir.\nI had a good start to the tour and in one of the two games before the first Test, against the Pakistan\nBoard Patron\u2019s XI in Rawalpindi, scored  before getting out to Iqbal Qasim, a left-arm spinner who\nplayed for Pakistan in fifty Tests. It was a decent innings and I received a standing ovation from the\ncrowd. I began to feel I had a slim chance of getting into the Test team and dared to dream of my first\nTest cap. I finally heard the news of my inclusion in the playing XI from skipper Srikkanth on the\nnight before the first Test in Karachi.\nIt is very difficult to describe the feeling. I was part of a band of eleven fortunate men who had been\ngiven the duty of representing close to a billion Indians. It was an honour every aspiring cricketer\nlives for, to play for his country against the best of world cricket. And with the honour came\nresponsibility. I was going to be accountable to the cricket fans back home and was expected to give\nmy best for them. In fact, I could imagine nothing more significant than doing something worthy for\nthe national team and the passionate Indian cricket fans.\nI was sharing a room with Salil Ankola, the fast bowler who has now gone on to become an actor.\nSalil was bowling well at the time and was also making his Test debut. Neither of us could sleep the\n\n\fnight before the match. We were both about to start a new chapter and were aware that it was an\nopportunity that could change our lives for ever.\n\nFirst Test, Karachi, \u2013 November \nPakistan won the toss and opted to bat first on a greenish wicket so I didn\u2019t have long to wait to walk\nonto the field for the first time as an India player. My life had taken a giant leap and it is a moment I\nwill always remember. It also happened to be Kapil Dev\u2019s th Test match and we were all excited\nfor him. Only Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar had achieved the distinction before.\nMy first day of international cricket wasn\u2019t without drama and one incident in particular left an\nunpleasant feeling. In the post-lunch session a bearded man clad in salwar kameez entered the field\nand went straight up to Kapil Dev, abusing him for being in Pakistan. Kapil, who was preparing to\nbowl at the time, later recounted to us that he asked the fellow to leave him alone and allow him to\ncontinue with the game. After his exchange with Kapil, the intruder then went over to mid off, where\nManoj Prabhakar, our top fast bowler on the tour, was fielding. He abused Prabhakar before moving\non to skipper Srikkanth \u2013 and with Srikkanth he got physical. In those days, with the sport far less\ncommercialized, players could choose what kit to wear. Most of our team preferred T-shirts, but\nSrikkanth liked to wear a buttoned shirt and this was torn open in the scuffle.\nI was fielding at point and I was scared I would be next and was ready to run to the safe confines of\nthe dressing room if the intruder came towards me. Up to this point, no security personnel had done\nanything to stop the intruder from disrupting things in the middle. It was only when the Indian captain\nwas being manhandled that security finally came onto the ground to drag the spectator off. It was a\nserious security lapse, yet the organizers seemed hardly perturbed. The truth is that it was much more\nthan a cricket match that was being played between the two teams. The political history of partition\nhas always cast a pall over India\u2013Pakistan cricket and it was my first taste of this unfortunate reality.\nThe next day we were even more astonished to find the Pakistan press suggesting that the intruder had\nactually been trying to congratulate Kapil Dev on playing his th Test match. The issue of\nSrikkanth\u2019s torn shirt didn\u2019t merit a mention by the local media.\n\nAll at sea\nOn the second day of the match, Pakistan were all out for , with skipper Imran Khan scoring \nnot out. Finally, it was our turn to bat. The pitch was lively and we didn\u2019t get off to a good start. We\nwere soon reduced to \u2013, with Srikkanth, Navjot Sidhu, Sanjay Manjrekar and Manoj Prabhakar out\ncheaply. Wasim and Waqar were bowling really fast and it was a trying time for every Indian\nbatsman. I hadn\u2019t quite anticipated what awaited me out in the middle when I went out to bat at\nnumber six. There\u2019s no harm in admitting that I was all at sea against Wasim and Waqar in my first\ninnings in Test cricket. I was trying to be aggressive to almost every ball, as that was how I had\nalways played the game. I was trying to get on top of the bowlers, but more often than not I was\ncomprehensively beaten. The pace was far greater than I had ever faced and the skill on display was of\nthe very highest standard. The guile of both bowlers left me thoroughly confused.\nAn account of one Wasim over will give an idea of my plight in the middle. I was on strike to him\nfor the third ball of the over, which turned out to be a vicious bouncer. Having studied Wasim\u2019s\nbowling, I was convinced the next ball would be a yorker and was mentally prepared for it. It turned\nout to be another bouncer, which I left. While I kept expecting a fiery yorker, balls five and six also\n\n\fturned out to be bouncers, and at the end of the over I said to myself, \u2018Welcome to Test cricket.\u2019 Not\nwithout reason is it acknowledged as the most challenging format of the game.\nMy stay at the crease was short and not sweet. I had lasted only twenty-four balls, at least half of\nwhich I had missed. I had hit two boundaries but not for a moment had I felt comfortable. It was only\na matter of time before I was dismissed. I was finally bowled for a rather lucky  by another\ndebutant, Waqar Younis, and on my way back to the pavilion my mind was riddled with self-doubt.\nIt was a very important moment in my career. I had come to the international stage after blazing my\nway through domestic cricket. I had managed to score a hundred on debut in the Ranji and Irani\ntrophies, but here I was on the international stage unable to put bat on ball. I was struggling, plain and\nsimple. The difference in standard between domestic and international cricket was colossal.\nI batted only once in that first Test match, which ended in a draw, and in the following days I\napproached our coach, Chandu Borde, and a number of senior team-mates to discuss what I needed to\ndo to improve. I had a long chat with Ravi Shastri, already an established star at the time, who advised\nme to be patient for the first fifteen or twenty minutes, which were bound to be uncomfortable. Ravi\nwas of the opinion that once I had played out the initial burst from the Pakistani bowlers, things would\nturn easier. The key was to spend time in the middle. But would I be given another opportunity to do\nso? I could easily have missed out on the second Test, not only because of my low score in the first\nbut also because of the way I had batted.\nIt came as a huge relief to see my name in the playing XI for the second Test at Faisalabad.\n\nSecond Test, Faisalabad, \u2013 November \nI knew it was a chance I could not afford to squander; it would be a big test of my ability and\ntemperament. What made the task considerably more difficult was that Pakistan won the toss on a\ngreen-top and put India in to bat. The stage was set. All through my career I have relished these\nmoments of adversity. It is no good just performing on a docile track against weak opposition. A\ncricketer gets true satisfaction only if he is able to perform in difficult conditions against the best\nbowlers.\nOnce again we lost early wickets and I went in to bat with four top-order wickets down for . This\ntime around, although it really wasn\u2019t my style then, I forced myself to stay at the wicket for the first\nfifteen minutes to get used to the conditions. I have no qualms about confessing that it was difficult.\nThe bowlers were definitely on top at the start of my innings, but with time things turned easier. I was\nable to adjust to the pace and bounce of the wicket, and my confidence was gradually coming back.\nI managed to play  balls en route to my first half-century in Test cricket and was finally\ndismissed by Imran for . I was involved in a -run partnership with Sanjay Manjrekar and though\nI hit only four boundaries, the innings gave me a lot of satisfaction. It also taught me a good lesson:\nthere was no point in trying to blaze my way through every innings. Most importantly, this knock\nconvinced me that I could actually cope with international cricket, though I knew I still had a lot to\nlearn. In the second innings I ran myself out for eight, sacrificing my wicket for Mohammad\nAzharuddin, who was nearing a well-deserved hundred. In the end, we managed to thwart a Pakistan\nvictory. After two Tests the series was still drawn and it was evident that Pakistan were feeling the\npressure. Many had predicted a \u2013 scoreline in their favour and it was starting to play on their minds.\n\nThird Test, Lahore, \u2013 December \n\n\fFrom Faisalabad we moved to Lahore for the third Test. Unable to venture out of the hotel in the\nevenings, the players and the touring Indian media were feeling a little restless and this called for\nsome original thinking. For the first and only time in my career the media and the players got together\nfor what was decreed a \u2018Sunday Club\u2019. It was to be an evening of stories, music, food and fun and\neveryone had to wear something fancy. It turned out to be a very successful experiment, but sadly it\nhasn\u2019t been repeated since. It definitely helped to create a bond between the team and the media, so\nnecessary during an arduous away tour.\nI wore a blue pullover to the Sunday Club and that\u2019s where the often published picture of me with a\nthick moustache, Aussie fast bowler Merv Hughes-style, was taken. The food served that evening was\nunbelievable. Lahore is a foodie\u2019s delight and I wolfed down all the delectable kebabs on offer and I\nloved the haleem (a stew of meat and lentils). In fact, I had a voracious appetite throughout the tour.\nMy body was still growing and I ate huge amounts. On non-match days I used to eat keema parathas\n(mincemeat parathas) and lassi (yogurt drink) for breakfast and by the time I went back to India I had\nput on a few kilos and had also grown much stronger.\nThe Lahore Test was local hero Javed Miandad\u2019s th and in a change from the first two Test\nmatches in Karachi and Faisalabad, we were faced with the flattest of batting decks, which had\nobviously been prepared to help Javed score a hundred, which he duly did. Even after five days, the\nfirst innings of both teams had still not been completed.\nAt the start of my innings in Lahore I misjudged the bounce of a straight delivery from Imran,\nwhich hit me on my biceps. I was furious at allowing myself to be hit on a flat pitch. The point of\nimpact instantly turned numb and my first instinct was to step out and dispatch the very next ball over\nthe boundary. However, the lesson learnt at Faisalabad came to my rescue and I reined myself in.\nI had worked my way to  off ninety balls when I tried to play an on drive to Abdul Qadir and was\nbowled. I had been batting well and I regret not going on to play a long innings. It was an opportunity\nmissed. It has to be said, though, that the match, a tame draw, was not the best advertisement for Test\ncricket.\n\nSweet dreams\nThe fourth and final Test of the series was at Sialkot and we knew that we\u2019d be given a green-top,\nwhich offered Pakistan\u2019s best chance to take the series. By now they were desperate to win; a draw\nwould have been considered a series defeat for Imran and his team. When we arrived at Sialkot, I was\ninvited to the MB Malik bat-manufacturing company. Sialkot has quite a tradition of bat-making in\nPakistan and at the time I didn\u2019t have a contract for my bats and could pick up any bat and play. I went\nto the factory with a few of the other players and chose two or three bats for myself.\nI was so excited about my new bats that I even dreamed about them one night. Apparently, it was\naround midnight and I walked straight out of my room asking for my bats. Maninder Singh and Raman\nLamba saw me advancing down the corridor and said to me, \u2018Tere bats to tere pass hi hai. \u2019 (Your bats\nare with you only.) When I didn\u2019t respond, they realized that I was sleepwalking. They helped me back\ninto the room and put me back to bed. By that stage of the tour, Raman and I had struck up a good\nfriendship and spent many hours together discussing the nuances of batting. He was fun to be with and\nit was absolutely tragic that he died after being struck on his head by a ball while fielding during a\nfirst-class match in Dhaka in .\n\nFourth Test, Sialkot, \u2013 December \n\n\fWhat made the Sialkot Test special was that my brother Ajit had travelled to see me play. It was an\nadded incentive to do well and both Ajit and I still remember the kindness the locals bestowed on him\nthe moment they became aware that he was from India and had come to watch cricket.\nAs expected, the wicket was green, but the December weather was also heavy, resulting in a lot of\nearly-morning fog. So much so that play never started on time and it ended early each afternoon. This\nmeant the four Pakistani fast bowlers could come at us all day, hoping to roll us over and secure the\nupper hand. In the first innings I played pretty well for my  and was feeling good before falling lbw\nto Wasim. I wasn\u2019t so uncomfortable at the start of my innings and the initial apprehension was no\nlonger an issue. I hit some pleasing shots and scored at a good clip in the course of my -ball stay at\nthe wicket.\nIndia managed a -run first-innings lead, with Vivek Razdan, a fast bowler who played two Tests\nfor India, picking up \u2013 in the Pakistan first innings. We had bowled them out for  and\nunderstandably Pakistan came back at us hard at the start of our second innings. We lost a cluster of\nearly wickets and I went in to bat at \u2013, with a day and a half still to go in the match.\nWaqar was bowling from one end and it was absolutely essential to survive the initial burst. I had\njust scored my first run when Waqar bowled a short delivery, which I expected would rise chin-high. I\nmisjudged the bounce of the ball. It rose six inches higher than expected and hit me on the flap of my\nhelmet before deflecting and hitting my nose. At the time I was the only batsman besides Srikkanth\nnot to wear a grille. It wasn\u2019t an act of bravado; I just wasn\u2019t used to playing with one. Ajit, who was\nsitting right in front of the Indian dressing room, later said to me that he had clearly heard the sound\nof the ball hitting my helmet and deflecting on to my nose.\nMy vision was blurred and my head felt heavy. After impact, the ball went towards the slips and my\nnatural movement was to see where the ball had gone. It was then that I noticed all the blood spattered\non my shirt. As I was trying to recover from the blow, I was amused by Javed Miandad\u2019s comments.\nIn an attempt to psych me out, he was saying things like \u2018Arre tujhe to abhi hospital jana parega; tera\nnaak tut gaya hai.\u2019 (You may have to go to the hospital; your nose is broken.) To add to my\ndiscomfort, a banner in the stands read, \u2018Bachhe ghar ja ke dudh pie kea aa.\u2019 (Kid go home and drink\nmilk.)\nI ignored all this while our team doctor, Vishwas Raut, inspected the injury. He put some ice on my\nnose and asked if I wanted to go off. I did not, for I considered it a moment of reckoning. Going off\nwould suggest I was scared. And truly I wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t the first time I had been hit, though the\nimpact was much more severe than anything I had suffered before. I decided to carry on and said,\n\u2018Main khelega.\u2019 (I will play.) It was important for my own self-esteem, and by staying in I felt I had\nmade a statement to the opposition.\nSeeing me continue, Imran asked Javed to move away and all the Pakistani players went back to\ntheir respective field positions. Soon after the resumption, I got a full ball from Waqar on my legs and\nflicked it to the boundary. I followed it up with a drive on the off side and felt genuinely good about\nmyself. I had treated the balls on merit and wasn\u2019t just being aggressive to avenge being hit. Soon it\nwas time for tea and I had an opportunity to regroup. After the break I started to bat really well. I was\nfeeling confident and was determined not to give my wicket away. Importantly for the team, I\nmanaged to play out the day and we were on course to force a draw.\nShortly after going back to the hotel, however, I felt heavy in the head. We had a team function in\nthe evening but I asked permission from manager Chandu Borde and went to bed early after taking a\nfew painkillers and having dinner with Ajit and Navjot Sidhu, which helped me calm down. When I\ngot up the next morning after a good night\u2019s sleep, I was feeling ready for the challenge of the final\n\n\fday. We were on \u2013 overnight and needed to spend at least two more hours at the crease to deny\nPakistan any opportunity of winning the Test.\nNavjot Sidhu and I held out until I was dismissed by Imran for . It was my second half-century in\nTest cricket. Denying Pakistan a win on home turf was a big achievement for India, especially with the\nkind of bowling attack they had, and it served as a major confidence boost for the team. We were all\nelated at the performance.\n\nThe Abdul Qadir over\nAfter the Tests, we played a five-match one-day series in which none of the matches was played for\nthe scheduled fifty overs. While some of them were affected by rain, the third match was abandoned\nbecause of crowd trouble after Pakistan had been reduced to \u2013 by some good swing bowling from\nManoj Prabhakar. The first match was due to be played in Peshawar on  December  and had to\nbe called off at the last moment because of rain. However, a large crowd had braved the inclement\nweather and it was finally agreed between both teams that a twenty-over-a-side exhibition game,\nperhaps the first ever Twenty game, would be played for the sake of the crowd. It was a good call,\nas the fans deserved to be given their money\u2019s worth. They are the ones who make the game what it is,\nafter all, and they are pivotal to its health around the world.\nMost people will agree that even an exhibition game between India and Pakistan can\u2019t help being a\nserious cricket match. At Peshawar Pakistan had scored  in their innings, and when I went in to bat\nwith three wickets down, the asking rate had climbed to well past  runs an over. Srikkanth was\nbatting with me and suggested we should dig in and get some practice for the following games. I was\ndetermined to go for the bowling and felt we still had a chance to make a match of it if we played our\nshots. That\u2019s what I suggested to Srikkanth and while he was a tad surprised, he told me to play the\nway I was comfortable with.\nMushtaq Ahmed, an up-and-coming Pakistani leg-spinner at that stage, was bowling and I hit him\nfor a couple of sixes and a boundary in the first over I faced. While both sixes were hit over long on,\nthe second went a fair distance and hit the dressing-room window, breaking the glass. The Pakistanis\nhadn\u2019t expected me to hit it so far and Abdul Qadir, an experienced old hand at the time, walked up to\nme and said, \u2018Bachhe ko kyun mar rahe ho; dum hai to mujhe mar ke dikhao.\u2019 (No point in hitting\nsixes off a newcomer; if you have the skills, try and hit me.) I said to him that he was a great bowler\nand that I was sure he wouldn\u2019t allow me to hit him.\nWith just two overs left we needed more than  runs and Qadir was to bowl the penultimate over.\nOur only chance was to attack. I had made up my mind that if the ball was in my zone I\u2019d go for my\nshots. As it happened, most of the balls were in my hitting arc and I took  off the over. I hit the first\nball for six over long on and followed it up with a four off the third ball. The fourth ball resulted in a\nsecond six, which I hit straight over the bowler\u2019s head. Seeing me hit straight, Qadir bowled the fifth\nball wide outside off stump in an attempt to get me stumped. I had anticipated the move and hit the\nball over long off for the third six of the over. For the last ball he went even further outside off stump\nand I stretched out to hit the ball wide over long off, to make it four sixes in the over.\nThe crowd, which had been confident of a Pakistan victory till an over earlier, was roused by this\nunexpected turn of events and started making a lot of noise. There was a sudden increase in energy\nlevels at the ground. The match was now being played in full seriousness and no one really knew\nwhich team would win. We needed  runs off the last over, bowled by Wasim Akram. Eventually we\nfell short by three runs. Straight after the match, Abdul Qadir walked up to me in true sportsmanlike\n\n\fmanner and said \u2018Bahut ala batting.\u2019 (Very well batted.)\nThat innings of  off eighteen balls at Peshawar had a defining impact on my career. In the eyes of\nthe public, it had overshadowed my effort at Sialkot, which was far more difficult and far more\nsignificant as far as I was concerned. The Sialkot innings had allowed us to save the Test match and\nalso the series. But for people at home the innings at Peshawar was the real talking point. It had given\nme instant recognition and made me a household name. For the first time I was asked for autographs,\nwhich was a strange feeling. Before we went to Pakistan I had been able to go out with my friends and\nhave bhel (a type of fast food loved all over Mumbai) and do all those normal things. Afterwards,\nwhen I went out with my friends, people would come up and ask if I was Sachin Tendulkar. And it was\nall down to that one innings at Peshawar. While it would have been premature to suggest I had\nestablished myself at international level, it had certainly given me a toehold.\nWhen I got home, I could tell that my parents were proud of my achievements, but there has never\nbeen any over-the-top celebration in my house. While I knew that my father was extremely happy and\nsatisfied, he wouldn\u2019t ever show off his emotions in an extravagant manner. When I did well, my\nmother would always light a diya (a kind of candle) and offer sweets to God, but that\u2019s as far as it\nwent. Sometimes people are kind enough to compliment me on my off-the-field behaviour more than\nmy on-field performance. They say that I seem to have managed to keep my feet grounded. If that\u2019s\ntrue, then I have no hesitation in saying that all the credit goes to my family.\nAjit\u2019s presence in Pakistan was a great help and we talked every evening about my game and how I\ncould improve. While there were many senior team-mates who I could go to, I was most comfortable\ndiscussing things with Ajit, as he knew my game better than anyone. He had watched me grow up as a\ncricketer and it was natural that his observations would always be pertinent.\nAfter coming back from Pakistan, I felt much more positive about myself as a cricketer and was\nlooking forward to India\u2019s next away tour, to New Zealand at the start of . I was pretty confident\nof getting picked but was still delighted to see myself in the squad when the touring side was\nannounced.\nIndia in Pakistan \nst Test.

It\u2019s often windy and chilly\nand that, coupled with the short boundaries in most of the grounds, makes it very different from\nconditions back home in India. In  the challenge was doubly difficult, with Richard Hadlee, one\nof the finest ever exponents of swing bowling, close to his best. As a seventeen-year-old on his first\ntour away from the subcontinent, I was excited about the opportunity.\n\nIndia in New Zealand, February\u2013March \nThe first few days in New Zealand were not easy. The accent of the locals there was very strange to\nour ears and the food took some getting used to. The accent problem resulted in an incident involving\nManoj Prabhakar very early in the tour. Prabhakar needed an adapter to charge his gadgets and for\nsome reason decided to put on what he thought was a New Zealand accent while speaking to the\nhousekeeping staff in the hotel. When asking for the adapter on the intercom he was almost chewing\nup the first \u2018a\u2019, as a result of which the word was sounding like \u2018dapter\u2019 and the staff were having\ndifficulty understanding what he was asking for. Prabhakar got angry after a point and said he needed\nthe \u2018dapter\u2019 immediately. In a few minutes there was a knock on his door and he opened it to find a\ndoctor standing there. The staff had heard \u2018doctor\u2019 for \u2018dapter\u2019 (partly because they pronounced\n\u2018doctor\u2019 as \u2018dactor\u2019) and had sent the resident physician to Prabhakar\u2019s room.\nThe first game of the tour was in New Plymouth and the ground was surrounded by hills. It was as if\na stadium had been planted in the middle of mountains and Bishan Singh Bedi, our manager, decided\nto make the most of the conditions. Bedi, one of the best left-arm spinners of all time, was a really\nhard taskmaster and liked to make us run huge distances to improve our fitness. At New Plymouth our\nfitness drills involved running in the mountains and by the end of the training sessions we had\nabsolutely no energy left.\nAs in Pakistan, I did not start particularly well and in the first Test at Christchurch, which started on\n February, I was dismissed by Danny Morrison for a golden duck. It was a good delivery but the\nsend-off was interesting, to say the least. I could hear most of the New Zealand players calling me a\nschoolboy, with plenty of F-words thrown in. They kindly advised me to go back to playing cricket\nwith my school chums, suggesting that I wasn\u2019t fit to compete at international level. I kept my mouth\nshut.\nThe second innings was an improvement in that I managed to stay at the wicket for close to an hour,\nplaying forty-four balls. My  runs were enough to give me confidence that I was capable of holding\nmy own in strange conditions. Although I had fallen to John Bracewell, trying to cut a ball close to my\nbody, I had successfully negotiated Richard Hadlee, which I counted as an achievement. Hadlee\u2019s first\ntwo deliveries to me were bouncers, but each was profoundly different from the other. The first was an\n\n\foutswinging bouncer that went away after pitching; the second came in from the same spot and I had\nto keep my eye on the ball till the last moment to get my head out of the way. Such was the ability of\nthe man that you had to be at your best at all times to keep him at bay.\nNew Zealand won the first Test by ten wickets and the second Test match at Napier started only a\nfew days later, on  February. We decided to bat first after winning the toss but the first day was\ncompletely washed out by rain. The match finally started on the second day and I was unbeaten on \nby the end of the third day\u2019s play. The ball was doing a little and batting wasn\u2019t particularly easy, but\nnot once did I try to dominate the bowling the way I had in domestic cricket.\nWhen I went in to bat on the fourth morning the possibility of a hundred was on my mind. I was just\n runs short and was determined to take my opportunity. I started well and hit the very first Danny\nMorrison delivery for four. For the rest of the over he bowled short and I was content to leave\neverything. In his next over, I again hit a boundary off the first ball. The next was pitched up and I had\nalready made up my mind to go for a big drive but the drive was uppish and I was caught by the New\nZealand captain John Wright at mid off for .\nI was heartbroken. As I walked back to the pavilion I couldn\u2019t control my tears. Why on earth did I\nplay that shot when I was just twelve runs short? By the time I reached the boundary rope, tears were\nflowing down my cheeks. I\u2019m glad there weren\u2019t too many cameras then, as these days a cameraman\nwould definitely have picked up an embarrassing shot of me in tears. On reaching the dressing room, I\nwent straight to the bathroom and cried for a good few minutes. Missing out on what should have been\nmy first Test hundred was just too painful. It was only later that I was told I would have been the\nyoungest Test centurion ever. It was a missed opportunity and I remember telling John Wright, after\nhe took over as coach of India in , that he really shouldn\u2019t have taken that catch!\nWe eventually lost the three-Test match series \u2013 and then played the Rothmans Cup one-day triseries, with Australia as the third team. As in the first Test, I was out for a duck in the first ODI\nagainst New Zealand at Dunedin on  March, caught and bowled by Shane Thomson, who was bowling\nmedium pace. The only difference was that this time I had lasted one more ball. In the end, we lost the\ngame by  runs.\nI made a better fist of it in my next match, on  March , an important one in the context of the\ntournament. We had lost to Australia in the second game and now needed to beat New Zealand to stay\nin contention for the final. I made  runs off thirty-nine balls, in the process attacking their seam\nbowlers for the first time and hitting them for quite a few boundaries. We won the game by one run,\nwith Martin Snedden run out and Richard Hadlee bowled in the final over by Kapil Dev, who was\ndeclared Man of the Match for his all-round performance. For the first time my innings had been of\nuse to the team in an official ODI. I couldn\u2019t do much celebrating, though, because I damaged my\nright quadriceps during the game and had to be carried off the field. I couldn\u2019t walk at all by the\nevening and was on crutches for the next few days. It was the first serious injury of my career and my\ntournament was over.\nWhile we were in New Zealand, Asha Bhosle, one of the all-time great Indian singers, happened to\nbe performing in Wellington and the team decided to go to her concert. It was the first time I had seen\nher live and I just loved the experience. Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar, another of India\u2019s finest\nsingers, are still two of my favourites and to see them perform is always very special.\nOn my return to India, my father told me that I had to hone my God-given cricketing ability. He was\nright. It was time for more hard work to master the skills needed to face the fast swinging ball and I\nwas determined to put in the hours in the nets.\n\n\fIndia in England, July\u2013August \nAfter the New Zealand series, India travelled to England for what was our most important assignment\nof the year. India had won a Test series in England in  and we were all looking forward to\nrepeating the feat. We had a training camp in Bangalore just before the series and Bishan Bedi\ncontinued with his policy of making us run miles every day. We had to jog in a line at Cubbon Park,\nopposite the Chinnaswamy Stadium, and the last man in the line had to sprint to the front. The same\ndrill was followed for all the players and the exhausting routine finally resulted in Manoj Prabhakar\njokingly suggesting that he was so fast now he would reach the batsman before his delivery did.\nI had been to England twice before, in \u2013 and \u2013, as part of the Star Cricket Club, the\nteam of Kailash Gattani (a former fast bowler who played first-class cricket for Rajasthan in Indian\ndomestic cricket). In the first instance, I was sponsored by the Kolkata-based Young Cricketers\nOrganization, who contributed my airfare. Among other things, I remember the tour for the food we\nate. We stayed in school and college dormitories and had breakfast in their dining halls. For the first\ntime in my life I was served cold meat for breakfast. That meat could be eaten cold was a revelation to\nme!\nI was also amazed to see so many different types of cars. I have always had an interest in cars,\nthough we didn\u2019t own one at the time. Kailash Gattani had hired a luxury sedan and I was keen to find\nout as much as I could about the engineering details of these fascinating machines. Besides playing\ncricket, these were things that kept me occupied and I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity of exploring\na foreign country. Visiting Lord\u2019s, the mecca of world cricket, was a dream come true, and it all added\nto my ambition to play at such venues as a member of the Indian cricket team.\nIn , the tour started with a few first-class fixtures, which were followed by two one-day\ninternationals. While I was in good form at the start of the tour and scored runs in the first-class\ngames, I didn\u2019t do so well in the first ODI at Leeds on  July, making only . Happily, it didn\u2019t\nmatter because the team won \u2013 thanks to the batting of Manjrekar and Azharuddin \u2013 and we had a\nchance of victory in the series if we won the next game at Nottingham on the th.\nIn the second match England produced a better performance, batting first, with Robin Smith, the\nSouth African-born middle-order batsman, contributing  to their total of . We needed to bat\nreally well to close out the series. When I went in to bat at number six we needed a further  off\ntwenty overs. In those days, that was considered a stiff target. I scored a quick  off twenty-six balls\nand was dismissed with the score on , with  still needed to win, but we won the match and the\nseries \u2013, with Azhar seeing us home with an unbeaten . It was a perfect start to the tour, giving us\nsome welcome confidence going into the Test series.\n\nFirst Test, Lord\u2019s, \u2013 July \nThe first Test at Lord\u2019s will always be remembered for Graham Gooch\u2019s heroics with the bat. After\nbeing dropped on , he went on to make a triple hundred. He was eventually out for  and then\nproduced another century in the second innings. For India, the highlights were Azhar\u2019s hundred and\nKapil Dev hitting four successive sixes off Eddie Hemmings, the off-spinner, to save the follow-on.\nMy only significant contribution in the match was a catch off leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani\u2019s\nbowling to dismiss England\u2019s batting mainstay Allan Lamb in the second innings. It remains the most\nmemorable catch of my career. Hirwani had beaten Lamb in the flight as he stepped out to hit straight\ndown the ground. Despite failing to get to the pitch of the ball, Lamb went through with the shot and\n\n\fthe ball went high into the air, looking as if it was going to land some  yards behind the bowler.\nAs soon as Lamb hit the shot, I started sprinting from my position at long off. There was very little\nchance that I would make it, because I had been positioned a few yards wide of the conventional longoff position. It was only during the last few steps that I realized I had an outside chance. I had covered\na distance of more than  yards and was still short. I could dive forward, but I knew I would not have\nenough control to catch the ball. The other option was to carry on sprinting and try somehow to get a\nhand to the ball, which was dying on me. I chose the second option and to my surprise felt the ball\nland in my fully outstretched right hand at knee height.\nHaving completed the catch, I threw the ball up in the air in sheer ecstasy. My team-mates were\nnaturally delighted. Hirwani rushed to congratulate me and I felt thrilled at having pulled it off. The\ncrowd appreciated the athletic effort and I vividly remember the warm applause as I walked back to\nmy fielding position. The key to taking catches like these, it seems to me, is not to be afraid of taking\nthe initiative and deciding quickly, while always keeping an eye on the trajectory of the ball.\nWe lost the Lord\u2019s Test by the huge margin of  runs and needed to tighten our game before the\nsecond Test at Old Trafford a week later to remain alive in the series.\n\nSecond Test, Old Trafford, \u2013 August \nIn the first innings at Old Trafford, England once again put together a total of more than , with\ncenturies from Gooch and Mike Atherton, and we simply had to get as close to their score as possible\nin our reply. We were due to bat fourth in the match and any total in excess of  would be difficult\nto chase down on a wearing pitch. Azhar made another hundred and almost everyone in the top order\ncontributed to our first-innings effort. Had the lower middle order scored runs, we may have got closer\nto the English total and even managed a first-innings lead. It might also have given me an opportunity\nto go for my maiden hundred. But they got out in quick succession and I ran out of partners. I went in\nto bat at number six with the team score on  and was last man out for , trying to play a big shot\noff Eddie Hemmings. As Hirwani would I am sure agree, he was not the best number eleven in the\nworld. I felt I had to go for my shots sooner rather than later and I holed out to Chris Lewis at deep\nmidwicket as a result.\nHirwani was always fun to bat with and when he came in he said to me at the wicket that he would\nbe fine as long as the balls were pitched up. He said he had a problem facing bouncers and I assured\nhim that the English bowlers would not bowl bouncers at him because he wasn\u2019t a recognized\nbatsman. He managed to bat on for a while and gradually gained in confidence. So much so that he\nsuddenly charged out to Chris Lewis to give the ball a real whack. Chris\u2019s expression said it all. He\ndid not take kindly to a number-eleven batsman giving him the charge. He was fuming as he walked\nback to his bowling mark and a bouncer was now inevitable. However, in charging out Hirwani had\nsomehow broken his bat and it took a bit of time to get a replacement from the dressing room.\nLuckily, the few minutes that were lost in the bat change had a calming effect on Chris Lewis and\nHirwani survived his innings unscathed.\nWe were finally all out for , conceding an -run first-innings lead. It was evident that England\nwould want to score quickly and set us a target. Allan Lamb made a hundred in the England second\ninnings and on the final day they declared on \u2013, leaving us ninety-two overs to bat out. The\nEnglish attack, consisting of Angus Fraser, Chris Lewis, Devon Malcolm and Eddie Hemmings, had\nsome variety, and while the fast bowlers used the cloud cover to good effect, Hemmings extracted\nconsiderable purchase from the fifth-day track. With all the bowlers performing at their best, we were\n\n\fsoon reduced to \u2013. Then Azhar fell with the score on  and Kapil Dev was yorked by Eddie\nHemmings, leaving us at a perilous \u2013.\n\nMy first Test hundred\nWhen Manoj Prabhakar joined me in the middle we badly needed a partnership to save the game. I had\nbeen lucky at the start of my innings, with Eddie Hemmings dropping me when I had tried to play an\non drive. The ball had hit the outside part of my bat and spooned back to Hemmings, who failed to\nhold on to it. I learnt my lesson and decided not to play any more uppish strokes. At the same time I\nwas determined to play some shots and not go into my shell. Getting ultra-defensive would allow the\nEnglish bowlers to put more and more fielders round the bat, and by trying to score I would be able to\nkeep the field spread out. Every time I got a chance to score runs, I did so. Most of my scoring strokes\nwere in the nature of punches played with minimum risk. The balance between aggression and caution\nwas crucial and I was trying to focus on each and every ball. My fifty came up but it did not excite me.\nThe match was far from saved and that was the goal.\nAt the other end, Manoj Prabhakar was playing well and after a while it was clear we had succeeded\nin frustrating the English bowlers. The first task had been accomplished. When trying to save a match,\nthe important thing is to set small targets. These can be as little as batting the next five overs, or the\nnext hour, or even a session. If a wicket doesn\u2019t fall for close to a session, the opposition, however\nmuch they are in control, are bound to feel pressure. Time was gradually running out for England and\nrestlessness was creeping in.\nWhen I passed  runs, it was obvious that the thought of scoring a hundred would start to affect\nme. After all, it would be my first international century and the crowd had already started expecting it\nfrom me. I reminded myself of what had happened in New Zealand and was conscious not to repeat\nthe same mistake. There was still some time left in the day\u2019s play and England could press for victory\nif I got out.\nIn the mid-nineties I got a lucky reprieve against Angus Fraser. He bowled me a bouncer and I\nducked under it with my bat held above my head like a periscope. The ball hit the back of the bat and\nwent along the ground to fine leg. It could have gone straight into the hands of any of the close-in\nfielders or to the wicketkeeper. But it didn\u2019t. I was glad and thanked God for the reprieve.\nAt Old Trafford luck seemed to be with me. I batted patiently until I finally played a punch off\nAngus Fraser through mid off when on . Chris Lewis chased down the ball but by the time he threw\nit back to the bowler I had run three, completing my first Test hundred. The crowd stood to applaud\nbut I was extremely uncomfortable about acknowledging them. I had never been in that position\nbefore and was acutely embarrassed about raising my bat to the stadium.\nEvery time I look back at the footage of my first century, I realize that celebrating was not\nsomething that came naturally to me. It was only with time that I became more confident of my\npresence in the middle. \u2018Presence\u2019 is actually very important in international sport. It is one thing just\nbeing there in the middle, but it is another making people aware of your \u2018presence\u2019. It is about body\nlanguage and radiating confidence, something that the West Indian batting legend Viv Richards would\npersonify. With me it happened after I had scored a few hundreds and felt more established in\ninternational cricket. As I grew more assured of my presence, I came up with my own signature style\nof celebrating an achievement by showing the bat to the dressing room. Most cricketers develop their\nown style of celebrating. For example, the way Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne showed the ball to\nthe crowd after picking up five wickets in an innings was something they evolved over the course of\n\n\ftheir careers.\nAt Old Trafford I continued to bat on after reaching my hundred and with every passing over it was\nbecoming apparent that the match would end in a draw. When the match was finally called off with\ntwo of the twenty mandatory overs still to be bowled, we had reached  for no further losses.\nPrabhakar and I had put together an unbeaten -run stand.\nI remember walking back to the pavilion to a standing ovation. Both umpires, John Hampshire and\nJohn Holder, congratulated me on my hundred and all the England players walked up to me to offer\nsome kind words. In the dressing room my team-mates congratulated me \u2013 not just on my maiden Test\nhundred but also for batting through the day and saving the game for the team, meaning that it was all\nto play for in the third Test. It was the second occasion I had done so. This one was more satisfying,\nthough, because this time I played a central part in the effort, unlike in the fourth Test in Pakistan,\nwhere I had a supporting role.\nJust when I was about to relax after a good day\u2019s work, I was informed that I had to face the media.\nIt was going to be the first time I addressed a press conference. I asked our manager Madhav Mantri, a\nformer Test cricketer who toured England with India in the s, if it was compulsory or if I could\njust skip it. He assured me it was a routine matter and said that the journalists would only ask me\nquestions about my performance and about the match. My team-mates, however, started pulling my\nleg, saying they\u2019d ask me questions I couldn\u2019t answer and that it was going to be a really difficult\nsession. Looking back, I must admit that I quite enjoyed the experience. I was uncomfortable to start\nwith, but it was quite straightforward really. I just needed to share my thoughts and it wasn\u2019t such a\ndaunting task after all. Most of the questions were pleasant and it felt good to receive compliments\nfrom well-known cricket writers.\nI was declared Player of the Match \u2013 my first such award \u2013 and once again felt awkward at the\nceremony. I was handed the bottle of champagne but, not being eighteen, I didn\u2019t drink at the time. I\njust wanted the presentation to be over and to hurry back to the dressing room with the award as soon\nas possible. In the end I brought the bottle home with me to Mumbai and finally opened it on the\noccasion of my daughter Sara\u2019s first birthday in .\n\n\fOn returning to the hotel after the match I got a call from home and remember speaking to what must\nhave been thirty or forty people on the phone. It was a spontaneous gathering of all my friends at our\nneighbour\u2019s apartment to celebrate the hundred and it was really touching to know that people in the\ncolony were so thrilled at the accomplishment. Some of them jokingly mentioned to me that as I\nwasn\u2019t old enough to drink, they were enjoying a drink on my behalf. My parents were extremely\nhappy with my performance and my brother too felt vindicated.\nThe third Test match, at The Oval at the end of August, was another draw, which meant that we lost\nthe series \u2013, but I was still reasonably satisfied with my performances in England and felt I had\ntaken a few important strides. I returned to India a better Test cricketer and far more confident of\nmyself as a performer, ready for the next big challenges: a tour of Australia at the end of the following\nyear, followed by the World Cup jointly organized by Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIndia in Australia, November \u2013February \n\n\fWe began the tour with a couple of one-day practice matches in Perth in November , the first at\nLilac Hill and the second at the WACA, one of the fastest cricket wickets in the world. At the WACA\nwe were bowled out for just  and it was clear we had to adjust to Australian conditions as soon as\npossible if we were going to be competitive in the series.\nOur first three-day tour game was against a full-strength New South Wales team at Lismore\nbetween  and  November and it was in that game that I got my first taste of real Australian\ncompetitiveness. It was a fast, lively wicket and Geoff Lawson, the NSW captain, had no hesitation in\nputting us in after winning the toss. In addition to Lawson, their bowling attack included Mike\nWhitney, Steve and Mark Waugh, Greg Matthews and Wayne Holdsworth, and it was a tough test for\nus. The team also included Mark Taylor and five players \u2013 Whitney, Lawson, Steve Waugh, Mark\nTaylor and Matthews \u2013 had already played Test cricket for Australia.\nI was looking to be aggressive from the very beginning and played a number of horizontal-bat shots\nover point and gully. It was in this match that I had my first exchange with Steve Waugh, who didn\u2019t\nseem keen on the idea of an eighteen-year-old attacking the bowling like that. A lot of things were\nsaid to me and they were the first of many over the years.\nIt was in the course of this match that the Australian Test team for the first Test at Brisbane was\nannounced. Steve Waugh was not included in the side, so I said to him that if he wanted to fight with\nme, he first needed to get into the Australian team. It was all done in good spirit and throughout our\ncareers we had great mutual respect; in fact, the banter, it must be said, was a result of this. We knew\nhow important it was to get Steve Waugh out early and tried all we could to unsettle him. There were\noccasions when we even resorted to observing total silence when Waugh batted as we came to believe\nthat saying things to him actually strengthened his resolve to do better.\n\nA tough start\nIn the first Test at Brisbane, starting on  November , the Australians beat us convincingly,\nthanks in large part to superb bowling from Craig McDermott and Merv Hughes. Like most of our\nteam, I didn\u2019t do much with the bat and we knew we had to bounce back in Melbourne in the Boxing\nDay Test. At the MCG we remained competitive till the middle of the third day, with Kiran More\ncoming to the rescue with  in our first innings and Kapil Dev and Prabakhar both bowling well,\nbefore a batting collapse in our second innings dampened our hopes. I managed to stay in for a\nreasonable time and scored  off  balls, but I was disgusted with myself for trying to hit a big\nshot and getting out caught by Allan Border against the off-spinner Peter Taylor after doing all the\nhard work and playing myself in. I was so fed up that I didn\u2019t eat lunch in the dressing room and was\non edge for the whole day!\nSomething else happened in Melbourne that has never happened again in my life, I\u2019m pleased to\nsay. When I went back to the dressing room I realized that my abdominal protector had been broken\ninto three pieces when I was hit by a Bruce Reid delivery. Reid, the tall left-arm fast bowler, got a lot\nof wickets in the series and I was lucky that no major damage was caused by the accident!\n\nFighting back\nDown \u2013, we went to Sydney for the next Test on  January  knowing it was our last chance to\nget back in the series. It was a typical SCG wicket, helpful to the batsmen to start with, and I thought\nour bowlers did very well to bowl Australia out for  in the first innings. It was essential for us to\n\n\ftake a substantial lead and give our bowlers a chance to bowl Australia out again in the second\ninnings. I didn\u2019t sleep much the night before batting. I was sharing a room with Sourav Ganguly, who\nlater captained India and is a very good friend. I remember a startled Sourav waking up in the middle\nof the night and seeing me shadow-practise. Sourav wasn\u2019t playing in that game and was surprised to\nsee me up so late. I told him I was planning how to play McDermott and the other bowlers.\nUnsurprisingly, the next day I was feeling rather tired. India were batting and I was batting at\nnumber six, so I decided to take a nap on the dining table inside the SCG dressing room \u2013 asking\nSourav to wake up me up at the fall of the next wicket. He did so when Azhar got out. By then I was\nfeeling refreshed and was ready to go out and bat.\nFor the first time in the series our top order had fired and by the time I went in, the score was a\nhealthy \u2013, with Vengsarkar having contributed a half-century. We needed another good\npartnership to push on for a lead and, with the opener Ravi Shastri playing extremely well at the other\nend, that\u2019s what we managed to do. The second innings at Melbourne had definitely helped me and I\nwas now able to middle the ball from the very start. There was a phase halfway through when I began\nto lose concentration and feel edgy, but I forced myself to exercise restraint and it soon passed.\nAfter reaching my half-century, I began to play a lot more shots and was soon close to my second\nTest hundred. I vividly remember the glance to fine leg that brought up my century. I ran two and the\nsecond run was the fastest I have ever run. Ravi went on to score an excellent double hundred, the first\nby an Indian in Australia, as we put on  runs for the fifth wicket. Sydney continues to be my\nfavourite ground outside India and to score my first hundred in Australia at the SCG was special. I had\ngrown up watching cricket in Australia on the TV and used to wake up early to watch the Victoria Cup\nin . Now I was playing at the actual venues and scoring runs.\nThe SCG Test is also remembered for the debut of a plump Australian leg-spinner with a mop of\nblond hair. Though Shane Warne took only one wicket in the match, it was evident to us all that he\ncould give the ball a fair rip. While no one could have predicted the  Test wickets he would take in\nhis career, the fact that he had talent was obvious from the very first day he took to the field in\nJanuary .\nKnowing that we could bat only once \u2013 because of valuable time lost to rain and bad light on the\nthird and fourth days \u2013 we batted for close to an hour on the final day and declared with a lead of \nruns. With the track doing a fair bit and the bounce turning variable, we had a good chance of closing\nout the game in the time remaining. A win still seemed on the cards when Shastri\u2019s bowling helped\nreduce Australia to \u2013 and it was only some dogged rearguard action from Allan Border and Merv\nHughes that saved Australia.\nIn the one over I bowled I picked up the wicket of Hughes and it was a big moment for me because\nit was my first wicket in Test cricket. He was caught by Prabhakar in the slips for  after playing\nseventy-three balls, and if we had got his wicket a little earlier, we might have been able to close out\nthe game.\n\nLearning some lessons\nThe fourth Test of the series started at Adelaide on  January  and for the first time I was going\nto bat at the home ground of the legendary Sir Donald Bradman, the greatest batsman to have played\nthe game. While I did not do much at the Adelaide Oval, the team played some good cricket. We lost\nthe match by  runs in the end, but we remained competitive throughout and dominated the first two\ndays of the match. Kapil Dev had a good match with both bat and ball and in our second innings Azhar\n\n\fplayed a wonderful captain\u2019s innings, scoring . He and Prabhakar, who made , had brought us to\nthe brink of victory, but we were eventually all out for  chasing . With a bit of luck, the series\ncould have been \u2013 at Adelaide. Instead we went to Perth for the final Test \u2013 down.\nI scored my second hundred of the series in the fifth Test, which started on  February, and I count\nit as one of the very best I have scored. It was a quick wicket and for the first time since my debut I\nwas going in at number four in a Test. I relished the opportunity from the outset and hit sixteen\nboundaries in my . By that stage of the tour I had mastered a back-foot punch. While most batsmen\nfavoured the cut shot at Perth because of the extra bounce, I used the back-foot punch at every\nopportunity and because I was able to do so against good-length balls, it was making the bowlers\u2019 job\nthat much more difficult. It would usually bring me at least a couple of runs and when I timed the ball\nreally well it would even go all the way to the boundary.\nEarlier, the Australian media had talked up the fast, bouncy WACA wicket and how difficult it\nwould make it for us to cope with the Australian quick bowlers. But I never had a problem batting at\nthe WACA. This was because I managed to adjust to the bounce. Every time the ball got big on me, I\nstayed on the back foot and played the ball with soft hands at the last moment, standing up on my toes\nrather than playing a flat-footed defensive stroke.\nOne incident at the WACA brought home the intensity and competitiveness of the game in\nAustralia. I had just played a ball defensively and had no chance of a run. In what I thought was the\nspirit of the game, I was about to pick the ball up and throw it to Allan Border, the Australian captain,\nwho was fielding at gully. When AB spotted me bending down he screamed at me, saying, \u2018Don\u2019t you\ndare touch the ball.\u2019 After that I never tried to pick up the ball and throw it back to fielders. It was a\nlesson in how international cricket is played and I remembered it till the last day of my career.\n\nMeeting a hero\nIt was on this tour of Australia that I first saw a batsman who had been my hero when I was growing\nup \u2013 though it wasn\u2019t on the cricket field. I was in a hotel lobby in Adelaide with Sanjay Manjrekar\nwhen a cab pulled up outside. A guy wearing a cap got out and I immediately said, \u2018I\u2019ve seen him\nsomewhere before.\u2019 As he got closer I said, \u2018I don\u2019t believe it \u2013 that\u2019s Viv Richards!\u2019\nWhen he walked past us and headed up to his room, I turned to Sanjay and told him that I just had to\nmeet my hero. So we went to Reception and found out his room number and I made Sanjay call him \u2013\nSanjay had played a series against him in the West Indies in  \u2013 and before long we were on our\nway to his room. That was my first meeting with Viv. I spent only three minutes with him, just to say\nhello, but it was a very exciting moment for me.\n\n World Cup in Australia and New Zealand\nAfter the Test series we stayed in Australia, as the World Cup \u2013 my first \u2013 was just a few weeks away.\nThe idea was to help us acclimatize to the conditions, not that this was necessary after being in\nAustralia for close to three months. We had a few weeks to ourselves and with Vinod Kambli around\nthere was never a dull moment. Vinod and I shared a room and one thing that always stood out about\nhim was his dress sense. Vinod\u2019s clothes were as colourful as they could possibly get and on one\noccasion our manager Ranbir Singh Mahendra even said to him, \u2018Arre India ke liye khel rahe ho, aise\nclown jaise dress kyun pehente ho tum? Kuch dhang ka kapda pehna karo. \u2019 (You are playing for India.\nWhy do you dress like a clown? You should wear some decent clothes and dress sensibly.) Not that it\n\n\fhad any impact on Vinod, though!\nThose few weeks were relatively stress-free and we spent a lot of time relaxing in each other\u2019s\ncompany. On one occasion the leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani and I were having tea in our physio Dr\nAli Irani\u2019s room. Ali used to make special tea for us, with a particular kind of sugar. In the middle of\nour conversation Ali got a call from Ranbir Singh Mahendra, who was a vegetarian, asking if he could\nget him some garlic bread. After the call Ali turned all philosophical and said, \u2018There will come a\ntime when you guys will be there and will think about old Ali Irani who used to take care of us and\nmake us really nice tea.\u2019\nHirwani and I found it funny that he had turned unnaturally thoughtful and Hirwani asked him to\nrepeat what he had just said. Ali was reluctant to do so but when Hirwani insisted, he said it again. At\nthis Hirwani jokingly said to Ali with reference to his efforts to keep Ranbir Singh Mahendra in good\nhumour, \u2018Tu to har din  marta hai. India team mein tera naam pehle likha jata hai. Uske baad\nhamara naam aata hai.\u2019 (You score a double hundred every day by being in the good books of the\nmanager. Your name will come first in an Indian team and only then will our names be listed.)\nIn the World Cup, India failed to make the semi-finals, despite being competitive in most of the\nmatches. We lost to England and Australia by the narrow margin of nine runs and one run respectively\nand our second match against Sri Lanka at Mackay on  February was washed out because of rain.\nThe high point of the tournament for us was the match against eventual winners Pakistan on \nMarch  at Sydney. After two consecutive defeats, we were determined to turn things round\nagainst Pakistan. Batting first, we had to negotiate a hostile spell of fast bowling from Wasim Akram.\nAt one stage he was bowling magnificently to Vinod Kambli and, batting at the other end, I just kept\ntelling Vinod to nudge the ball and run. We put together an important partnership and I followed it up\nwith another with Kapil Dev, who scored a valuable  off just twenty-six balls. I was unbeaten on \nat the end of the innings.\nOur total of  wasn\u2019t a big score to defend, but we started well and Kapil Dev and Prabakhar\npicked up two early wickets for very little on the board. Our bowlers and fielders were charged up and\nthere was a lot of chat out in the middle. We were cheering each other on and giving the Pakistan\nbatsmen a hard time.\nThis match is often remembered for the tussle between our wicketkeeper Kiran More and Javed\nMiandad. Javed, if I remember right, was having back spasms and could not play his strokes freely. He\nwas finding it difficult to bat but was performing an uncharacteristic job for his team, trying to anchor\nthe innings and hold up one end. Behind the stumps, Kiran was constantly up and down, shouting out\ninstructions to our bowlers, saying Javed was in no position to play his shots. Infuriated at the\ncontinuous chatter, Javed imitated Kiran\u2019s actions by doing a frog jump. We were all stunned and\namused at the same time and this tiff between Kiran and Javed made the eventual victory even\nsweeter.\nI bowled my full quota of ten overs, conceding just  runs and picking up the vital wicket of\nopener Aamer Sohail. It was a satisfying win and by the end of the match I had completely lost my\nvoice because of all the shouting. It was the first time India had played Pakistan in the World Cup\nsince the inception of the tournament in  and it was the start of a string of victories against them\nin World Cups. The  victory was particularly pleasing because I was also Player of the Match.\nWhen we returned to India at the end of March after four and a half months in Australia I was a\ntransformed cricketer. The \u2013 Australia tour undoubtedly had a fundamental impact on my\ncareer.\n\n\fA brave man\nThe story of the Australia tour is incomplete without a story that has stayed with me over the years. It\ninvolves Venkatapathy Raju, our left-arm spinner, and Merv Hughes. They were great pals and on a\nflight to Perth, which is a little under four hours from Sydney, we dared Raju, one of the skinniest\ncricketers in the team, to go and grab Hughes\u2019s famous thick moustache. Merv, a huge man, was\nknown for his volatile temper and most of us were convinced that Raju would chicken out in the end.\nTo our surprise, he boldly went up to Merv and pulled his moustache, a feat of incredible bravery \u2013 or\nfoolishness. Merv took it all very sportingly and the act was applauded by everyone on the flight,\nmaking Raju an instant hero.\nIndia in New Zealand \nst Test.

It was the beginning of by far the best\npartnership of my life.\nI had just landed in Mumbai on our return from the  tour of England and was waiting to pick up\nmy bags when I first saw an extremely attractive woman looking down from the viewing gallery in the\nairport. Little did I know then that I had just seen my life partner. She was standing with a friend of\nhers, Dr Aparna Santhanam, now a well-known dermatologist in Mumbai. We had fleeting eye contact\nand then she disappeared.\nThe next I saw of the two of them was when I was making my way out of the airport. I spotted\nAnjali, dressed in an orange T-shirt and blue jeans, running out of the gate, apparently chasing after\nme. That was not all, because she soon started yelling, \u2018He is sooooo cute!\u2019 I felt awkward and started\nto blush, as I knew both Ajit and Nitin were waiting outside to take me home. My childhood friend\nSunil Harshe was with me and he murmured in my ear that a very good-looking girl was calling my\nname and seemed keen to meet up with me. I had of course seen her and found her particularly\nattractive, but I told him there was no way I could speak to her at the time, not with Ajit and Nitin\naround.\n\nThe years of courtship\nAnjali and I courted each other for five years between  and , a commitment that led to\nengagement and finally marriage. It has to be said that the two of us come from very different\nbackgrounds. Anjali is half Gujarati, half English and is a South Mumbai girl from a very well-to-do\nfamily. She went to St Xavier\u2019s College and then studied medicine at JJ Hospital. She was wellspoken and had an upbringing fundamentally different from my own. In her family, wearing Western\noutfits was the norm. My situation was completely different. I had hardly ever been out of my colony\nand had always mingled with cricket friends. I had never gone out with a girl, let alone brought one\nhome. Unlike most men of my age, who were able to meet girls at college, I had been playing for India\nfrom the age of sixteen and simply hadn\u2019t had the opportunity.\nWhile I first saw Anjali at Mumbai airport, it turns out that she had actually seen me a few weeks\nearlier on  August, when I got my first Test hundred at Old Trafford. At the time she was in England\nwith her parents, and her father, Anand Mehta, a former national bridge champion and a serious\ncricket fan, had called her to catch a glimpse of the innings on television. However, she had no interest\nin cricket and didn\u2019t watch at all. Soon afterwards she came back to India and it was when she went to\nthe airport to receive her mother, Annabel, who is English but has worked in India tirelessly as a\nsocial worker for more than three decades, that we ran into each other for the first time.\n\n\fThe day after she saw me at the airport \u2013 and this is her version, by the way \u2013 she asked a friend of\nhers, Mufi Muffazal Lakdawala (who played club cricket and is now a very well-known surgeon), if he\ncould get her my phone number. After coming home from the airport, she apparently jokingly\ndeclared to her parents that she had seen the man she wanted to marry.\nMufi did get her my number but it was pure chance that I happened to pick up her call. There were\nno mobile phones then and I was hardly ever at home to pick up the land line. The stars, I can say in\nhindsight, were aligned. She said she was the girl from the airport and asked if we could meet. While\nnot trying to sound too eager, I told her that I remembered her and could meet with her at the Cricket\nClub of India, where I was playing. At first she did not believe me and asked if I could remember what\nshe was wearing on the day I had first seen her. When I mentioned the orange T-shirt and blue jeans,\nshe was impressed.\nShe came along to the CCI, as we\u2019d arranged, but we couldn\u2019t really meet up and talk properly with\nso many people around. Being discreet was the best thing under the circumstances. All we did was\nexchange numbers and after that we started talking on the phone fairly regularly. It wasn\u2019t long before\nmy sister-in-law Meena began to suspect that something was cooking between the two of us. She often\nasked me about this girl who kept on calling me but I tried to avoid answering. I wasn\u2019t used to\ndiscussing private things with my family and felt distinctly uncomfortable.\nOur first proper meeting finally happened at my house when we came up with the idea that Anjali\nshould come over posing as a reporter wanting an interview. That was her first and last foray into\njournalism. A female reporter had never come to my home for an interview before and, in light of all\nthe phone calls, my sister-in-law was particularly suspicious about who this special reporter was.\nFor that first visit, I was keen to offer Anjali something to eat and was disappointed to see that\nhardly any of the chocolates I had brought back from England remained. In fact, there were only two\nleft and in my keenness to salvage the situation I carefully cut them up and set a plate of chocolate\npieces in front of her. She couldn\u2019t stay for long, however, and our first meeting was much too brief\nfor my liking.\nDespite being brief, it left a lasting impression. I simply felt happy in her presence. I can\u2019t really\npinpoint what I liked about her but what I can say is that I was able to relax and be myself with her\nfrom the very first day. I had intentionally spoken very little because I was worried about\nembarrassing myself by saying something stupid. She did most of the talking and that was fine with\nme. In any case, at the time I wasn\u2019t as fluent with my English, which was the language of\nconversation. It was perhaps a defensive act, but Anjali never made me feel self-conscious. She was\njust the most ideal soulmate I could have asked for.\nWhile we continued to speak for long periods on the phone after our first meeting, we hardly ever\ngot a chance to meet. On some occasions we did plan to meet at around . p.m. and go for a drive.\nHowever, it turned out that Anjali\u2019s parents, who were unaware of the relationship then, were\nwatching television and so, despite wanting to meet, Anjali was unable to leave the house without\narousing suspicion. For my part, I drove all the way from Bandra to Warden Road, a journey of about\nforty minutes, and waited in the car until I was finally forced to turn back. Because of the risk of\npeople recognizing me, I couldn\u2019t even call her from the public phone close to her house (there were\nno mobiles then) and had to go all the way back to Bandra to find out what had gone wrong, then I\u2019d\nask her to try again and drive all the way back. Needless to say, I am now an ardent advocate of\nmobile technology!\nThe second time we met was when Anjali suggested I pick her up from her house and we go for a\ndrive in her Maruti , India\u2019s most affordable small car in the early s. She wanted to have\n\n\fcoconut water along Marine Drive and it was the only time in our lives that we have sat on the bench\nopposite the Air India building in Mumbai drinking coconut water. In my eagerness to please her, I\nhad agreed, despite knowing that there was a possibility of people spotting me and coming up to speak\nto me. The century in England had made me a household name and people had started to ask for\nautographs. I did not mention this to her in case she thought I was pompous. Because Anjali knew\nnothing about cricket, it had never occurred to her that people might recognize me. She simply wasn\u2019t\naware of how public a cricketer\u2019s life in India can be. It is true that there is hardly any privacy, which\nmeans that we\u2019ve never been able to do the things couples normally do \u2013 watch a film, stop at roadside\neateries in the evening, take a walk along the beach and the like. It was an adjustment Anjali and I had\nto make very early on in our lives together. The one time we tried to defy the odds was when a few of\nus \u2013 Anjali, her father Anand and some of our friends \u2013 went to see the film Roja in Worli in South\nMumbai in . We planned the outing meticulously and I put on a wig, a false moustache and\nglasses in an attempt to hide my identity. Things went smoothly till the interval, when I dropped my\nglasses and broke one of the lenses. My friends asked me not to put the broken spectacles back on just\nin case something went into my eye, but in my panic the moustache came off too and soon people\nrecognized me, causing us all a lot of embarrassment. There was such pandemonium that we had to\nflee from the cinema halfway through the film.\nWe had a similar experience in Switzerland just a few years ago, when we were holidaying as a\nfamily. I had suggested we stay in a chalet rather than in a hotel and do our own cooking. Things were\ngoing to plan till the day we decided to visit Interlaken, now famous for Indian tourists as the location\nof the hit Bollywood musical Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. We had planned to leave early in the\nmorning and walk to the site. A few of our friends had advised us not to do so in case people\nrecognized me on the way, so instead we hired a horse and carriage. Just as we were setting out, a few\nof the other Indian tourists spotted me. Within minutes they started following us and even when I told\nthe carriage driver to go faster, they kept running behind us, trying to catch up. It was only when they\nrealized that they couldn\u2019t keep pace that they finally gave up.\nSuch intrusion meant that Anjali and I could hardly meet in public and after our second meeting we\nweren\u2019t in touch at all for a period of six months. I was away on tours, while Anjali was busy\npreparing for her medical finals. I knew how hard she had worked and was sure she\u2019d do well in the\nexam. On the day of the exam I rang her from Australia very early in the morning to wish her luck. I\nmust say I was delighted to hear her voice after so long. She was panicking and was worried that she\u2019d\nfail the exam. Knowing that was impossible, I said to her that if she failed the examination, so would\neveryone else in Mumbai. She had always come top and there was no way it would be different this\ntime round. I also said that the number of hours she studied in a day equalled the total number of\nhours I used to study in a whole month! It was only much later that she told me that my call made a\nbig difference to her. She felt I must have really cared to have called from Australia after six months.\nIt was far more than care, as far as I was concerned.\nAs expected, she topped the examination and wanted to go ahead with pursuing an MD in\npaediatrics. I was extremely proud of her achievement and encouraged her to do so, which resulted in\nher getting posted to a hospital at Palghar, on the outskirts of Mumbai, as an intern. Luckily for us\nboth, her friend Mufi was also posted in the same hospital. Palghar was such a small town that Anjali\nhad to take a train to Boisar, some twenty minutes away, to find a phone to call me, and Mufi was her\npartner during these trips.\nIt was while studying for the MD that she began to take more of an interest in cricket. We had\nstarted talking about the game on the phone and she even bought a book of rules. Often she\u2019d come up\n\n\fwith questions like: where\u2019s cow corner, or is the wicketkeeper right- or left-handed? But she picked\nup the game quickly and I would ask her questions from time to time to keep her interest going. The\nfirst tournament she watched on television was the  World Cup and she was heartbroken to see\nme get out cheaply against the West Indies after I had edged a ball from Curtly Ambrose. So much so\nthat Mufi had to console her, saying the ball was so good that others wouldn\u2019t have come near it and it\nwas because of my exceptional batting prowess that I had managed to somehow get an edge. If only\nthat were the truth!\nIn the absence of mobile phones and text messages at the time, Anjali and I wrote a series of letters\nto each other. Because I was not stationed in a particular city for more than a few days when on tour,\nAnjali would have to work out where I would be in two or three weeks\u2019 time and post the letters\naccordingly. These letters remain prized possessions and when I look at them again one thing that\nstands out is Anjali\u2019s handwriting. Compared to mine, hers was wonderful to look at. I also have to\nconfess that writing did not come naturally to me. I would often take a very long time thinking\nthrough each word that I would write for my beloved.\nAfter coming back from the World Cup in March , I visited Anjali in her family\u2019s house for the\nfirst time. Once again Mufi played a crucial role. Anjali\u2019s parents were told that it was our first\nmeeting and that Mufi had orchestrated the visit. It was carefully stage-managed and was quite a\nperformance. In fact, it was only after we decided to get engaged that we told her parents the real\nstory. I must say I was extremely thankful to Mufi for all the help.\nWe weren\u2019t comfortable with the fact that the relationship was still a secret and decided it was time\nwe let our families know that we were serious about each other. So I asked my childhood friend Sunil\nHarshe to arrange for Ajit and Anjali to meet, and the three of them got together at the Willingdon\nClub in South Mumbai. Waiting at home, I was anxious the whole time the meeting was on. It wasn\u2019t\nthat I was looking for approval as such from Ajit, but it meant a lot to me to see my friends and family\nlike Anjali as much as I did. I remember waiting for what seemed like an age, but when I finally saw\nSunil and Ajit coming back, Sunil, who was walking one step behind Ajit, gave me a quick thumbs up\nto indicate the meeting had gone well. I was delighted to know that Ajit too thought Anjali was the\nright person for me.\nAll this time Anjali\u2019s interest in cricket was growing and by the time I went to New Zealand in \nshe had a grasp of the nuances of the game. It was the series in which I started opening the batting for\nIndia in one-day cricket. I was delighted with my new role and was happy to be able to share my\nsentiments with Anjali when I spoke to her from New Zealand.\nBy the end of the New Zealand tour we had been seeing each other for four years and it was time to\nmove on to the next stage of the relationship. It was during one of our numerous phone conversations\nfrom New Zealand that Anjali broached the subject of engagement and I immediately took her up on\nthe suggestion. I told her that I was ready to get engaged whenever she was but it would be better if\nshe could speak to both of our parents on my behalf \u2013 talking was never my strong point. She was\nhesitant at first but it was a great relief to me when she reluctantly agreed to take on the responsibility,\nas I would not have felt comfortable discussing the engagement with my father. Not that my father\nwould not have agreed \u2013 I was absolutely certain he would \u2013 it was just that I felt slightly embarrassed\nat the thought of discussing my future wife with him.\nAnjali later told me that she too had initially felt self-conscious informing my parents that their son\nwanted to get engaged to her. But my parents knew me well enough to realize why she had ended up\nbeing the one to speak to them about it and all they wanted to know was if we both felt the same way\nabout the engagement. They were in fact delighted with the decision. The same thing happened a year\n\n\flater, when it was Anjali who spoke to both families about our wedding plans. She has far better social\nskills than I do and I was once again relieved to see her take on the rather difficult task. I have no\nhesitation in acknowledging that she did a commendable job!\n\nEngagement and marriage\nWe got engaged on  April , which also happened to be my twenty-first birthday. The\nengagement party was a low-key affair with family and close friends and was held at Anjali\u2019s family\u2019s\nhouse at Warden Road, Breach Candy, in South Mumbai. It was an occasion of great significance in\nour lives and we will always remember the joy we felt. Our families were delighted at the union and it\nmarked a whole new beginning for me. We finally tied the knot on  May . Anjali Mehta had\nbecome Anjali Tendulkar and I entered a new phase in my life.\nEven before we got engaged, Anjali had mentioned to me that she wanted me to pursue my dream\nand was willing to give up her career for the family. This was a huge sacrifice. We were aware that it\nwas impossible for us both to continue with our respective careers and that one of us needed to be at\nhome to take charge of the house and family. To my relief, Anjali took over the home front, allowing\nme to continue with my cricket, and I will always appreciate the sacrifice she made very early in our\nlives.\nThe wedding was a traditional affair and, as in most conventional Maharashtrian households, my\nmother gave Anjali the mangalsutra (a necklace worn by the wife to ensure her husband\u2019s good\nhealth), sindoor (vermilion, the red powder worn as an auspicious mark by Indian married women),\ngreen bangles, anklets and a toe ring, which are all considered part of the wedding ritual. In fact, I\nremember her asking me if I wanted her to wear all or any of the things that my mother had given her.\nAll I said was I wanted her to wear the mangalsutra, and to this day she has never taken it off.\nThese adjustments, both in her professional and personal life, could not have been easy but she has\nnever shown any resentment. This has not only added to my respect for Anjali but also meant I had\nactually found someone who I could love and depend on. I must confess it is not always in my nature\nto say what I feel, but there is no doubt how much I owe her. Funnily enough, I have never called her\nby her name. I haven\u2019t ever said \u2018Anjali\u2019 or \u2018Anja\u2019 or any such thing while calling her. In all these\nyears I have not been able to figure out how I should refer to her. Frankly, it doesn\u2019t really matter, for\nthat is how I am and, despite all my shortcomings, my wife has been with me every step of the way.\nAt the beginning, marriage did have one unfortunate side-effect, however. Marital bliss led me to\nrelax my routine and the outcome was weight gain. I enjoyed myself thoroughly during our\nhoneymoon and indulged my palate to a nicety. We had a few of our friends with us in Goa, where I\nwas also playing a double-wicket tournament, and that added to the fun. Almost every day during the\nhoneymoon I feasted on deliciously decadent desserts and other delicacies I normally kept away from\nduring the playing season. There were plenty of chocolates and ice creams and such indulgence came\nat a price.\nWhen I returned to Mumbai I realized that I couldn\u2019t get into any of my clothes. I had put on a few\ninches around the waist and it was time for some strict control on the culinary front. We weren\u2019t\nplaying a great deal of cricket in  and that was another reason why I had let down my guard. So\nfor twenty straight days after returning to Mumbai, I put myself on a diet of nothing but tea without\nsugar, boiled chana (chickpeas), oranges and sweet lime. I also started doing some rigorous exercise\nagain to get back into shape. I used to run for an hour in the morning, followed by weight training, and\nplayed two hours of table-tennis every evening. And during the table-tennis sessions I\u2019d go and fetch\n\n\fthe ball from wherever it went. Even if I had played a smash and the ball had gone behind my\nopponent, I\u2019d perform the chore myself, to get more exercise. The result was a weight loss of  kg in\ntwenty days. But I had started to feel dizzy and weak and my trousers were now too loose, so I decided\nit was time to stop. The first meal I had after three weeks on the diet was boiled spinach and broccoli\nand after that I went back to eating normally.\n\nThe perfect partner\nTo come from such a different background and yet be able to integrate herself into the more\ntraditional Tendulkar household speaks volumes for Anjali\u2019s character and commitment. Frankly, no\ncredit can be enough for her. She was an exceptional student and could have had an exceptional career.\nBut she decided to stand by me and has been with me every moment over the past two decades and\nmore. There have been occasions when I have been away from home and haven\u2019t seen my kids, Sara\nand Arjun, for months. For example, soon after the  World Cup I suddenly realized that I hadn\u2019t\nnoticed that Arjun was almost my height. (He is in fact taller than me now.) There is no doubt I have\nmissed out on some really precious moments with my family. Such separations are part of a\nprofessional sportsman\u2019s life, of course, but I was only able to get through them because I always\nknew Anjali was there.\nAt the same time, I knew Anjali appreciated why I was away and was proud of what I was doing.\nShe is the one person I can turn to at all times, for whatever she says is always in my best interests.\nNot only has she given me critical feedback on key decisions; she has taken care of everything on the\ndomestic front. Starting with the kids, my mother, extended family, finances and a host of other\nissues, with Anjali in control I could focus on playing cricket. She is also my emotional rock, someone\nI turn to at every moment of self-doubt. There has never been any pressure on me to return home early\nfrom my engagements, for Anjali has always insisted that I should get back home only after I have\nfinished work to my satisfaction. Of course I regret that I couldn\u2019t spend more time with her and the\nkids during my cricket career, and I also appreciate more than I can say the understanding and support\nI have received from her and the children at all times. Finally, I have always cherished the advantages\nof having a doctor wife who has shielded me at times when I have been injured in the course of my\ncareer. YEARS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nIn March , after returning from the gruelling Australian tour and the World Cup, I badly needed a\nfew weeks of relaxation. Our next international assignment was a tour of South Africa towards the end\nof the year and we had several months off in the interim. Fortunately for me, I managed to spend the\nfirst few days at home. I played tennis-ball cricket with friends and it was terrific to be able to unwind\nin familiar surroundings.\nI was playing downstairs with my friends one day when Ajit called down from our apartment\nbalcony to say that there was a phone call from Yorkshire County Cricket Club and that they wanted\nme to play for them! I came up to take the call and was very excited at the offer. I did not bother\nasking about the contract and other details and was determined to make the most of this opportunity to\nplay in the County Championship in England. That I would have to cook, do my laundry, drive and\nperform all the other household chores never occurred to me at the time. A few days after the\nconversation, the CEO of Yorkshire CCC, Chris Hassell, came over to India to complete the\nformalities. We met at Thane, a suburb of Mumbai, where I was playing a match. I signed the contract\nat the ground, proud to become Yorkshire\u2019s first overseas-born player in  years.\n\nA Yorkshire lad\nI left for England towards the end of April , right after my nineteenth birthday, and stayed there\nfor three and a half months. It was my first long stint away from home on my own and it wasn\u2019t easy\ncoming from such a different cultural background, but the generosity and openness of my employers\nmade the stay immensely enriching and it was a great learning experience, to put it mildly.\nOne of the first problems was that I had little idea of the roads and had to follow my team-mate\nRichard Blakey as he drove to the ground. I was not really used to driving in England and often opted\nfor the fastest lane while driving to the ground. There were occasions when I missed an exit and also\nlost Richard in the process. It was difficult to turn back and I cursed myself for not staying in the\nslowest lane, where it would have been easier to see the exit. There were no mobile phones then and\ngetting lost meant I would be late for practice, which I hated.\nI had actually driven a little in England in  when I was there to play a few games of league\ncricket. Back then I stayed with the former India fast bowler Atul Wassan and he was generous enough\nto give me his car to drive around. He asked me if I had driven before and I assured him that I had\npassed all the tests and had an international licence and was confident of my driving skills. He said the\nkey to driving in the UK was not to use the brake much and just to follow the lanes. However, the very\nfirst day ended in disaster. I was in the fast lane when all of a sudden the car came to a halt. There was\nno power and the car would not restart, and I panicked when I saw a string of cars behind me. I told\nAtul, \u2018Gadi start nahi ho raha hai yaar!\u2019 (The car is not starting, my friend!) Atul initially thought I\n\n\fwas joking and asked me to accelerate. Anxious, I said to him that I was trying to, but there was no\npower and nothing was working. Only then did we realize that we had run out of fuel. Atul\nimmediately asked me to put on the hazard lights and in my state of nervousness it took me ages to\nfind the switch in the unfamiliar car. Finally, Atul put on the hazard lights for me. Somehow we got\nthe car onto the hard shoulder, then we called the AA and after a while a breakdown vehicle arrived.\nAnother problem was my complete lack of knowledge of English geography, which caused a\nnumber of blunders during my stay in Yorkshire. Some of these I now remember with fondness. One\nsuch was to commit myself to playing at opposite ends of the country on consecutive days. I had\nagreed to play in an India\u2013Pakistan festival match in London but had also committed to playing for a\nRest of the World XI versus England at Newcastle the following day. To add to my woes, the India\u2013\nPakistan match started at  p.m. and finished close to midnight. I had driven from Yorkshire to\nLondon for the early-evening start and by the time the match was over I was exhausted.\nAfterwards the other players were heading back to the hotel in London to relax and they asked me to\njoin them. When I said I had to leave for Newcastle because I was playing there the next day I could\nsee the shock and bewilderment on their faces. I had wrongly believed that it was easy to get from any\npart of England to another in two or three hours. It was only when they told me that it would take a\nminimum of six or seven hours to drive there that I realized the seriousness of the situation. I was\nadvised to leave for Newcastle straight away. I was stumped. I had left Yorkshire at one o\u2019clock that\nafternoon to get down to London, and here I was at midnight getting ready to drive all the way to\nNewcastle.\nJatin Paranjpe was with me at the time and we set off on the long drive together. Unfortunately, we\nhad little knowledge of the roads and were completely dependent on the signs. To add to our misery,\nwe missed a turn and ended up going south for close to thirty-five minutes when we should have been\ndriving north. It was just one of those nights.\nAfter driving for a couple of hours, my eyes started to give way. I asked Jatin to drive while I\nnapped to regain a bit of energy. Jatin did so and after a few minutes I took my turn in the driver\u2019s seat\nagain. A coffee break helped and eventually we reached the hotel at . a.m., only to see the team bus\nabout to leave for the ground. We were both pretty much out of it by then and desperately needed to\nclose our eyes. I walked up to the team manager and explained to him my plight and asked if he could\npossibly let me have twenty-five minutes of sleep. I promised to join the team at the ground in an\nhour. He was most kind and I set the alarm at exactly twenty-five minutes.\nWhen I woke up I didn\u2019t know where I was and felt like a complete zombie. I stumbled out of the\nhotel and made my way to the ground. I was sleepy and tired and was in no physical state to play a\nday\u2019s cricket. I still find it hard to believe, but somehow I managed to go out and make a hundred.\nAfter lunch, however, I could hardly stay awake and for the first time in my life I was taking tensecond naps between overs. I was actually sleeping while fielding and don\u2019t really know how I\nmanaged to get through the rest of the game.\nAs soon as the match was over Jatin and I rushed to the hotel. Our plan was to sleep for a couple of\nhours before joining the rest of the team for dinner. The next thing I remember is waking up in the\nearly hours of the morning. My first thought was that I had missed dinner. We tried calling room\nservice but no one picked up the call. We called Reception and were told that at that hour they\ncouldn\u2019t serve us any food. With no hope of food, we drank three glasses of water each and went back\nto bed, setting the alarm for  a.m., in plenty of time for breakfast. We did manage to get up in time\nfor breakfast and after eating a hearty meal of eggs and toast went to the ground to resume duty for the\nRest of the World XI. For all the exhaustion, I still managed to score some runs and must say that,\n\n\famidst all the chaos, the only thing that was going right was my batting.\nAfter the match Jatin and I decided to drive back to Yorkshire in the evening, so that I could rejoin\nmy county the following morning. This journey too was rather eventful. There were roadworks\neverywhere as we got out of Newcastle and the speed limit had been brought down to  mph from the\nnormal  mph. Given that it was fairly late, we decided to follow a police car that was in front of us,\nreckoning that as long as we followed a police car while maintaining a safe distance we would also be\nsafe.\nAfter a while I saw the police car making some sort of gesture to me. The driver had his hand out of\nthe window and had all five fingers stretched out. He then closed his fist before spreading his fingers\nagain. I thought he was asking me to put my lights on full beam and duly followed his instructions. A\nfew minutes later the police car put on its hazard lights and signalled us to stop.\nI was confused but did exactly as I was told. The policeman asked me if I had seen his earlier\nsignal. I said yes and told him that I had followed his instruction and turned on my lights. He said that\nwasn\u2019t what he had meant and explained that the signal was for me to slow down because I was\nspeeding. The police car was doing  mph while the speed limit had been set at  mph. As I\u2019d been\nmaintaining the same distance for the last hour and a half, I must have been speeding. He went on to\nsay that the reason he stretched his five fingers twice was to indicate to me that the speed limit was \nmph and I should slow down.\nI was taken aback and immediately confessed to my mistake, saying it wasn\u2019t intentional and that I\nwas blindly following the police car, believing it to be the safest option. In the interim the policeman\nhad seen the white rose and Yorkshire CCC printed on my car and asked what it meant. I informed\nhim that I played cricket for Yorkshire and it was a car given to me by the county. At this he asked my\nname and queried if I was indeed the first overseas professional to play for Yorkshire. I think it was\nmy identity that earned me a reprieve and I was let off with a warning that I should always keep the\nspeed limit in mind while driving.\n\nLife lessons\nAt Yorkshire we often played back-to-back matches and it helped me improve my batting a great deal.\nThe conditions were very different from those back home and I definitely matured as a batsman\nduring my time in county cricket. The ball would swing a greal deal more than in India and it allowed\nme to improve my technique and ability to adjust to different conditions. Over the years, the lessons\nlearnt from my stint at Yorkshire continued to help me whenever I toured England as part of the\nIndian team.\nSocially too it was a good learning experience. The authorities, including the president Sir\nLawrence Byford, were extremely sociable. The team had a great time and I particularly remember\nsome extremely interesting Sunday club bonding sessions. In one it was decided that everybody had to\nwear towels and a tie without a shirt and meet in the hotel\u2019s convention centre. At first I thought my\nteam-mates were pulling my leg and I wasn\u2019t prepared to dress up without seeing a few of the other\nplayers do so. I kept a close eye on the lobby and only when I saw a number of my team-mates\nsporting a towel and tie did I do the same. It turned out to be an eccentric but hilarious evening in the\nend.\nEveryone at Yorkshire knew I was only nineteen and they were always eager to help. This was just\nas well, because things were not at all what I was used to in Mumbai. I had toured England in , of\ncourse, but back then I had been with the Indian team and everything was arranged for us. This time I\n\n\fhad to do everything on my own \u2013 from organizing my own food to doing the laundry.\nCoping by myself sometimes caused me great embarrassment. One incident involved my first\nattempt to use a washing machine. I had no idea how much detergent was needed and must have\nemptied about half a packet into the machine before starting the washing cycle, then I went out. On\nmy way back I could see something oozing beneath my front door. I was shocked at first until I\nremembered that I had left the washing machine on. All the detergent had made it overflow and there\nwas foam everywhere.\nThat was the first and last time I did the laundry on my own. Every other time Solly bhai\u2019s family\nkindly came to my rescue. Solly Adams, who I fondly referred to as Solly bhai, was a resident of\nDewsbury in West Yorkshire. I had first met Solly and his wife Mariam in  in the company of\nDilip Vengsarkar. Every Mumbai cricketer who had played league cricket in England had spoken to\nme about Solly bhai\u2019s hospitality and it was natural that I should get in touch with him. His house had\nbecome a refuge for all Indian cricketers in the area and we all looked forward to the delectable food\nwe were served at Solly bhai\u2019s house, particularly the biryani, tandoori chicken, raita and mango lassi.\nIt soon became a ritual for me to visit him three times a week when I was in Yorkshire.\nSolly bhai\u2019s brother Younus and his wife Ruksana were also great hosts and it was from them that I\nlearnt the art of filling the salad bowl. When a few of my friends \u2013 Jatin Paranjpe, Mufi and Vinod\nKambli \u2013 came to stay with me in Yorkshire, we mostly survived on cheap fast food. As the only\nmember of the quartet who was earning, I would pay the bills and, with limited resources, fast food\nwas the most affordable option. We would eat out at KFC, Burger King and the like, but the all-youcan-eat buffet at Pizza Hut was our favourite. While we could eat as many pizzas as we wanted for a\nfixed price, we could only fill up our salad bowl once. And it was here that the training from Younus\nand Ruksana came in handy. They taught me to use lettuce leaves to construct a wall, so that the size\nof the bowl, which was ordinarily just two or three inches tall, increased to five or six inches. We\ncould then fill it with as much salad as we wanted.\nI finally left Yorkshire for India around mid-August, to get back in time for the Duleep Trophy,\nIndia\u2019s second most important domestic competition. It\u2019s named after Ranjitsinhji\u2019s nephew\nDuleepsinhji, who played for England in the early s, and features teams representing the\ncountry\u2019s five zones: West, North, South, East and Central, It was suggested that I should play in it\nbefore we left for what would be a challenging tour of South Africa in October. The Yorkshire\nmanagement was most considerate and allowed me to come back early, thus ending a really fruitful\nand productive time in county cricket.\n\nIndia in South Africa, November \u2013January \nIt was a historic tour because it was the first time the South Africans had played a Test series at home\nsince returning to the international fold in . They had toured India in November  to end their\ninternational isolation after twenty-one years and in the three one-day internationals showed they were\na very good side. In Allan Donald they had one of the best fast bowlers in the world and he was ably\nsupported by Richard Snell, Brian McMillan, Craig Matthews, Meyrick Pringle, Brett Schultz and a\nhost of other really good bowlers. In South African conditions the fast bowlers would pose a serious\nchallenge.\nThe United Cricket Board of South Africa had made every effort to make the tour memorable. We\nlanded in Durban and were immediately met by the hosts, who put us in open-top cars. There were two\ncricketers in each car and hordes of people lined the road as we made our way to the hotel. I was in a\n\n\fcar with Pravin Amre, a middle-order bat and another of Ramakant Achrekar\u2019s students, and\nremember listening to Kishore Kumar songs all the way to the hotel. It was a fabulous experience.\nWe played our first tour game against Nicky Oppenheimer\u2019s XI at his private ground in\nRandjesfontein. It had rained heavily before the start of the game and it looked highly unlikely that we\nwould get any cricket on the day. But I had underestimated our hosts and was totally taken aback to\nsee what they were pouring onto the pitch to dry it out. They actually burnt petrol on the pitch to\nexpedite the drying process, something I had never imagined could happen. That wasn\u2019t all. To our\nsurprise, a couple of helicopters hovered over the ground to dry the pitch for a good forty-five\nminutes. As a result of all this effort, the pitch was finally playable and we managed to get a game. I\nmade a hundred and we won the match easily, making a very good start to the tour. Afterwards, the\ntalk in the dressing room was that we would beat the South Africans easily. We carried this sense of\ncomplacency into the next match, where we scored over  runs against a Combined Bowl XI after\nbowling them out for . The tour was turning out to be a walk in the park.\nThings changed dramatically when we played the South African Board President\u2019s XI at Centurion\non  November . We bowled first and, standing at slip, I could see that the ball was not carrying\nthrough to the keeper. Manoj Prabhakar and Subroto Banerjee, a promising medium-fast swing bowler\nwith a terrific sense of humour, opened the bowling for us and neither generated much pace off the\nwicket. Apart from Srinath, who could bowl fast, none of our bowlers could get the ball to carry to the\nkeeper on that slowish track and we felt reasonably happy to get the opposition out for .\nAs our innings started we felt confident of batting the opposition out of the game again, but things\ndidn\u2019t quite go according to plan. The second over was bowled by Brett Schultz and he generated\nserious pace in his very first over; in fact, it was one of the quickest first overs I had seen. This wasn\u2019t\nwhat we had expected and within minutes the atmosphere in the dressing room had become very\nsubdued. The wicket had started to look lively and the batsmen were having all sorts of problems. It\nwasn\u2019t difficult to see that the Test series might not be so easy after all.\nDuring the match it rained a little and the drizzle had made the outfield slippery. As a nineteenyear-old full of energy, I decided it would be a good idea to use the rain to practise sliding, at the\nopposite end of the ground from the pavilion. Chamundeshwarnath, a former South Zone first-class\nplayer who was playing club cricket there, helped the Indian team in fielding practice and also gave\nme throw-downs in the nets. He was with me and was helping me with my drills. If under normal\ncircumstances I was able to slide for about three or four yards, the rain stupidly encouraged me to\nslide a few extra yards each time I chased a ball. In doing so I twisted my ankle and had to be carried\noff the ground. When I went to the hospital to get the injury checked, I was told it would take at least\nfour to five weeks to recover.\nWith the first Test still a week away, I was desperate to play a part in the series and pushed myself\nto get fit as quickly as possible. After a few days, I started to walk but I was still finding it difficult to\nrun. The team management was keen for me to play because I was batting well, but the only way I\ncould do so was by standing in the slips, where I did not have to do much running about. It eventually\nturned out to be quite embarrassing because there I was, a youngster, standing in the slips while Kapil\nDev, the senior member of the side, was running about in the deep.\nIn the first Test match at Durban, starting on  November , we batted well and remained\ncompetitive throughout the game, which ended in a draw. Pravin Amre scored a fantastic hundred on\ndebut and it was an innings full of character. I, unfortunately, wrote myself into the history books by\nbecoming the first batsman to be given out by the third umpire \u2013 the use of TV replays had just been\nintroduced. I had played the ball to point, where Jonty Rhodes was fielding. He was on it in a flash and\n\n\freturned it to the keeper in quick time. Still hampered by the ankle injury, I took a little extra time to\nturn back and, thanks to Jonty\u2019s brilliance, fell short by two or three inches. Just to be sure, umpire\nCyril Mitchley went to the third umpire, Karl Liebenberg, who declared me run out.\nIt was my first taste of Jonty Rhodes\u2019s fielding prowess, something that caused us problems for the\nwhole tour. Jonty was particularly effective in the ODI series and was undoubtedly the best fielder I\nplayed against. His anticipation and reactions were the quickest I have encountered and he managed to\ndry up all the singles around point, cover point and towards third man. On difficult pitches they can be\ncrucial runs and all of a sudden they had been cut off, with Jonty manning the entire area on the off\nside with amazing speed. He ran a number of us out and saved a lot of runs every game, making a\nsignificant difference to the outcome of the series.\nThe other thing about Jonty was his running between the wickets. In the third match of the ODI\nseries, which we won, Jonty had played a slog sweep off Ravi Shastri to deep square leg, where Kapil\nspilled the catch. In the interim Jonty had completed the first run really fast and had almost made it\nback to the striker\u2019s end, only to realize that his batting partner Andrew Hudson had not made any\nattempt to run a second. To our amazement, Jonty turned back and almost made it to the other end\nbefore the bails were dislodged to run him out. He had all but completed three runs in the time the\nnon-striker had managed just one.\nComing back to the Test series, we followed the Durban draw with another good performance in the\nsecond Test at Johannesburg, which started on  November. I got a hundred in this game, my fourth\nin Test cricket. It is an innings I remember with great satisfaction. I was not out on  at the end of the\nsecond day and had to fight really hard on the third morning. Allan Donald was bowling a brilliant\nspell and patience was the key to survival. I kept leaving balls outside the off stump and knew I had to\nsee Donald off before I was able to get on with scoring. I played just one cover drive before lunch,\notherwise it was a battle of attrition and patience. That memorable contest against Allan Donald\ntypefies what Test cricket is all about for me, making it the pinnacle of all formats of the sport. Here\nwas a fast bowler propelling the ball at close to  kph. For a batsman there\u2019s nothing more\nchallenging than really hostile fast bowling in bowler-friendly conditions. You don\u2019t get to play spells\nlike that in domestic cricket and surviving is a true test of a batsman\u2019s calibre.\nAt Johannesburg, I finally got to my hundred after lunch, facing  balls in the innings, which\nlasted for six and a half hours. With Kumble taking six wickets in South Africa\u2019s second innings, we\nmanaged to draw the match and went into the third Test at Port Elizabeth with all to play for. The\nother bowler who bowled very well for South Africa was Craig Matthews. He was the most accurate of\nthe lot and bowled a crafty line outside off stump, from where the ball would generally swing away.\nOccasionally he would get one to nip back and it was difficult to play this incoming ball. So much so\nthat almost the whole team ended up with very similar black bruises on our thighs after being hit by\nMatthews. We even joked about it in the dressing room, saying, \u2018 Aare isko bhi medal mila hai dekh!\u2019\n(He too has got a medal. Check!)\nUnfortunately, we lost the third Test at Port Elizabeth to the pace and guile of Allan Donald, who\npicked up twelve wickets in the match. We were still in the game at the end of the first innings of both\nteams, but it was Donald\u2019s opening burst in the second innings that made all the difference. We lost\nour first six wickets for  and, despite a brilliant hundred from Kapil Dev, we never really had a\nchance. I got a bad umpiring call and was declared out to Brett Schultz, caught behind, when the ball\nhad actually hit the inside of my thigh. The umpire met me at the end of the game and apologized for\ngetting it wrong. It was understandable, for umpiring is one of the most difficult jobs in cricket and it\nis only human to get things wrong sometimes.\n\n\fWe were determined to level the series in the fourth and final Test match at Cape Town, which\nstarted on  January . While we failed to achieve that, we didn\u2019t play badly. Javagal Srinath\nbowled particularly impressively, picking up six wickets. This time Allan Donald bowled a lot of\novers to me from round the wicket, pitching it short of a length to make the most of the spongy bounce\nCape Town is known for. I decided to try a new approach. He was bowling short and was getting the\nballs to come into my body. I realized that the best way to counter him would be to frustrate him. My\nthinking was simple: if taller guys can use their height to stand up on their toes and get on top of the\nbounce, why shouldn\u2019t the shorter guys use their height to go under the ball. So I decided to change\nmy stance in this match. Normally I used to leave a gap of ten inches to a foot between my feet while\nbatting, but in Cape Town I increased the gap to two and a half feet. This meant I was effectively even\nshorter than normal and could easily get under Donald\u2019s deliveries, forcing him to change the length\nhe was bowling. It proved successful and I managed to bat for more than four and a half hours, facing\n balls for my , which helped us draw the game.\nIn the ODI series, which for some reason was played between the second and third Tests and which\nfor the first time was played with two new balls, one from each end, we gave a good account of\nourselves, despite losing the seven-game contest \u2013. Most of the matches were low-scoring and \nor thereabouts was considered a competitive score, which seems extraordinary these days.\nWe had lost to South Africa in both formats but I must say I had relished the challenge of playing\nagainst some of the best fast bowlers in the world. Every side faces difficulties away from home and\nat the end of the tough South Africa series we were looking forward to dishing out a few challenges to\nGraham Gooch\u2019s England when they toured India in February\u2013March . Remarkably, it would be\nmy first ever Test series on home soil.\n\nEngland in India, January\u2013March \nThere\u2019s nothing quite like playing in front of home crowds and in home conditions. When the first\nTest at Eden Gardens in Kolkata started on  January , the enthusiasm among the spectators\nacted as huge motivation. Mohammad Azharuddin, our skipper, who always relished playing at Eden\nGardens, set the tone with a brilliant , while I managed a half-century. By the fifth day we needed\njust  to win and to my complete amazement , people had come to the stadium to see us knock\noff the winning runs and take a \u2013 lead in the three-Test series. I remember hitting a short ball from\nPaul Jarvis, the England fast bowler, over square leg to the boundary to win the game.\nBack in the dressing room there was no holding back. We really needed that win after the\ndisappointment in South Africa and it felt particularly great to see the spinners come into play in\nconditions that suited their art. The English batsmen I had seen hitting through the line in England in\n were now struggling against the turning ball. The boot was on the other foot and we were\nenjoying every moment of it. Playing spin in the subcontinent is quite a challenge and England were\nfinding it very difficult. We had a three-pronged spin attack in Anil Kumble, Rajesh Chauhan and\nVenkatapathy Raju \u2013 a lethal threesome. With the fast bowlers Kapil Dev and Manoj Prabhakar both\nvery able with the bat, we had the flexibility to go in with five bowlers, making our attack look that\nmuch more potent.\nThe second match of the series started in Chennai on  February and it was in this match that I got\nmy first home Test hundred. The surface, a very good track to bat on, was hard with a little bit of\nbounce. I scored  and could easily have gone on to score a double ton if I hadn\u2019t played a\ndisappointingly loose shot to Ian Salisbury, the leg-spinner. I had set out to hit the ball over midwicket\n\n\fand ended up top-edging it back to the bowler.\nNavjot Sidhu also made a century and we posted a sizable total of . Despite some resistance\nfrom Neil Fairbrother in their first innings, England were forced to follow on. Chris Lewis put up a\ngood fight in the second innings, making his maiden century, but Kumble took six wickets and we\nended up winning the match comfortably. We headed to Mumbai for the third Test four days later,\nhaving already taken an unassailable \u2013 lead in the series.\nThis was to be my first Test match at the Wankhede Stadium, where I had grown up playing a lot of\nmy cricket, and hence it was a homecoming of sorts. It was the same for Vinod Kambli, who got a\nspectacular double hundred in this match. England must have been reasonably pleased to post their\nbiggest total of the series in their first innings, , with Graeme Hick making his highest Test score\nof . Yet we posted an impressive  in reply, of which I contributed , and then Manoj\nPrabhakar took three quick wickets and the spinners did the rest, handing the English another innings\ndefeat. It\u2019s fair to say that we had successfully put the disappointment of South Africa behind us.\nAnil Kumble, who had bowled beautifully in all three Test matches, was declared Player of the\nSeries. Anil was becoming the match-winner we had been looking for and discipline and rigour were\nthe hallmarks of his craft. He did not turn the ball much but made up for it with great accuracy and\ntenacity. I never saw Anil let up in intensity and have nothing but the highest regard for him, one of\nthe greatest players to have represented India.\nThe ODI series was more closely contested and we went into the last match at Gwalior on  March\n needing to win to level the series. Up till then, I had had a mediocre run batting at number five or\nsix. However, at Gwalior I managed to score a quick  off thirty balls at a crucial time in the game\nand was involved in a key partnership with Azhar, who scored a brilliant  not out as he took us to\nvictory.\nThe England series marked the beginning of a very successful phase in Indian cricket. We followed\nup by beating Zimbabwe in a one-off Test at home and were gradually getting into a healthy winning\nhabit in home conditions. In ODIs we had started winning close contests and we went into the next\nmajor one-day tournament \u2013 the Hero Cup, also featuring South Africa, Sri Lanka, the West Indies and\nZimbabwe \u2013 as one of the favourites.\n\nTurning my arm over\nNot long before the Hero Cup I played a festival match in Bangalore. When Kiran More, normally a\nwicketkeeper, bowled me a juicy full toss I tried to hit it for six but ended up twisting my wrist. It was\na freakish injury and while I was able to continue batting, I was in serious pain. After a few days the\ninjury had still not eased and it was decided that I needed to have an injection. This was my first\ncortisone injection and Dr Anant Joshi flew in from Mumbai to Delhi to administer the shot. I was to\nbe injected on my wrist very close to the palm, and with the Hero Cup just days away, I was\napprehensive about the recovery. The injection, which was pretty painful, was the first of a hundred or\nmore cortisone injections over the course of my career.\nThe one match of the Hero Cup I will never forget is the semi-final against South Africa on \nNovember . We batted first, scoring a very modest  in our fifty overs. We knew we needed to\nbowl and field exceedingly well if we were to stop South Africa from making the final. Our bowlers,\nled by Anil, did a very good job and at the end of the forty-ninth over South Africa needed six runs to\nwin. Having made a match of it despite scoring too few runs, we now had to decide who should be\nentrusted with the task of bowling the all-important final over.\n\n\fI volunteered to take the responsibility. I had not bowled on the day and so I thought my bowling\nwould have a surprise element to it. Also, the track had assisted the slower bowlers and Kapil\u2019s pace\nmight have been easier for the South African batsmen to deal with. Then I realized that after fielding\nfor forty-nine overs and in the slightly nippy evening, my body was stiff and my hands were frozen. I\nknew I had to warm up again quickly because there was no second chance. One wide could mean the\nmatch was over.\nThe first ball was a good-length delivery to Brian McMillan, one of the best all-rounders in the\nworld at the time, who managed a single. But in the process South Africa lost Fanie de Villiers, who,\nin trying to get McMillan back on strike, was run out by a throw from Salil Ankola. Importantly, it\nmeant that McMillan was at the non-striker\u2019s end and the new man was facing me. This was my\nopportunity. Allan Donald, the new batsman, wasn\u2019t great with the bat and if I managed to pin him\ndown we definitely had a chance of winning the contest. The key was to keep the big-hitting Brian\nMcMillan away from the strike.\nAs Donald walked to the wicket, I knew he was feeling the tension. I just had to hold my nerve and\nnot try anything fancy. I deliberately bowled slower to him and even tossed one up, giving it a bit of\nspin. Donald was unable to cope with the lack of pace and ended up putting himself and his team\nunder pressure by playing out three dot-balls. He didn\u2019t manage a single till the fifth ball of the over.\nSouth Africa now needed a boundary off the last ball to win. For our part, we just needed to stop the\nboundary and we were in the final.\nThe key to handling pressure situations like these is to keep yourself steady, follow your instincts\nand think clearly. I was aware that there had been occasions in the past when a batsman had got an\ninside edge attempting a huge heave and the ball had beaten the keeper standing up and sped to the\nboundary. In such circumstances there\u2019s little the bowling team can do. Remembering this, I asked\nVijay Yadav, our keeper, to stand back, as if to a fast bowler.\nIt\u2019s difficult to believe, looking back, but McMillan did try a slog and he did get an inside edge.\nYadav easily picked up the ball twenty yards back and South Africa could only sneak a single. In the\nmost dramatic of finishes we had managed to win and were in the final. I had conceded only three runs\nin the over and we had won by two runs. The packed Eden Gardens crowd, which numbered close to\n,, turned hysterical. Paper torches were lit all round the stands, creating an unbelievable\natmosphere. I felt a sense of exhilaration and was soon engulfed by my team-mates. It was one of the\nbest one-day internationals I had played in.\nThe other, rather unexpected, contributor to the Indian victory was a mongoose, which kept coming\nonto the ground during the second half of this day-night encounter at the Eden Gardens. It seemed that\nevery time the mongoose came on the field the momentum shifted and the South Africans lost a\nwicket. While it was just a coincidence, of course, it turned out to be a lucky coincidence for India!\nAfter such a nerve-racking semi-final, the final was a relatively easy affair, with Anil running\nthrough the West Indies line-up to give us the title. He bowled brilliantly and finished off with careerbest figures of \u2013 as we won the Hero Cup in front of a packed Eden Gardens. To make the victory\neven sweeter, I managed to get the wicket of Brian Lara. Getting Brian Lara out was interesting\nbecause Ajit, who had travelled to Kolkata with me to watch the semi-final and the final, had\nmentioned to me in the hotel that I should look to get Brian Lara out if I got a chance to bowl to him,\nand also suggested that I should bowl stump to stump to him. As it happened, I did get a chance to\nbowl to Brian, who had opened the batting for the West Indies. After he had hit me for a few runs, I\nbowled him a delivery slightly outside the off stump, which nipped back in a shade and bowled him.\nDelighted with the wicket, I immediately thought of the discussion I had had with Ajit.\n\n\fMy first year of cricket on home soil had gone really well. However, there were still things I\ndesperately wanted to do. One was getting my first ODI hundred and another was opening the batting\nfor India in one-dayers.\n\nIndia in New Zealand, March\u2013April \nIt was the morning of  March  and later that day we were playing New Zealand in the second\ngame of a four-match ODI series in Auckland. Navjot Sidhu, our first-choice opener, woke up with a\nstiff neck and was in no position to play. That\u2019s when I went up to Azhar and our manager Ajit\nWadekar, a former Indian captain and a leading batsman of his time, and pleaded with them to give\nme an opportunity at the top of the order. Why did I think I should open? Well, I had the ability to\nattack bowlers and play shots from the word go, and in the one-day game, the key was to take\nadvantage of the field restrictions in the first fifteen overs. I was sure that I just needed a chance to\nprove myself. I told Wadekar Sir that if I failed I\u2019d never ask him again. In any case, there was no\nreserve opener in the team and they had no choice but to experiment with an irregular opener in place\nof Sidhu. If they put me at the top, they could still get a middle-order batsman to fill in for me at\nnumber four or five. After a lot of pleading, they finally agreed.\nNew Zealand scored just  batting first, but we still needed to make a good start. As I walked out\nto bat, I felt different in some way. I told myself that this was my big chance to open the batting for\nIndia. I did not want to let down the captain and the coach. Once I was at the wicket I cleared my mind\nand was just intent on hitting the ball hard, come what may. It was one of those days when everything\nfell into place and soon I couldn\u2019t wait for the next delivery. The quicker the better, as far as I was\nconcerned. I managed to score  off forty-eight balls, finally holing out to the left-arm spinner\nMatthew Hart off a leading edge. I had hit fifteen fours and two sixes.\nAfter that I no longer had to plead with Wadekar Sir to allow me to open and I continued to score\nruns in that position for the rest of the series, which ended up being tied \u2013. It was no surprise\nbecause New Zealand at home were always formidable opponents. In this series, I was able to dictate\nterms to the bowlers and all my plans were working out well. For example, against Gavin Larsen,\nknown to be a bowler who bowled a stump-to-stump line, I came down the wicket a couple of times,\nforcing him to adjust his length. When he bowled short I was waiting for it and promptly dispatched\nthe ball to the stands.\nWith one aim achieved, I was determined to accomplish the second as soon as possible. I had\nstarted to feel frustrated and a little embarrassed at not having scored a hundred in ODI cricket.\nHaving already played seventy-odd games, it was about time. The moment finally came against\nAustralia in Sri Lanka in the Singer World Series in September  and it was more of a relief than\nanything else. So much of getting to a century is in the mind. Once you score one, you know you can\nscore another and the doubts aren\u2019t there any more \u2013 getting the first one is the tricky bit. My first\nODI hundred certainly soothed the nerves and it was an important milestone in my career.\n\nPlaying against Brian Lara\nWith five years of experience, I was now firmly established in the Indian team and people had started\ncomparing me with other players on the international scene at the time. The press love to set up\nrivalries and with a home series against the West Indies coming up at the end of , it was\ninevitable that the fans and the media would pit me against Brian Lara.\n\n\fWithout doubt Brian Lara is one of the best players to have played this sport. I first met Brian in\nNovember  during a festival match in Toronto between the West Indies and a World XI, which\nwas played at the SkyDome, a stadium designed for Major League Baseball. We got along straight\naway and I enjoyed talking to him and listening to his insights. He was a clear thinker and had an\nexcellent grasp of the nuances of the game. To add to his unrivalled flamboyance, he also had great\nhands and footwork, making him a champion batsman of our time. Brian was capable of playing a\nnumber of shots to the same delivery and his ability to adjust at the last moment set him apart. His\ntechnique wasn\u2019t orthodox but that had never mattered to him. He more than made up for it with skill\nand footwork.\nBy the time the West Indies came to India in November\u2013December , Brian was already the\npremier batsman of his team. We knew we had to stop Brian from scoring to have a chance in the Test\nseries, but it was easier said than done, and Brian played a very important role for the West Indies in\nthe third and final Test at Mohali. It was his innings of  that set the platform for a series-levelling\nWest Indies win. For the visitors, Jimmy Adams too played a crucial part, with  runs in the match.\nI had a pretty good series and in the first match at Mumbai I was pleased with my performance in\nthe second innings, scoring  after coming in to bat at a precarious \u2013. We won the match by \nruns, having managed to get Brian out early in both innings. In the second Test at the VCA stadium in\nNagpur, I scored  in our first innings. I remember this innings for my wild celebrations after\nscoring the century, something I hardly ever did in my career. In fact, it was an aberration, caused by a\ncombination of factors. I was not out on  overnight and started the second day against the second\nnew ball. I hit Kenneth Benjamin for four fours in the first few overs and raced to  in no time.\nCourtney Walsh was bowling from the other end and I was trying to get into his mind, to understand\nwhat he was likely to do. I had a feeling he would bowl outside off stump or full if he wanted to get\nme out. On the other hand, he would probably bowl bouncers if he just wanted to keep me quiet. He\nbowled a short ball and that\u2019s when I realized that another one might be coming my way the very next\ndelivery. I was ready. I played the hook to perfection and the ball sailed into the stands. It was an\nexhilarating way to get to a century and I just couldn\u2019t control my emotions. I pumped my fists and\nscreamed in joy, though none of it was meant for Walsh. It was simply because my plan had come off.\n\nFacing criticism\nThe story of this series against the West Indies remains incomplete if I don\u2019t talk about the five-match\nODI series that preceded the Tests in October and November . It was played in two parts. The\nfirst two ODIs were followed by a tri-series, with New Zealand joining India and the West Indies as\nthe third team, before we went back to playing the last three games of the bilateral series.\nIn both of the first two ODIs against the West Indies, on  and  October, I was out without\nscoring. I didn\u2019t do much better in the first match of the tri-series, on  October, making only eight.\nAfter just three failures, a surprising number of people started to find flaws with my game. While they\nmight have been well-intentioned, it seemed that every ex-cricketer I met during the tri-series had\nsome advice for me. Everyone was trying to tell me what was wrong with my game, which I found a\nlittle strange.\nYes, I had scored two consecutive ducks, but this reaction was extraordinary. Every performer goes\nthrough lean patches. I was still at ease with myself and knew that with one good score, things would\nfall back into place. That\u2019s exactly what happened in the final of the tri-series, when I scored  at\nEden Gardens. That was followed by three consecutive half-centuries in the bilateral series,\n\n\fculminating in a hundred in the final game at Jaipur on  November. I ended up as Player of the\nSeries.\nHaving won the tri-series and also the five-match ODI series, we had given our fans a lot to cheer\nabout. Coming on top of the Hero Cup win a year earlier, all these victories helped boost the\npopularity of ODI cricket in India ahead of the World Cup, which was being co-hosted by India,\nPakistan and Sri Lanka in . It was set to be a massive event.\nIndia in South Africa \u2013\nst Test.

    "1994-1998": " WORLD CUP \n\nOur preparations for the World Cup began with a training camp in Bangalore in January . For\nsome reason, it had been decided by the management that it would be a good idea for the team to run\nfrom the hotel to the Chinnaswamy Stadium every morning, with the team bus and security cars\ntrailing behind. I still don\u2019t understand the logic behind this bright idea or why somebody came up\nwith it in the first place. None of us were used to road running and injuries were bound to happen. I\nended up with a sore shin on the very first day, while a number of other guys had problems with their\nbacks and hamstrings.\nA joke started doing the rounds in the dressing room about whether we would be fielding on the\nroad or on the cricket field. We were all prepared to run as much as they liked on grass, but there was\nno point risking injuries by running on hard roads just weeks before the World Cup. A few players\nsuggested calculating the distance between the hotel and the ground and running the same distance\ninside the stadium instead. The management listened to what we had to say and road running was\nquickly abandoned. Our World Cup preparations started in earnest the following morning.\nDuring the camp we would get to the ground by  a.m. and stay there till  p.m. The sessions were\nlong and draining and I made sure to have a big breakfast to keep up my energy levels. I was only\ntwenty-three in  and could digest everything I ate. Every morning I would have four fried eggs\nsunny side up, with ketchup and tabasco sauce, making two sandwiches of the four eggs, which I just\nloved. The breakfast would keep me going for hours and I thoroughly enjoyed the long training\nsessions. In the evenings we spent time in the pool or in the gym and soon all the players were looking\nforward to the tournament. No team had won the cup on home soil and it was our chance to make\nhistory.\n\nGroup stages, February\u2013March \nOur first match was against Kenya at Cuttack in Odisha in Eastern India on  February and we won\nthe match comfortably. I scored a hundred and was Man of the Match. We then moved on to Gwalior\nin the west of the country to play the West Indies three days later, confident of sustaining the\nmomentum. While February in the east of India can be nippy, in the west the temperatures can touch\n degrees during the day. I had a fever the night before the West Indies game but still played and\ncontributed  to our victory, which was set up by some fine bowling by Prabhakar and Kumble once\nagain. Early on in my innings Courtney Browne, the West Indies wicketkeeper, dropped a skier at\nshort square leg and I was able to make the most of my reprieve.\nHaving won our first two games, we played Australia in Mumbai on  February, determined to\nupstage the tournament favourites. Australia batted well and put up a competitive , riding on a\nbrilliant innings from Mark Waugh, the younger of the Waugh twins, who scored . We did not\n\n\fbegin the chase well and lost two early wickets to Damien Fleming, who bowled well throughout the\ntournament. That\u2019s when I tried to counter-attack, to get on top of Glenn McGrath and Fleming.\nI managed to establish control and was going really well until the Australians gave the ball to Mark\nWaugh to have a go with his off-spin. I immediately picked up a couple of runs to square leg, followed\nby a sweep for four. As I\u2019d hoped, the deep midwicket fielder was moved slightly towards square leg.\nSpace at midwicket meant I could now go over the top for a boundary. Seeing me jump out, Mark\nWaugh bowled a wide ball. I couldn\u2019t reach it and was out stumped for . I have to admit I had been\nout-thought. It was a key moment in the game and we soon lost control amid a flurry of wickets. It\nwas dispiriting to lose the match from a winning position.\n\nLooking after my interests\nAn odd thing happened during the break between innings in that Australia game. At the time, I was\nperhaps the only Indian player who was playing without a bat sponsor. Most players had \u2018Four Square\u2019\nor \u2018Wills\u2019 on their bats, but my determination not to endorse a tobacco brand meant I was playing\nwithout a bat sticker. A few months before the tournament started, a leading multinational, which had\njust entered India, had approached me but talks had not progressed much. I had quoted an amount to\nthem to which they did not agree. I was therefore surprised when, in the middle of the game, the\nmanaging director of this company came over to meet me and suggested that if I put his company\u2019s\nsticker on my bat there and then, they would pay me any amount I wanted.\nI turned down the offer. I was clear I wanted no distractions in the middle of a tournament. I did not\nwant an alien element on my bat, something I had not come to terms with, to catch my eye while I was\nbatting. It might have affected my rhythm. I said I would put a sticker on my bat when I wanted to and\nnot when I was asked to do so. I had done well without a bat sticker up till then and, like most\nsportsmen (though not all care to acknowledge it), I was superstitious about such things. I did not want\nto risk making changes when I was batting well. The bat sticker could wait.\nTowards the closing stages of the tournament, my friend and manager Mark Mascarenhas, head of\nthe sports management company WorldTel, mentioned to me that he had lined up MRF, the wellknown Indian car tyre brand, as a bat sponsor but the deal would only come into effect after the\ntournament. Mark, who was based in Connecticut and had made a name for himself by winning the\ntelevision rights of the  World Cup, knew my concerns well and never pushed me into doing\nanything against my wishes. His ability to understand and appreciate my issues made him a really\nspecial person. Mark was more a friend than a manager and I was able to trust him fully with all my\nneeds. While he changed the nature of player endorsements in cricket by bringing a string of major\ncorporates to the table, he did so without ever forcing a particular endorsement on me.\nI first met Mark in Sri Lanka in  and it was Ravi Shastri who introduced us. Ravi said to me\nthat here was a man who could shake things up and had a very interesting proposition for me. As soon\nas I met him I was impressed by his professionalism and attention to detail. Mark never left anything\nto chance. We were really close and even went on a couple of family holidays together. On one of\nthese holidays, to Coonoor in South India, we had a fantastic time eating all the local delicacies and\nplaying golf. Mark was another foodie and I have fond memories of the many fantastic meals we had\ntogether in his house in Connecticut in  when I spent a week there. I was totally shocked when I\nfirst heard about his fatal car accident at Kharbi, not far from Nagpur in central India in , and\nmust say I lost a very close friend and confidant. We worked wonderfully well together and it is\nimpossible to fill the void created by his untimely death.\n\n\fAfter Mark was gone a number of agents approached me and expressed an interest in managing my\naffairs. However, my relationship with Mark was such that it never occurred to me to leave WorldTel.\nAnd I am happy to say I have been proved right, with Vinod Naidu, my current manager and friend,\ntaking care of my affairs for a decade and more, first on behalf of WorldTel and then on behalf of\nWSG (World Sport Group). I first met Vinod in Sharjah in  and then in London over a delicious\nlunch at my favourite Thai restaurant, Patara, when Mark introduced the two of us. It was after Mark\u2019s\nuntimely demise that Vinod and I started working closely together. We spoke to each other regularly\nand, like Mark, Vinod soon came to understand and respect my concerns. It was always clear to him\nthat my cricket was my top priority. Between Mark and Vinod, I have been lucky to have two great\npeople to work with. In fact, it would perhaps not be wrong to say that I have spent more days with\nVinod than anyone else in the professional realm over the last decade and I have enjoyed every bit of\nit. Vinod knows me inside out and has been a constant presence whenever I needed him. To spend so\nmuch time away from his family in order to manage my interests is evidence of his commitment to his\nprofession, and his is another friendship I deeply cherish.\n\nPakistan again\nThe quarter-final against Pakistan on  March  was by far the biggest match of the World Cup.\nThere was tremendous security around the team hotel and we knew that the nation would be watching.\nThat was not so unusual for an India\u2013Pakistan match, but the World Cup had added a further\ndimension to this particular knock-out encounter. On the day of the match we reached the ground early\nand found the atmosphere at the Chinnaswamy Stadium to be truly unbelievable. The stadium was\npacked hours before the game and the crowd was loud and boisterous.\nWe batted first and I was the first to get out for  to Ata-ur-Rehman, the Pakistan fast bowler,\ntrying to steer the ball to third man. Navjot Sidhu, who opened the batting with me, batted well for his\n and Ajay Jadeja played a fantastic cameo towards the end, scoring  off twenty-five balls to get us\nto a very respectable  in our fifty overs.\nPakistan started brightly in response and raced to  in their first ten overs. We badly needed a\nwicket to keep the scoring in check and that\u2019s when a famous incident took place involving Aamer\nSohail, the Pakistan opener, and Venkatesh Prasad, our fast-medium bowler. Sohail had hit Venky for\na boundary towards point and suggested rather aggressively that that was where he wanted to keep\nVenky all day. He waved his bat towards the boundary and said a number of rather rude things. Venky,\nunderstandably angry, bowled him with his very next ball. It was sweet revenge. Having got his man,\nit was now his turn and he showed Aamer Sohail the way to the dressing room.\nThe team was pumped up after this incident and we soon took control of the match. Prasad picked\nup two more crucial wickets and Ajay Jadeja and I bowled ten reasonably tight overs between us in the\nmiddle, while Kumble chipped in with three wickets. In what turned out to be his final international\ninnings, Javed Miandad was run out for , ending a glorious career for Pakistan. Despite some good\nlate hitting by wicketkeeper Rashid Latif, which caused us a bit of a panic, we were on the ascendancy\nthroughout and in the end won the match fairly comfortably, by  runs, prompting celebrations all\nover the country.\nOn our way back to the hotel we could see people lining the streets and they were throwing garlands\nand flowers at the team bus. In the hotel too we were being treated differently. We stayed on in\nBangalore for one extra day and spent a relaxed few hours in the pool the next afternoon. We could\nsense that the staff were trying to please us and were looking at us differently. They were looking after\n\n\four every need and when somebody ordered prawns, three different varieties were served, all on the\nhouse. We were being treated like royalty and it felt wonderful to see the country so happy and proud.\n\nThings fall apart\nWe were due to play Sri Lanka in the semi-final at Eden Gardens on  March. We arrived in Kolkata\ntwo days before and the first thing that struck us on landing at the airport was the security. There were\ncommandos everywhere and no fans were allowed near the hotel lobby. This was no ordinary match.\nSomeone had mentioned to us that the surface at Eden Gardens had been relaid with soil brought\nover from Australia. The first look at the surface seemed to support this statement, with the pitch\napparently hard and firm. In fact, it did look like a typical Australian wicket. On that basis, it was\nunanimously decided that we should field first if we won the toss, particularly because Sri Lanka had\nchased very well throughout the tournament. Their openers, Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh\nKaluwitharana, had been going for the bowling in the first fifteen overs and had given them fantastic\nstarts in most matches. They had beaten us in the pool stage of the competition and it was important to\ntake early wickets and put them under pressure.\nWe won the toss and put the Sri Lankans in and got off to a great start, picking up Sanath for one\nand Kalu for zero. They both got out playing cut shots to third man, vindicating our belief that the\nwicket was hard and firm. It was only when I came on to bowl that I realized we had misread the\nwicket. The ball started to hold up and was stopping on the batsmen. The top layer might have been\nfirm enough, but immediately below the surface it was loose. It would clearly not last the full hundred\novers and it became even more important to keep Sri Lanka down to a manageable score. Though we\nmanaged to restrict Sri Lanka to  in their fifty overs, that proved far too many in the end.\nWhen it was our turn to bat the wicket had started doing all sorts of things. The ball was turning and\nholding up and batting was extremely difficult. Opening, I scored  but got out rather strangely to a\nball from Sanath Jayasuriya. He was bowling left-arm orthodox spin and the ball hit my pad and rolled\noff to the on side. I thought there was a quick single and stepped out of the crease. Too late, I saw that\nthe ball had stopped very close to Kaluwitharana, the keeper, and there was no way I could finish the\nrun, but by then it was too late. He dislodged the stumps in a flash and I didn\u2019t bother waiting for the\nthird umpire\u2019s decision because I knew I was out. It was a long and frustrating walk back to the\npavilion and I could sense it would not be easy for the batsmen who followed.\nSure enough, we soon lost wickets in a heap, handing Sri Lanka the game. The crowd, desperate for\nan Indian victory, grew increasingly restless and disrupted the game by throwing things onto the field.\nBy then, however, the match was all over. Our World Cup dream lay shattered and there was a deathly\nsilence in the dressing room.\nThis time the journey from the ground to the hotel was painful and when we reached the hotel we\nrealized that everything had changed. We were made to feel as if we had done something seriously\nwrong. There was no doubt we had let our fans down, but we were hurting as much as anybody. It was\na long and difficult night as we sat around picking over the way the match had played out.\nWe left Kolkata by the first available flight the following morning and I still found it difficult to\naccept that Sri Lanka and not India would be travelling to Pakistan to play in the World Cup final\nagainst Australia. We had done so well to win the quarter-final against Pakistan, the high point of our\nWorld Cup. Personally, I had had a good tournament and ended up with the most runs in the\ncompetition \u2013 , with two centuries and three half-centuries \u2013 but that was of little consolation. Our\nbiggest mistake was misreading the Eden Gardens pitch. That is what cost us the game.\n\n\fIndian cricket was not going through a good phase. With the World Cup dream over, team morale\nwas low and we had little time to recover before a difficult tour of England, which we lost \u2013, though\nwe did discover two superb talents in Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly along the way. Though I\nscored a couple of centuries in this series, at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge, and Sourav scored two\nconsecutive hundreds, on debut at Lord\u2019s and at Trent Bridge, we weren\u2019t able to make our way back\nafter losing the first of the three Tests. The England bowlers, led by Chris Lewis, Dominic Cork and\nAlan Mullally, did well throughout the series and run-scoring was never easy. Nasser Hussain, the\nEngland skipper, also had a good series, leading from the front all the way.\nOff the pitch, one incident from this tour is difficult to forget. Sourav Ganguly and Navjot Sidhu\nwere travelling on the Tube in London when a few young guys, who\u2019d probably had a bit too much to\ndrink, boarded the train. For some reason they started making gestures at Sourav and Navjot and\neventually one of them threw a beer can at Navjot, who promptly stood up to confront them. It turned\nugly and a fight ensued, until the train reached the next station, where their attackers staggered off \u2013\nbut then one of them came back onto the train and started waving a gun at Navjot. At this, Sourav\u2019s\nfirst reaction was to drop to the ground and cover his face in fright, but then he started pleading with\nthe boy and dragged Navjot away as quickly as he could. Looking back at the incident, it seems a\nfunny scene in some ways, but it must have been pretty scary at the time!\nSoon after returning to India after a generally disappointing tour of England on the field, I was\nmade captain of India at the age of twenty-three, replacing Azhar, who had been captain since . It\nwas time for the team to make a fresh start and get back to winning ways as soon as possible.\nIndia in the  World Cup\nth match. India v Kenya at Cuttack.

I had captained Mumbai and led them to victory in the Ranji Trophy in \u2013. In all, I\ncaptained Mumbai in sixteen out of the thirty-eight Ranji Trophy matches I played in, and I continued\nto do well as a batsman in these games, scoring at an average of .. I had also captained West Zone\nin the Duleep Trophy, so it wasn\u2019t an altogether new experience. Yet captaining India is\nfundamentally different, with its own particular challenges.\nFirst, there is the need to cope with the demands of the non-stop media machine. The Indian\ncaptain\u2019s every move is headline news and it was no easy task to protect myself from the constant\nmedia glare. More important, perhaps, was learning how to deal with the selection committee and the\npractice of zonal representation associated with it.\nIn India the committee consists of five selectors, one from each zone: West, North, South, East and\nCentral. Zonal representation sometimes resulted in selectors pushing players from their particular\nzone and in my first stint as captain the team undoubtedly suffered as a consequence. There were\noccasions when I wasn\u2019t given the team of my choice and did not get particular players I asked for.\nFor me, the priority was always the Indian team. For some of the selectors, however, things may have\nbeen different. I felt there were other factors dictating team selection and at times I felt disappointed\nafter selection committee meetings.\n\nA promising start\nMy first match as captain was against Australia at the Kotla in New Delhi in October , and we\nwere keen to bounce back after the series defeat in England in the summer. We also needed to win the\nTest to keep our amazing home Test record intact. We managed to do so, with Nayan Mongia, our\nwicketkeeper and stand-in opener, scoring a remarkable . It wasn\u2019t a bad start as skipper.\nUnusually, Australia had travelled all the way to India just to play a single Test, which was intended\nto mark the inauguration of the Border\u2013Gavaskar Trophy, named after two of world cricket\u2019s greatest\nicons. At least there was a good reason for that one-off game; at other times it was a little difficult to\nunderstand the thinking behind some of our shorter tours. A couple of years earlier, for example, we\nwent all the way to New Zealand for one Test match and four ODIs, with no practice games, and that\nwas considered a tour of New Zealand! We also played our fair share of two-Test series over the years\nand they are not altogether satisfactory either \u2013 you blink four times and a two-Test series is over!\nNext on the horizon was a home Test series against South Africa, which was preceded by another\none-day tournament, the Titan Cup, involving India, Australia and South Africa. It was no small\nachievement to beat Australia and South Africa, two of the best teams in the world at the time, on our\nway to the title. In the final at the Wankhede on  November, I scored  in our modest , with\n\n\fJadeja adding , and then it was all down to Anil Kumble, who took four wickets as we bowled the\nSouth Africans out for , winning the match by  runs. It was a very welcome victory after our\ndisappointing loss to Sri Lanka in the World Cup semi-final and it was particularly satisfying for me,\nbecause I had experimented with something radically different as captain.\nAfter Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad had bowled good first spells and Anil had picked up a couple of\nwickets, I had to turn to Robin Singh, our all-rounder, for the fifth bowler\u2019s quota. Robin bowled\nmedium pace and was extremely accurate. I decided to go with a four\u2013five field. In an ODI, it is very\nunusual, with a medium-pacer operating, for there to be only four fielders on the off side and five on\nthe on. I had no deep point and had fielders at third man, short point, cover and long off. On the on\nside I had fielders at fine leg, short square leg, short midwicket, deep square leg and long on. I asked\nRobin to bowl stump-to-stump and make sure not a single ball was pitched outside the off stump,\notherwise the South Africans would pick off singles to third man. Three or four singles an over would\nreally ease the pressure on them in a relatively low-scoring contest. I wasn\u2019t worried about Robin\nbowling a leg-stump wide, just as long as he didn\u2019t pitch the ball outside off stump. I was confident\nthat the South Africans were not prepared for this strategy. Robin did his job well. He bowled his full\nquota of ten overs, giving away only  runs and also picking up the important wickets of Hansie\nCronje and Daryll Cullinan.\nThe Test series that followed the Titan Cup was always going to be fiercely competitive. South\nAfrica were one of the better teams at the time and had fast bowlers of the calibre of Allan Donald and\nFanie de Villiers and batsmen of the class of Cronje, Gary Kirsten, Daryll Cullinan and Jonty Rhodes.\nThe first match of the series at Ahmedabad started on  November  and was a great contest, with\nmultiple twists and turns. After we were bowled out for a modest  in the first innings, South Africa\nmanaged a handy -run lead. It was a good lead in the context of what seemed likely to be a lowscoring game and we had to bat well in the second innings to set them a reasonable target. We faltered\nand left South Africa needing just  to win in a little under two days.\nThe game wasn\u2019t lost yet, however. There was a lot of wear and tear on the pitch by the end of the\nthird day and we knew that  might prove tricky on that surface. We were playing two leg-spinners\nin Anil Kumble and Narendra Hirwani and a left-arm spinner in Sunil Joshi. The South Africans would\nundoubtedly expect me to attack them with spinners on a crumbling pitch. Instead, I decided to use\nJavagal Srinath, because Sri, with his extra pace, could also get the ball to reverse-swing. Swing at a\ngood pace is very difficult to deal with and in no time Srinath had given us a dream start, reducing the\nSouth Africans to \u2013.\nAfter his successful short opening burst, I rested Srinath for a while before bringing him back for\nanother long spell. I kept talking to him to check if he was feeling tired. He was bowling beautifully\nand had the batsmen in all sorts of trouble. I put Sunil Joshi on at the other end to keep the batsmen in\ncheck and not concede too many runs. I asked Sunil to pitch the ball in the rough outside the lefthanders\u2019 off stump and keep them tied down to one end. This was to allow Srinath to bowl to the righthanders, as reverse swing was more effective against right-handed batsmen. This move paid real\ndividends. Sunil managed to stem the run flow while from the other end Srinath picked up wickets at\nregular intervals.\nAt no time during the chase were South Africa in with a chance. We kept up the pressure and\nmanaged to bowl them out for  in just thirty-nine overs, recording a famous victory. It was the\nhigh point of my captaincy; the plan to use Srinath from one end had worked really well. Hansie\nCronje walked up to me after the game and confessed that he had been caught off-guard. He had\nexpected me to employ spinners and had a strategy in place to negotiate the turning ball on a wearing\n\n\fpitch. He did not have a plan for Srinath, and by the time he had come to terms with our tactics the\nmatch was over.\nThe other thing I tried out in that Test match for the first time, something that served India well for\na decade and a half, was to get Rahul Dravid to bat at number three and Sourav Ganguly at five, which\nwas not an obvious decision at the time. Both had had great starts to their careers in England batting in\nother positions. Sourav had scored two consecutive hundreds batting at number three. In his third Test\nagainst Australia, which was the first of my captaincy, he once again batted in that position and scored\n in the first innings and was unbeaten on  in the second. He was full of confidence and was keen\nto continue batting at three. Rahul too had scored consecutive fifties in England in his first two Tests\nand was looking good at number five. However, I felt that by changing the batting order I could get the\nbest out of each of them in the long run.\nSourav was a boundary-hitter and liked playing his shots from the start of his innings. He was\nflamboyant and more attacking and I felt his style was more suited to number five. Rahul on the other\nhand played within himself at the start of his innings and was comfortable leaving a lot of deliveries\noutside the off stump. That\u2019s an important ability for a number-three batsman. The two had very\ndifferent strengths and I knew that both were terrific players and had the talent to serve India for many\nyears. With Rahul at three and Sourav at five, I felt the team would have a better balance, especially in\noverseas conditions. Though we reverted to Sourav at three and Rahul at five for the deciding third\nTest of this series and the first two Tests in South Africa shortly afterwards, we repeated the\nexperiment in the third and final Test of that series at Johannesburg in January . It worked very\nwell and became a permanent fixture of India\u2019s batting for over a decade.\nIn the second Test of the home series at Eden Gardens at the end of November , South Africa\nbeat us comfortably, with Lance Klusener and Gary Kirsten playing well for the visitors. Klusener\ntook eight wickets on debut and Gary scored hundreds in both innings. One of South Africa\u2019s most\nprolific opening batsmen, Gary had the remarkable ability to pick up singles at will with a nudge into\nthe gap between midwicket and square leg. This made him an extremely difficult batsman to bowl to.\nA fierce competitor, he is someone I had the highest respect for as an opponent.\nWe went to Kanpur for the third Test with the series level. Azhar was in commanding form in the\nsecond innings, remaining undefeated on , and once we had managed to set South Africa a target of\nover  we knew we were in control. We bowled South Africa out for , winning the Test by \nruns and the series \u2013. To beat Australia and South Africa in my first two series as captain was the\nbest start I could have hoped for, and when we left for South Africa in December  we were a team\nbrimming with confidence.\n\nIndia in South Africa, December \u2013February \nThe planning for the return series was not the best. We landed in South Africa on  December and\nplayed just one practice game before the first Test match in Durban on Boxing Day. On a tour like that\nyou really need at least two or three practice games and close to two weeks of acclimatization to be\ncompetitive. The conditions are so different from those in India that players have to have that time to\nget used to the seam movement and the bounce. Balls that hit the bottom half of the bat in India come\nat heights close to the bat handle in South Africa.\nWe lost the Durban Test miserably, bowled out by the South African fast bowlers for  in the\nsecond innings in just thirty-four overs. It was a demoralizing loss and I had never experienced\nanything like it before. South Africa proved superior to us in all aspects of the game and we were left\n\n\fwith a huge amount of work to do ahead of the second Test at Cape Town.\nTo add to my problems, I had injured myself in Durban while bowling and the injury was taking a\nfew days to heal. It happened when I decided to bowl to Andrew Hudson just before lunch on the first\nday. I thought I would run in slowly and bowl him an unexpected bouncer, hoping to induce a top\nedge. In doing so, I pulled a muscle in my side. The pain was surprisingly acute and I had to go to the\nhospital during the lunch break to have three cortisone injections. Even when I rejoined the team at the\nground I was still extremely sore and found it difficult to run or bend.\nThe second Test started on  January , so there were only a few days for the team to recover\nand regroup. It was never going to be enough to cope with a really good South African side. In Allan\nDonald and Shaun Pollock, the South Africans had two of the best fast bowlers in the world, and they\ncomplemented each other beautifully in home conditions. While Donald was fast, Pollock could swing\nthe ball both ways and was a master of his craft. Nevertheless, we did manage to show some signs of\ncompetitiveness in Cape Town and both Azhar and I got hundreds in the first innings.\nI went in to bat towards the end of the second day and was unbeaten on one at the end of play, with\nthe team score on \u2013. The following morning I was practising against throw-downs ahead of the\ngame and tried shuffling back and across to a few of the balls. It felt really good and I even timed the\nballs well. Something in me said that I should employ the back-and-across movement that day. I did\nso and found that, even when the bowlers were bowling at close to  kph, I still had plenty of time.\nNormally I would stand just outside my leg stump while taking guard, but at Cape Town I was\nstanding a good few inches outside to accommodate the shuffle. I ended up making . I always felt\nthat I needed to be comfortable in my head before I focused on technique. If I wasn\u2019t comfortable to\nstart with, fretting about technique would not do much for my batting.\nThe other incident I remember from the Cape Town Test and which I thoroughly enjoyed involved\nAllan Donald and the Indian medium-fast bowler Dodda Ganesh. Donald, who was in top form in that\nseries, had no patience with lower-order batsmen and was frustrated to see Ganesh hanging around. As\nDodda faced his onslaught fearlessly, Allan started mouthing words at him. For three consecutive\ndeliveries Dodda was all over the place but luckily for him did not lose his wicket. At the end of the\nover Allan went up to Dodda and told him what he thought of him in no uncertain terms. Dodda\u2019s face\nremained impassive.\nI witnessed all this from the non-striker\u2019s end. When Allan came to fetch his cap from the umpire, I\ntold him, \u2018Allan, Dodda only knows a local Indian language called Kannada. I find it difficult enough\nto communicate with him myself, so how can he understand your abuse in English? If you want to get\nto him, speak to him in Kannada.\u2019 This made Allan even more irritated. He almost snatched his cap\nfrom the umpire and, making wild gestures with his hands, stomped off to his fielding position.\nBy the end of the Cape Town match the players were much more used to the conditions and this\naugured well for us going to Johannesburg for the third Test. We were taking the game very seriously,\neven though it was a dead rubber. We played well from the start and Rahul Dravid, batting at number\nthree for the first time in the series, scored a fantastic hundred. He played the fast bowlers late and\nhelped us to a position of strength. Sourav too batted extremely well at number five and we scored \nin our first innings, which put South Africa under pressure for the first time in the series. The bowlers\nfollowed up with a good effort to give us a handy first-innings lead.\nIn our second innings it was once again Rahul and Sourav who did the business. We could sense\nvictory and were buoyed by the opportunity. Our bowlers prised out the South African top order fairly\nquickly. Even when there was a partnership between Daryll Cullinan and Lance Klusener for the\neighth wicket, we knew we were within striking distance and just needed to keep plugging away.\n\n\fWe finally got our breakthrough, in the form of Klusener, and were just two wickets away from a\nhard-earned victory when the skies opened up. It was a torrential downpour and it soon became clear\nthat we had lost a great opportunity to win a Test match in South Africa.\nI was distraught. We had done everything we could to win the match and here we were being\ndeprived by the rain. I felt cheated by the forces of nature. I went to the umpires as soon as the rain\nstopped and said we were ready to play even if the outfield was a little wet, but they were within their\nrights to say that they couldn\u2019t permit a restart unless the conditions were fit to play. The Test series\nended \u2013 in favour of South Africa, but that scoreline didn\u2019t reveal just how close we had been to\nmaking it \u2013. It left me disconsolate and in my disappointment I locked myself in the bathroom and\njust cried.\nThe other disappointment in this match was that VVS Laxman, then a youngster, fractured his\nfinger and was faced with having to go back to India. Distressed, Laxman was sitting in one corner of\nthe dressing room in tears. I tried to console him, saying that injuries happen, but that he shouldn\u2019t\nworry too much about them as he had a long career ahead of him. In hindsight it was a prophetic\nstatement!\n\nIndia in the West Indies, March\u2013April \nIndia had not won a series in the Caribbean since  and I looked on this tour as a major opportunity\nto leave the disappointment of South Africa behind. The conditions were different again from those in\nSouth Africa, and we needed to adjust quickly. However, our preparations suffered a serious jolt when\nSrinath, our leading fast bowler, was ruled out of the tour because he needed shoulder surgery. Abey\nKuruvilla, a tall fast-medium bowler from Mumbai, performed admirably as his replacement, but the\nsituation illustrates a very serious problem I faced in South Africa and subsequently in the Caribbean.\nOn tours like that, I believed we really needed three quality fast bowlers but unfortunately I never\nhad more than two. In South Africa, Abey Kuruvilla was not even part of the squad. Even when I was\ndesperate to have him, the selectors refused to include him. After making his Ranji Trophy debut in\n, Abey had played five seasons of first-class cricket by then and would have been a handy bowler\nin South Africa. As it was, after good opening spells from both Srinath and Prasad, we failed to sustain\nthe momentum. In the West Indies, we would once again rue the absence of a quality third seamer.\nDespite losing Srinath, we played well enough in the first two Tests in March , at Sabina Park\nand Port-of-Spain. Both matches ended in hard-fought draws and for once it seemed that we had\nmanaged to adjust to the conditions, with our batting looking solid against the West Indian pace\nquartet of Curtly Ambrose, Mervyn Dillon, Ian Bishop and Franklyn Rose. By the time we went to\nBarbados for the third match of the five-Test series on  March, I was feeling confident that we could\ndo something special.\nWe started well at the Kensington Oval and managed to bowl out the West Indians for under ,\nthanks to some fine bowling from Venkatesh Prasad, with \u2013, and despite a Shivnarine Chanderpaul\ncentury. As I write this, Chanderpaul has now played more than  Test matches in his career. He has\nbeen one of the most consistent middle-order batsmen for the West Indies for close to two decades,\nwhich is remarkable. We followed up the bowling with a good batting effort and managed a small\nfirst-innings lead. I scored  and was wrongly given out to an Ian Bishop delivery by umpire Lloyd\nBarker. Replays showed that Bishop had overstepped by at least four inches and it was a key moment\nin the match. As things turned out, Lloyd Barker wasn\u2019t able to officiate for much of the match after\nthat because \u2013 as I was told by the stand-in umpire who replaced him \u2013 he had had to go to hospital\n\n\fwith a serious headache and couldn\u2019t focus properly.\nIn the second innings our bowlers did well to dismiss the West Indies for  on the third day of the\nmatch. This time Abey Kuruvilla picked up \u2013 and we needed  runs to win, on a pitch that was\nincreasingly uneven, with plenty of wear and tear for the West Indian fast bowlers to exploit. We\npicked up two of those runs without loss in the few overs we had to see out at the end of Sunday\u2019s\nplay. On that track we knew that scoring would not be easy the next day, but we also felt that one good\npartnership should be enough to take us to victory.\n\nA humiliating collapse\nMonday  March  was a dark day in the history of Indian cricket and definitely the worst of my\ncaptaincy career. And yet it had promised so much. In fact, over dinner at a restaurant in St Lawrence\nGap in Barbados the night before, I remember having a joke with the waiter, who was predicting a\nWest Indian win. He was confident that Ambrose would bounce India out the next morning. Now, in\nthe first innings of this match, Franklyn Rose had bowled me a bouncer and I had pulled him into the\nstands for six. So I reminded the waiter of the shot and jokingly said to him that if Ambrose tried to\nbowl me a bouncer, I would hit him all the way to Antigua. I was so confident of our chances that I\npointed to the fridge and said he should immediately chill a bottle of champagne and I would come\nand open it the next day and pour him a glass to celebrate winning the match.\nInstead, we collapsed for a miserable  all out, handing the West Indies a -run victory. Frankly,\nthere can be no excuses for such a poor batting effort, even though it was a difficult track. I certainly\ndon\u2019t want to point fingers at anyone for the defeat, as that\u2019s not my way. In any case, I was part of\nthat team and as captain it was my responsibility to steer us to victory. I did not get the feeling that we\nwere over-confident, yet none of the batsmen apart from Laxman even reached double figures in the\nsecond innings and it was one of the worst batting displays I have been part of.\nI myself got out for just four. In my anxiety to get a feel for the ball I got a tentative edge. I should\neither have left the ball alone or tried to counter-attack. The defeat left me totally devastated and I\nshut myself in my room for two whole days trying to come to terms with the loss. I still feel the pangs\nof that defeat when I look back at the series.\n\nFrom bad to worse\nAfter eventually losing the five-Test series \u2013, we went on to lose the ODI series as well. The good\nstart to the tour had given way to a complete lack of application and that proved catastrophic in the\nend. The best example of this ineptitude was the third one-day game, at St Vincent, where we needed\n runs to win off the last ten overs with six wickets in hand. Rahul and Sourav had set up the\nplatform and we should have strolled to victory. Again and again I instructed the batsmen not to go for\nbig shots and to play along the ground, saying there was no need for any risk-taking with the asking\nrate under five runs an over. However, all our middle- and lower-order batsmen kept playing the ball\nin the air. The loss of a few wickets resulted in panic, which in turn led to a number of suicidal runouts. It was infuriating to see the team lose from a winning situation.\nAt the end of the match I called a team meeting and lost my cool with the boys in the dressing\nroom. I spoke from my heart and said the performance was unacceptable. I said that losing matches in\nwhich the opposition play better cricket is one thing \u2013 I had no problem with such defeats \u2013 but losing\na match that we had completely under control suggested there was something seriously wrong with the\n\n\fteam.\nI was extremely upset with the way we were playing and both Anil and Srinath came to my room in\nthe evening to try and calm me down. Anil said that I should not blame myself for the defeats and that\nwe would learn from the mistakes we had made in South Africa and the West Indies. However, things\nwere really starting to get on top of me. I hated losing and as captain of the team I felt responsible for\nthe string of miserable performances. More worryingly, I did not know how I could turn it around, as I\nwas already trying my absolute best.\nNot long after the series was over, I confided in Anjali that I feared there was nothing more that I\ncould do to stem the tide of defeats. Losing a string of very close matches had left me badly scarred. I\nhad given it everything and was not sure that I could give even . per cent more. The fact that we\nfailed to chase down  had nothing to do with lack of talent. It was because we batted horribly on\nthe day. It was hurting me badly and it took me a long time to come to terms with these failures. I\neven contemplated moving away from the sport completely, as it seemed nothing was going my way.\nAnjali, as usual, managed to put things in perspective and assured me that things would surely get\nbetter in the months to come. Looking back, it was just frustration getting the better of me.\n\nThe final few months\nThe string of defeats came to a temporary halt when we drew a two-Test series in Sri Lanka in August\n and then beat Pakistan \u2013 in the Sahara Cup, a one-day series in Toronto, in September. The\ntournament was memorable because Sahara had not only lent their name as sponsors but senior\nofficials like Abhijit Sarkar were personally there to ensure that everything was in order and players\nfelt comfortable. This win was all the more satisfying because we played without Srinath, Prasad and\nAnil Kumble, and we had a young bowling unit. Sourav Ganguly was the star performer for us in the\nseries, winning four Man of the Match awards on the trot.\nThere was one rather strange incident during the second match of this series involving Inzamam-ulHaq. While it appears funny in hindsight, it wasn\u2019t at the time. During one of the drinks breaks when\nwe were batting, having bowled Pakistan out for , one of the Pakistan players who wasn\u2019t playing\nin the match took out a bat for Inzamam \u2013 to the great surprise of those of us watching from the\ndressing room. We initially thought he was taking the bat out to get it autographed; only later did we\nrealize that Inzamam wanted it in order to charge at a few fans in the crowd who were taunting him\nbecause of his physique!\nWhen we came back from Toronto to Delhi, there were more than  fans to receive us at one\nthirty in the morning at Delhi airport. The police were finding it difficult to control the crowd but I\ninsisted that the team should wave to the fans before we left the airport. It was a grand homecoming.\nHowever, the satisfaction of beating Pakistan was short-lived, because within weeks we had lost a\nthree-match ODI series in Pakistan.\nIn the second game, which we won, I remember telling our off-spinner Rajesh Chauhan how to play\nSaqlain Mushtaq\u2019s doosra ball. I gave him a mini-lecture for five minutes or so and told him to give\nthe strike to Robin Singh, who was batting well at the other end. To my surprise, Rajesh ended up\nhitting a six in the last over and won us the game! However, we didn\u2019t really celebrate, as there were\narmed guards outside our hotel rooms for security reasons, something that made us uncomfortable and\nput a dampener on things. The deciding match of the series belonged to Ijaz Ahmed, who smashed our\nbowlers to all parts of the park on his way to , winning the game for Pakistan comfortably.\nWhen we got back to Delhi this time having lost the series \u2013, the fans who had queued up just\n\n\fweeks earlier were nowhere to be seen. To cap it all, I also remember that those of us who were flying\non to Mumbai were asked to pay excess baggage. I told my team-mates that we should just pay up and\nnot argue.\nThe defeat in Pakistan added to the pressure that was building on me and an incident from the home\nTest series against Sri Lanka in November\u2013December  perhaps gives an indication of how I was\nfeeling at the time. As captain, I was expected to deliver a winning performance in the three-Test\ncontest. I had not done well as a batsman in the first two Tests, both of which ended in draws. To add\nto my misery, the second Test at Nagpur was a washout. A section of the media was having a go at me\nbefore the third Test in Mumbai, which started on  December , and a lot was written about my\npoor form. It was a crunch situation and I needed to deliver both as batsman and captain.\nOn the first day I went in to bat with an hour left and was unbeaten on eight at the end of play. I had\nnot batted at my best but at least I had survived. As the overnight not-out batsman, I needed to rest but\nas has often been the case with me, I couldn\u2019t sleep. By . p.m. I had started to feel very agitated.\nTo get out of the stifling environment of the hotel, I called my friend Atul Ranade and asked him over.\nWhen he arrived I told him that I wanted to go for a drive and to visit the Shivaji Park temple.\nIt felt good praying at well past midnight. It gave me a sense of calm again and helped take my\nmind off the game. Then we went to the Siddhi Vinayak temple and finally, on our way back to the\nhotel, decided to have a milkshake at Haji Ali. Strange as it may sound, Atul and I sat on the roadside\nat  a.m. drinking milkshake and relaxing. We talked about anything but cricket and I was feeling\nmuch better when I went back to the hotel. I even managed to get some sleep and the following day I\nmade .\nUnfortunately it didn\u2019t bring the win I needed, even though at one point we were in a great position.\nAt a crucial moment in the innings we dropped a catch which would have put them under tremendous\npressure. To add to our frustration, it also started drizzling and the game was stopped. I felt it was a\ncombination of missed chances and bad luck that cost us the match.\nThe Sri Lanka series was followed by a four-nation tournament in Sharjah in December . We\nplayed some very poor cricket against England, Pakistan and the West Indies, losing all our matches\nand failing to make the final. The match against Pakistan on  December highlights how things were\njust not going my way. I was batting at number four in this competition, at the selectors\u2019 request.\nSourav and Navjot Sidhu had given us a good start against Pakistan, and when Sidhu got out at \u2013,\nI sent in Robin Singh, the all-rounder, to accelerate the innings. It was a strategy I had given\nconsiderable thought to. Manzoor Akhtar, the leg-spinner, was at one end bowling around the wicket\nto the right-handed batsmen. The theory was that Robin, a left-hander, would be able to negotiate his\nleg-spin better and also hit some big shots. However, Robin got out without scoring after just three\nballs from Azhar Mahmood, the medium-pacer, and the experiment proved a disaster.\nIn the press I was criticized for sending in Robin ahead of me and the move was blamed for our\ndefeat. A month later, however, in January , Azhar, back as captain, repeated the very same move\nin the final of the Silver Jubilee Independence Cup in Dhaka against Pakistan. Robin was sent in at\nthree to keep up the momentum after Sourav and I had got off to a flier and this time Robin played a\nterrific hand, scoring  and setting up the run chase. This was arguably a bigger gamble, because he\nwas pitted against the off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq and it is no secret that left-handers find it more\ndifficult against off-spinners. The same experiment was now hailed as a master stroke. Not without\nreason is it said that success has many fathers while defeat is an orphan.\nThe Sharjah losses were followed by a three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka at home. After\nwe\u2019d taken a \u2013 lead in the series, the second match was a washout and Sri Lanka played well to beat\n\n\fus in the third game in Goa. At the end of the series I was unceremoniously sacked as skipper. No one\nfrom the BCCI managed to call me or inform me of my removal as captain before someone from the\nmedia called to say I was no longer captain. I was actually with my friends in Sahitya Sahawas. I felt\nextremely humiliated to hear this, but the manner in which the whole thing was handled strengthened\nmy resolve to be a better cricketer in the years to come. I told myself that the BCCI mandarins might\nbe able to take the captaincy away from me, but no one could do the same as far as my own cricket\nwas concerned. The sense of ignominy and the pain were still there, however. During my tenure as\ncaptain some of the players used to call me \u2018skip\u2019, so when one of the players shouted out \u2018skipper\u2019 in\nour next engagement in Dhaka, I automatically turned around to answer the call. That\u2019s when it really\nhit me that I was no longer the captain of the Indian cricket team. Now I simply had to focus on my\nbatting and win some matches for the team. So that\u2019s what I did. In fact, not long after this, I was so\nfocused on doing well that I ended up shouting at someone who has since become a good friend. This\nincident, which has caused us both much embarrassment, took place in the second of the three finals\nof the Silver Jubilee Independence Cup in Dhaka in . There was a lot of movement in front of and\naround the sightscreen and, despite my repeated complaints, things did not improve. I was distracted\nand lost my wicket soon after. On my way back to the pavilion I was livid and, when someone came\nacross to apologize, I just screamed at him, saying Bangladesh did not deserve to host international\ncricket if the basic fundamentals were not in place. Only later did I realize that the man I had yelled at\nwas Ashraful Haq, then president of the Bangladesh Cricket Board and currently chief executive of the\nAsian Cricket Council. Ever since, whenever we meet, we start by saying sorry to each other for what\nhappened!\nAustralia in India  \u2013 The Border-Gavaskar Trophy\nOne-off Test.

It generated a lot of hype and much of it was being built up as a contest between myself and\nShane Warne. It\u2019s inevitable that there are times when battles between two individuals hog most of the\nlimelight. For example, Brian Lara versus Glenn McGrath, Ricky Ponting versus Courtney Walsh, or\neven Tendulkar versus Lara, as had been the case in . I always said that this series was a contest\nbetween two teams and not two individuals, though in my heart of hearts I knew it was a very\nimportant match-up against Warne. Shane was bowling beautifully and had just had a great series\nagainst South Africa in Australia, taking twenty wickets in three Tests.\nKnowing that I would soon be facing him, I studied Warne\u2019s bowling in that series carefully. It\nappeared to me that his biggest strength was the drift he managed to get, which meant that the\nbatsman was somewhat blinded by the delivery if he was batting with a traditional side-on stance.\nBecause of the extra drift, the ball would tend to go away from the vision of the batsman and it\nbecame that much more difficult to negotiate the extra spin. As a result, I decided to open up my\nstance a little to Warne and to stand slightly outside the leg stump. I also planned to play him more\nfrom the crease and as late as possible. I hardly stepped out to him all series and, more often than not,\nkept hitting him towards midwicket with a horizontal bat whenever he tried to extract extra spin from\nleg stump or slightly outside. By playing from the crease and by using the horizontal bat, I reckoned I\nhad opened up the option of punishing him if he bowled short and could also play the cut shot on the\noff side. While there was always the risk of a top edge, I was prepared to accept it to surprise Warne.\nAfter all, he was Australia\u2019s most potent weapon and I had to have a strategy against him.\nHaving worked on the theory, I now needed to practise against the kind of deliveries Warne would\nuse when under pressure. I started training in late January, with still a month to go before the series,\nand asked for the best spinners available in Mumbai to bowl at me from round the wicket into the\nrough outside leg stump. I was certain that\u2019s what Warne would do if I succeeded in attacking him\nwhen he bowled from over the wicket. All that practice in Mumbai against Sairaj Bahutule and Nilesh\nKulkarni, both of whom played for India against Australia in , and subsequently in Chennai\nagainst Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, now a respected television commentator who played for India in\nthe mid-s, proved immensely useful, and by the time the Australians arrived in India in February\n I felt ready to face Warne.\n\nAn early skirmish\nThe first game the Australians played was against Mumbai on  February. I was captaining Mumbai\nand knew it was crucial to establish a psychological advantage over the visitors at the start of the tour.\nThe most important thing was to attack Warne. I had instructed all our batsmen to take Warne on\n\n\fwhenever he came on to bowl. I did not care if we lost wickets, but there was no way we would allow\nWarne to settle into his groove and dictate terms.\nWhen it was our turn to bat, Amit Pagnis, opening the batting for Mumbai, did exactly what we had\nplanned. Though we lost an early wicket in Sulakshan Kulkarni, Pagnis and I attacked Warne from the\nstart. While Pagnis hit Warne for four boundaries in two overs, I hit him for a six in his very first over\nand continued to attack him right through the innings. His sixteen overs cost him  runs and that\nwas far more important than my own double hundred off  balls \u2013 though I was particularly pleased\nwith my effort because I had made a conscious attempt to dominate the bowling and it was my first\ndouble in first-class cricket. Having conceded a lead of more than  in the first innings, the\nAustralians collapsed to  all out in their second innings, with Nilesh Kulkarni, who had first played\nfor India in , running through half the side. We finished the match without losing a wicket in our\nsecond innings, handing the Australians a ten-wicket defeat.\nA crushing loss in the first tour game was the worst possible start for the world\u2019s best team and was\nmore than we could have hoped for. We now needed to carry the momentum forward into the first Test\nmatch in Chennai. Of course, I was well aware that the Australians had not played all their cards\nagainst Mumbai. Even when we were attacking Shane Warne, not once did he bowl from round the\nwicket into the rough outside leg stump. I was certain he would do so at the first available opportunity\nin Chennai, and I even said as much in the post-match press conference in Mumbai. The series was\nnicely set up.\n\nFirst Test, Chennai, \u2013 March \nHaving played a lot of cricket in Chennai, I knew that the physical preparation in the lead-up to a\nChennai Test has to be different from normal. You have to prepare your body for the heat and\nhumidity well in advance and I always did so at least thirty-six hours before the match by drinking a\nlot more water than normal. The extra water intake was particularly important, because you lose so\nmuch fluid during matches at the Chidambaram Stadium.\nNowadays, unlike in the late s and s, when there wasn\u2019t much research about players\u2019\ndiets and training schedules, cricket is much more sophisticated about such matters. There are\nspecialized dieticians who draw up charts of what players can or can\u2019t eat. After long and arduous\nbatting stints, players take ice baths and drink specially prepared shakes to rehydrate the body and\nreplace lost energy. For example, I remember Paddy Upton, our high-performance trainer, asking me\nto drink two glasses of a shake made of crushed dry fruits after a particularly draining innings at\nGwalior in .\nAt Chennai, we won the toss and opted to bat first. It was an important toss to win, as the ball was\nexpected to turn in the fourth innings and we were playing three spinners in Anil Kumble, Rajesh\nChauhan and Venkatapathy Raju. Despite a good start, with the top three of Mongia, Sidhu and Dravid\nall scoring fifties, we lost our way in the middle of the first innings and failed to push home the\nadvantage, getting bowled out for a modest . Batting at number four, I managed just four runs and\nfell to Warne. I hit him for a boundary and then tried to repeat the shot, only to get an outside edge to\nMark Taylor at slip. I was extremely disappointed with myself for not playing myself in and was\ndetermined to make amends in the second innings.\nOur bowlers, in particular Kumble and Raju, did well to get the first eight Australian wickets for\n. It seemed we had a good chance of taking a first-innings lead, but we were frustrated when the\nAustralian wicketkeeper Ian Healy and off-spinner Gavin Robertson, the debutant, put together a very\n\n\fgood partnership. They added  runs between them, and Australia eventually gained a -run\nadvantage. It seemed a crucial lead and at a dinner organized by former BCCI president AC Muthiah,\nSrinivas Venkataraghavan, a former India captain and leading off-spinner of the s, said to me that\nit would be very difficult for us to get back into the match. He said that he thought there wasn\u2019t\nenough time left in the game to make up the deficit, set a target and finally bowl Australia out to win\nthe match. I replied confidently that there was still plenty of time and that I was sure we would be able\nto turn things round.\nBefore the start of our second innings I remember saying in the dressing room that it was the\nresponsibility of the batsmen to put their hands up and try to score  runs each for the team. You\ndon\u2019t always need to set the bar really high and demand a hundred. I thought that scoring  in the\nsecond innings at Chennai would be good enough to set up the match.\nWhen Sidhu was out for an important , I walked out to bat at \u2013, in effect \u2013 after\ndeducting the deficit of  runs, and as on many occasions in my career I had Rahul Dravid for\ncompany in the middle. I started out watchfully and was soon into my groove. As expected, Shane\nWarne started to bowl round the wicket and I instantly took the attack to him and hit him over\nmidwicket. From an individual perspective it was a defining moment in the game. We couldn\u2019t afford\nto lose another wicket, but we also couldn\u2019t go too much on the defensive.\nRahul and I added more than a hundred runs, to set up a strong platform. By the time Rahul was\ndismissed for another well-played half-century, I felt in control. I went on the attack and scored at a\nfair clip, hitting fours and sixes with regularity. Azhar gave me good support and we also added over a\nhundred runs, at almost five runs an over, a potentially match-winning partnership.\nWhen we declared, I was not out on , the first-innings lead had been nullified and we were in\nwith a great chance of winning the match, having set the Australians a target of  on a turning track.\nIt was certainly one of my better hundreds and what made the sensation sweeter was that we\nproceeded to bowl the Australians out for , with Kumble taking four wickets, and we won the\nmatch by  runs. It was a tremendous start and, to add to my delight, I was Man of the Match. I had\nmade up for getting out to Warne cheaply in the first innings of the match.\nImportantly, we had performed as a unit and most of the senior members had played their parts to\nperfection. Anil had taken eight wickets in the game while Navjot Sidhu, opening the batting, had\ndone a good job in both innings. He had attacked Warne from the start of our second innings and had\nset the game up for the other batsmen. Rahul too batted well in each innings and pocketed a couple of\nimportant catches at slip. We had shown good fighting spirit and that, more than anything, augured\nwell for the team for the second Test match at Eden Gardens in Kolkata later that month.\n\nSecond Test, Kolkata, \u2013 March \nIf Chennai was a rollercoaster, we were in control in Kolkata from the start. Australia won the toss at\nEden Gardens but failed to press home an early advantage, losing four top-order wickets within the\nfirst hour of play. Srinath bowled a fine opening spell to take three wickets and Sourav too chipped in\nwith the wicket of Mark Taylor. Despite a brief period of Australian resurgence under Steve Waugh\nand Ricky Ponting, we kept our nerve and bowled them out for  in the first innings.\nOur batsmen followed up with some big runs and for a rare occasion in Test cricket all first five\nbatsmen passed , with Azhar going on to score a hundred at his favourite venue. I scored  and\nonce again took the attack to Shane Warne, who went wicketless in his forty-two overs, conceding \nruns. The plan against Warne was working and without his wickets the Australians were in trouble. I\n\n\fremember one particular shot against Warne on day two. In my determination to attack him, I hadn\u2019t\nnoticed that it was the last over before tea and I hit him for a big six over long on, which I normally\nwouldn\u2019t have risked so close to a break. It just goes to show how hard you had to concentrate to cope\nwith Warne.\nWe knew, of course, that the Australians were all excellent players, despite being at the receiving\nend for the time being, and we knew that it was important to keep them under pressure throughout the\nmatch. A champion team needs only a small window of opportunity to stage a fightback, something I\nhad learnt over the years. If the Australians were on the back foot, you couldn\u2019t allow them the whiff\nof an opportunity to stage a recovery. We needed to be ruthless and we were. Having scored  in our\nfirst innings, we let Kumble and Srinath do the rest on a track that was offering variable bounce.\nAustralia collapsed for  in their second innings, giving us one of our biggest Test wins. More\nimportantly, we were \u2013 up in the three-Test series against the best team in the world and were justly\nproud of the achievement.\n\nThird Test, Bangalore, \u2013 March \nIn the final match of the series our team included a teenaged debutant in off-spinner Harbhajan Singh.\nI scored a big hundred in the first innings and once again we managed to put the Australian bowlers\nunder pressure. Though Warne picked up three wickets, he also went for a lot of runs. To his credit, he\nwas always in the game, despite being attacked. In fact, as I played out the last over of the first day\nagainst him, I had to keep telling myself to concentrate till the very last ball was bowled. A true great,\nWarne would not let you relax for a single delivery.\nMark Waugh batted brilliantly in the Australian first innings, scoring an unbeaten , and Michael\nKasprowicz, the fast bowler, picked up a five-wicket haul in our second innings to set up the match. I\nwas caught and bowled by Kasprowicz for , playing a ball early, and we collapsed for a paltry .\nThere was no doubt about it: Australia had played better than us in Bangalore and had shown what\nthey were made of. For our part, we were disappointed at not closing out the series on a winning note.\nIt was one of the most intense series I played in my career, and one of the most personally\nsuccessful. I had scored close to  runs at an average of . Weeks of rigorous practice had paid\noff and it was a deeply satisfying feeling.\n\nPepsi triangular series, April \nThe Test series was followed by a one-day tri-series, with Zimbabwe as the third team. Our first match\nwas against Australia at Kochi on  April, and it remains a match I have extremely fond memories of.\nI was opening the batting again in one-day cricket by this stage but unfortunately got out early.\nLuckily it did not matter, with Ajay Jadeja batting well in the middle order for a hundred and taking us\npast .\nAustralia got off to a flier. Adam Gilchrist, the best wicketkeeper-batsman of our generation, went\nafter the bowling and they cruised to  in just twelve overs. It was apparent that if they played out\nthe full fifty overs they\u2019d win the game. Midway through the innings, I was brought on to bowl and I\nstarted bowling off-spin to the left-handers and leg-spin to the right-handers.\nIt\u2019s one of those strange things, but for some reason sometimes a batsman just does not like the\nsight of a particular bowler. In my case, I was never comfortable facing Hansie Cronje, who got me\nout on a number of occasions with his medium pace. Even when I was in control against the likes of\n\n\fAllan Donald, Hansie would somehow get the better of me and I\u2019d get out to him in the most\nunexpected ways. So you don\u2019t always need to be a front-line bowler to trouble a particular batsman \u2013\nand that\u2019s what happened between me and Steve Waugh. Throughout my career I had a feeling Steve\nwasn\u2019t comfortable against my leg-spin. At Kochi, I bowled a perfect leg-spinner to him and he\nlobbed the ball straight back to me.\nI was elated at the dismissal and it was a big moment in the game. It was the opening we needed to\nput the pressure back on the Australians. The other big wicket that gave me a lot of satisfaction was\nthat of Michael Bevan, a very effective batsman in limited-overs cricket, who was constantly trying to\ncome down the wicket to negate the turn. I had warned Nayan Mongia, our wicketkeeper, that I\u2019d bowl\na quick one down the leg side if I saw Bevan try that against me. The ploy worked and Bevan was\nstumped off a wide ball down the leg side.\nThis was one of those rare matches when every ball was coming out of the hand perfectly, and I\neven had a fielder at slip past the thirty-over mark. The odd thing is that over the course of my career I\nfound that whenever I practised hard at bowling leg-spin, I could never land the ball properly. And yet\nsometimes when I hadn\u2019t practised for months it just landed on the spot at crucial times in a match. In\nthe end I decided to bowl leg-spin in the nets as and when I felt like it, without thinking too much\nabout the technical aspects. In any case, Anil Kumble once explained to me that to bowl leg-spin\nconsistently, I needed to hold my shoulder while bowling. What he meant was that I needed to have\nmy fingers, arm and shoulder position aligned for longer. It was something I could never get the hang\nof, so I just left it to my natural ability, and I rarely bowled more than three overs at a stretch in a\nmatch unless I was bowling really well. This gave me licence to experiment and I could give the ball a\nrip if I wished to. At Kochi it all worked beautifully. I finished with \u2013 and Australia were bowled\nout for  in the forty-sixth over. We had won the match by  runs.\nWe continued the good form against the Australians in the next ODI at the Green Park stadium in\nKanpur on  April. It was a low-scoring encounter, with the Australians setting us  to chase. The\npitch was keeping low and I had figured out that the best option was to be aggressive at the start. I got\nanother hundred in this match and remember one particular shot against Tom Moody. Even before he\nhad released the ball, I stepped out and he followed me. The ball was down the leg side and, having\nstepped out of my crease, I wasn\u2019t in the best position to meet the delivery. I connected on the full but\nplayed it slightly off-balance. To my surprise, the ball landed in the stands, way beyond the boundary.\nLater in the innings I came down the wicket to Warne and this time the ball hit the bottom of my bat.\nWarne immediately screamed \u2018Catch it!\u2019 \u2013 only to see the ball soar over the long-on fielder and land\n yards behind him for another six. I hit seven in all and we won the game comfortably, to book a\nspot in the final, which we unfortunately lost to Australia. It was disappointing after winning all the\ngroup matches and it resulted in an imperfect end to the tour.\n\nCoca-Cola Cup, April \nSoon after the series was over we went to Sharjah for yet another tri-series, with Australia and New\nZealand. It is a tournament I remember well because I played some of my best cricket and because of\nan incident that took place on the flight out to Sharjah. The Indian team included two relative\nnewcomers, Harbhajan Singh and Harvinder Singh, the medium-fast bowler. The flight attendant\nasked both of them if they wanted soup. Not very good with English at the time, Harvinder may not\nhave understood the question. I overheard Harvinder tell Bhajji that it was prudent just to take what\nwas being served. Then Harvinder, trying to figure out what to add to his soup, ended up adding sugar-\n\n\ffree sweetener instead of salt. Bhaji, who always enjoyed a laugh, was aware of what Harvinder had\ndone and kept asking him if he was enjoying his food! Harvinder was too embarrassed to admit his\nmistake and so he pretended to like it.\nSharjah, in April, was hot, very hot. The heat was oppressive and it was a real test of stamina. I\ncould feel the heat through my shoes and it often caused a burning sensation, which was extremely\ndiscomforting. It was physically draining to bat for long hours and, with little recovery time between\ngames, it was a stern test of a player\u2019s skill, both physical and mental.\nThe two matches everyone remembers were both against Australia, on  and  April . The\nfirst one was our last round-robin game, which we needed to win, or score a certain number of runs in,\nto qualify for the final. Australia had already made it to the final by winning all three of their pool\ngames.\nIn the first of the two games, Australia batted first and scored a very healthy , with  from\nMark Waugh and a century from Bevan. We needed a good start to get our chase on track.\nUnfortunately, however, we had lost four wickets for just  runs in twenty-nine overs when the\nmatch was interrupted. I had never seen a sandstorm in my life. Waves of sand were blowing from one\nend of the ground to the other and the wind was so strong that I feared my five-foot-five-inch frame\nwould get blown away. The wind was also causing a strange sound and we could only see a few metres\nahead of us. Players and umpires were understandably worried about getting sand in their eyes and\ninstinctively dropped to the ground. I quickly went and lay down behind Adam Gilchrist, who I\nreckoned was strong enough to withstand the force of the wind. My plan was simple \u2013 if the wind ever\ngot too strong, I would hold on to Gilchrist for support. While it appears funny in hindsight to have\nused an Australian wicketkeeper as a shield, the whole experience was rather strange to start with.\nBecause the match was interrupted for more than forty-five minutes, it was reduced to forty-six\novers a side but the target was cut by only eight runs. To win the match, we now needed  off\nseventeen overs, which may appear eminently gettable in this age of Twenty cricket but was a really\nsteep target in . A deduction of eight runs for the loss of four overs didn\u2019t make sense to us, and\nwe knew we were up against it. Effectively the target to win had become stiffer. On the other hand, to\nqualify, we only needed  runs.\nAnshuman Gaekwad, a former India opening batsman and then our coach, was in charge of the\ncalculations and I asked him the exact target before I went out to resume the innings. Several of my\nteam-mates thought we should just concentrate on getting the  runs we needed for qualification\nand not risk our place in the final by going for the win. However, I was determined to win the match\nand go to the finals, because I was timing the ball well and felt good about my batting. And beating\nAustralia would give us an edge over them in the final.\nIt was important not to let the Australian bowlers settle. I hit Tom Moody for a six as soon as the\ngame resumed, making my intentions clear. I followed it up with another six off Warne and attacked\nthe Australians in every over I faced. They were doing their best to keep me off strike, while my\npartner VVS Laxman was doing his best to make sure I faced the bulk of the bowling. Looking back, I\nfeel I owe him an apology as at one point I lost my temper with him when he refused a second run,\nthinking I was in danger of getting run out. I just wanted to play every ball I could.\nWhen we passed  I started to feel that the Australian score was within reach. I was determined to\nbat on and finish the game. I have to say that if I had not got out to a dubious decision by the umpire\nwith three overs still left in the game, I think we would probably have chased down the Australian\nscore. I was given out to Damien Fleming, caught by Gilchrist for , when the ball seemed to me to\nbe above shoulder height and should have been declared a no-ball. But such things happen in cricket\n\n\fand in the end we lost the game but qualified for the final and still had a chance for revenge.\nThinking of this match reminds me of a story about Anshuman Gaekwad. I have very fond\nmemories of Anshu bhai as our coach and he undoubtedly had a very positive influence and helped me\nin a number of ways, but I can also never forget his amazing capacity to eat the hottest of hot food. On\none occasion in New Zealand in  he asked the hotel chef to make a paste of green chillies for him.\nThe chef took on the challenge and returned later with a fresh bowl of chilli paste, warning him that he\nshould be careful only to have a little because it was extremely hot. To the chef\u2019s amazement, Anshu\nbhai gratefully took the bowl from him and polished off the lot without breaking sweat \u2013 and even\nasked for some more! Frankly, no one else could have eaten even half a spoonful.\n\nA final to remember\nWhen we returned to the hotel after the last pool game, I was very tired and yet I just couldn\u2019t get to\nsleep. I eventually dropped off well after  a.m. With just a day before the final, this didn\u2019t bode well.\nIn the extreme heat I had lost a lot of fluid and I needed time to get myself rehydrated and allow my\nbody and mind to recover.\nWhen I got up in the morning my body was stiff. My back was tight and I was even finding it\ndifficult to walk to the bathroom. The stiffness was partly a result of the dehydration and the first\nthing I did was drink a lot of water. There have been a few occasions in my career when I have had\ndifficulties standing up straight in the mornings. Sometimes I have really had to push myself to get off\nthe bed and in extreme situations the physio and the masseur have had to give me a helping hand. Of\ncourse, I didn\u2019t mind the stiffness so much if I had scored a hundred or played a match-winning knock\nthe day before. In that case, it was a happy feeling and a reminder of the effort I had put in! However,\nif the stiffness was caused by fielding for two long days, I would resent it immensely. So at Sharjah I\nhad no reason to complain about the pain \u2013 it was a very small price to pay.\nAt lunchtime, I met Mark Mascarenhas for a meal at his hotel. Ravi Shastri, Shane Warne and\nRichie Benaud, former Australian captain and one of the greatest cricketers to have played the game,\nwere also present and I had a brief non-cricketing chat with them all before returning to the hotel. I\nwasn\u2019t particularly concerned about the physical aspect of the recovery, as I was confident of digging\ninto my reserves. I was more concerned with the mental recovery after such a high-intensity\nencounter.\nIn the evening, I had an interesting conversation with Mark. It was the Coca-Cola Cup and I was\ninformed that, as sponsors, Coca-Cola wanted to announce a reward for me for the innings I had\nplayed the night before. They wanted to give me \u00a3,, which was a substantial sum of money.\nWhen Mark asked me what I\u2019d do with it, I said that I would share it with my team-mates. It was our\npractice to share rewards among all players and I\u2019d do no different. After that the issue wasn\u2019t raised\nagain and I had put it out of my mind by the time I went to bed.\nIn the final, Australia batted first and put  runs on the board. It was a very good score,\nconsidering it was the final. We couldn\u2019t afford to lose an early wicket and I knew I had to stay in to\nset up the game. People were expecting me to blast the Australian attack from ball one, but that was an\nimpossible proposition. Perhaps in people\u2019s minds I could just pick up from where I had left off two\nnights before. The reality, of course, was different. It was a new match and I was starting a new\ninnings. I had to play myself in all over again and it wasn\u2019t going to be easy.\nTo make matters more difficult, the Australians bowled a good line and I had to work very hard not\nto get out. In the first over I faced against Damien Fleming, I played five dot-balls and was trying to\n\n\fleave the sixth ball, which hit my inside edge and went for a streaky boundary, missing the stumps by\ntwo inches. It was a lucky escape and I told myself that I was obviously still fatigued and wasn\u2019t\nmoving my feet properly. I would have to spend time in the middle for my body to get used to the\nconditions and for my timing to come back.\nWe managed to score just  in the first five overs and the Australians continued to apply pressure\nby bowling a very tight line around the off stump. There were no loose balls on offer and I wasn\u2019t\nhappy. The pressure was mounting and it was time to try something different. I was forced to take a\nrisk to push the run rate up and so I came down the wicket to Michael Kasprowicz in the sixth over of\nour innings. I managed to connect well and the ball soared over the boundary. The crowd was in\nraptures and the bowler was taken by surprise. I now anticipated that he\u2019d bowl me a bouncer the very\nnext ball. It is a fast bowler\u2019s natural response and I was more than prepared for it. I stayed back in the\ncrease and easily hit the short ball for another six. It definitely rattled Kasprowicz and the Australians.\nThe risks I had taken had paid off and the touch had come back. There was no need for any further\nrisk-taking and the run chase was back on track.\nWith Nayan Mongia, who had been promoted up the order, and Azhar giving me good support, I\nwas able to pace my innings without allowing the Australian bowlers to dominate and gradually the\nmatch was turning our way. Shane Warne tried coming round the wicket and yet again I countered him\nby hitting him over midwicket and square leg. With Warne ineffective \u2013 he conceded more than six\nruns an over in his spell \u2013 the Australians were forced to turn to Tom Moody. We attacked him\nthroughout his spell and also put pressure on Australia\u2019s irregular bowlers, Mark and Steve Waugh.\nBy the time I finally got out for , the result was a mere formality. We needed just  from six\novers. As I was walking back to the pavilion I could see Mark Mascarenhas waiting for me next to the\nsightscreen. I was soaked in sweat and, seeing Mark was about to give me a hug, I remember warning\nhim that he would spoil his smart clothes. Mark wasn\u2019t bothered and he lifted me up into the air with a\nsmile.\nThe post-match presentation turned out to be really special. Steve Waugh said that they had lost to\nme, which was quite something coming from the Australian captain on a day which also happened to\nbe my twenty-fifth birthday. There could have been no better birthday present.\nDuring the presentation an announcement was made by Coca-Cola that they had decided to give me\na Mercedes SL. I have always been interested in cars and remembered my first introduction to a\nvariety of fancy cars such as BMWs on my first trip to England with the Star Cricket Club in .\n\nGood to be back\nOn our return to Mumbai we were greeted by a sea of humanity and it was touching to see fans\nshowering such warmth on the players. In the ultimate analysis, we play for our fans and to be able to\nmake them happy has always been extremely important.\nSometimes things can get a little out of hand, however. After coming back from Sharjah I was\ninvited to a double-wicket tournament at the Shivaji Park Gymkhana in Mumbai. Pravin Amre called\nme and said the organizers were keen for me to go along to encourage the players. Shivaji Park has\nalways been special to me and I decided to take Anjali with me. When we arrived we found that a huge\ncrowd had assembled to see me. My visit had caused a law-and-order situation and in the end it was\ndifficult to get away from the chaos. We somehow managed to leave Shivaji Park Gymkhana for home\nand I felt humbled at the affection I had received. Fans asking for autographs always made me feel\nspecial and I make it a point to oblige them whenever I can. The people who wait for hours are the\n\n\fones who make the game what it is in India and we are lucky that we have such a passionate fanbase\nfor the sport in the country.\nLooking back at the four months between January and April , I feel a sense of deep\nsatisfaction. I had led the charge against the Australians and had enjoyed the personal contest against\nShane Warne. But it didn\u2019t stop there. I went on to bat at close to my best throughout  and in\nNovember played my part in winning us the Champions Trophy tri-series at Sharjah against Sri Lanka\nand Zimbabwe.\nWhat I remember about that competition is that the Zimbabwe fast bowler Henry Olonga had taken\nme by surprise in the last match of the group stage with a short ball and the manner of my dismissal\nhad kept me restless right up to the final. So much so that I decided I had to settle the scores. It was\nlike in boxing \u2013 either you go down or I go down. In the final I managed to score  off ninety-two\nballs, but I must confess that some of my shots were not what you might call orthodox cricketing\nshots, as all I was doing was smashing the ball. That\u2019s what happens when you are batting well \u2013 even\nslogs go for boundaries \u2013 whereas during a lean patch, you get out to bad balls.\n\nInvitations I couldn\u2019t turn down\nA few months before that Champions Trophy, in July and August , two things happened that I\nwill never forget. The first was that I was invited to play in the Princess Diana Memorial Match at\nLord\u2019s on  July. The opposition bowling line-up included Glenn McGrath, Javagal Srinath, Allan\nDonald and Anil Kumble, and I managed to score  against them while opening the batting. Though\nI didn\u2019t manage to make a hundred at Lord\u2019s in Test cricket, this was a ton I have fond memories of,\nespecially because it came against a top-quality bowling attack.\nThe second memorable thing happened in August when Shane Warne and I had the great honour of\nbeing invited to visit Sir Don Bradman at his house in Adelaide on the occasion of his ninetieth\nbirthday. We were both very nervous about meeting the great man and I remember debating with\nShane in the taxi on the way about who should talk to him first. I said that it should be Shane, because\nhe\u2019s a fellow Australian; he said that it should be me, because I\u2019m a fellow batsman. In the end, Sir\nDon, who fondly referred to me as \u2018Bonzer\u2019, took control of proceedings as soon as we arrived and\nquickly made us feel at ease.\nOne of the things I remember asking him was how he thought he would have coped in the\ncontemporary game. He said that he didn\u2019t think he would have scored quite so many runs because of\nthe more defensive field settings that are used nowadays; when he was playing, the fields weren\u2019t\nchanged much, even if a batsman was scoring a lot of runs, and fielding positions like deep point\nweren\u2019t in vogue back in the s. He also said that the standard of fielding was much better in the\ncontemporary game.\nFinally, we asked what he thought his Test average would be if he played today. \u2018Around ,\u2019 he\nsaid. We were slightly surprised and asked if he was sure it would be so much lower than his famous\ncareer average of .. He said, \u2018Well,  isn\u2019t bad for a ninety-year-old!\u2019\nAll in all,  was a special year in my career.\nAustralia in India  \u2013 The Border\u2013Gavaskar Trophy\nst Test.

    "1999-2003": " TUMULTUOUS TIMES\n\nWhile I was starting to play some of the best cricket of my career, at home my life had undergone a\nfundamental transformation. That is because on  October  I had received my greatest ever gift,\nwith Anjali giving birth to our first child. I had shared the news that I was expecting a child with my\nteam-mates when we were touring Zimbabwe in February  and organized an impromptu party in\ncelebration. I was thrilled at the thought of becoming a father.\nThe night before the moment finally arrived I was with my friend Sunil Harshe on the terrace of\nAnjali\u2019s family\u2019s house in Breach Candy. The house was just two minutes away from the hospital and\nI had been told by Anjali\u2019s paediatrician friend, Dr Ajit Gajendragadkar, that he would call me the\nmoment they brought her out of the delivery room. My prolonged presence in the hospital would have\ncaused difficulties for the authorities and it was best that I waited for the call. Restless and anxious, I\nwas lying on the terrace, staring up at the sky, and I remember saying to Sunil that within hours I\nwould be a father and turn a new page in my life. All I was praying for was that Anjali and the child\nwould both be safe and healthy.\nWhen Dr Gajendragadkar finally called me with the good news the following day, I arrived at the\nhospital within minutes with a video camera in my hand. Seconds after reaching the maternity ward, I\nsaw the doctor carrying my child in his arms and that\u2019s when I was told that God had blessed us with a\nbaby girl. I recorded the whole thing and cherish the recording of the doctor bringing my daughter out\nto me. It\u2019s impossible to describe the overwhelming sensation of seeing my child for the first time. I\nwent up to Anjali and said to her that we would call our daughter Sara. In fact, it was a name that Ajit\nhad suggested and both Anjali and I loved it. When the doctor asked me to hold Sara, I was much too\nnervous to do so at first, though I was longing to take her in my arms. I had never held a newborn in\nmy life.\nOn the day of Sara\u2019s birth, I asked permission from the hospital authorities to stay with Anjali in\nher room. I simply did not want to leave my wife and daughter alone. While I knew that they were in\ngood hands, I wanted to be with them the whole time. They were only too kind and suggested that,\nwhile there wasn\u2019t an extra bed for me, I could stay in the same room as Anjali and they were happy to\nprovide a mattress, which was placed on the floor. That was fine with me and I will always appreciate\ntheir help.\nSara, according to everyone who saw her, was a carbon copy of me and I loved the act of putting her\nto sleep in my arms. I would just rock her for a couple of minutes and she would go off to sleep. I had\na beard then and once she was a few months old I would place her on my lap and brush her hair with it.\nIt was a favourite father\u2013daughter pastime and something both of us loved to do every day.\nWith a packed cricket calendar, which entailed me being away from home for long periods, it could\nnot have been easy for Anjali to bring up young Sara alone, but not once did she appear to resent this\nor ask me to spend more time at home. For my part, I know I found it difficult to leave my newborn\n\n\fdaughter. Every time I came back after a tour I could spot the changes in her and I was aware that I\nwas missing out on something truly special.\nThe first international destination that young Sara travelled to was New Zealand in December .\nWe arrived in Napier to start with and the team were given comfortable serviced apartments to stay in.\nI was given a two-bedroom apartment and it was decided that Anjali and Sara would sleep in one\nbedroom while I used the other. Sara, who had just turned one, had serious trouble adjusting to the\ntime difference. She would be awake all night and would expect Anjali to play with her the whole\ntime. I would put her to sleep all right, but then she would wake up an hour later and start wandering\nall over the apartment. Because I had to train or play a match the next day, there was no way I could\nstay up with her. As a result the responsibility fell on Anjali.\nAt one stage we were both finding it extremely tough to adjust and Anjali suggested that she would\nmuch rather return to India. It was difficult managing a toddler alone, having to cook, clean and wash\nher clothes, and when it was time to sleep she would be wide awake and ready to play. But then we\ntook her to the park to feed the ducks in the pond, which she loved, and that gave us so much joy that\nthe thought of going back was buried.\nThere is another story about Sara in New Zealand that I will never forget. The door to my bedroom\nwas always kept open so that Sara could come and go whenever she wanted. One morning Bhajji said\nto me that I ought to check if she had something in her mouth. I was surprised, because we had not\ngiven her anything. I had to persuade Sara to open her mouth for me and when she did I was shocked\nto see that she had four or five cherry stones in her mouth. She must have had them in there for at least\na few minutes, and had it not been for Bhajji there could have been a serious problem.\nThe team spent Christmas and New Year in New Zealand in \u2013 and we will always remain\ngrateful to two expat Indians for bailing us out on Christmas Day. None of us had an idea that\neverything in Wellington, including restaurants, would remain shut between the night of  and the\nmorning of  December. In India all restaurants and hotels are open on Christmas Day, with people\neating out to celebrate the occasion. In Wellington, even the team hotel would not serve food and the\nteam was left to fend for themselves. That\u2019s when Mori Patel, Ilesh Patel and Nanu bhai came to our\nrescue.\nMori bhai, Ilesh bhai and Nanu bhai are residents of Wellington, and on Christmas Day they came\nover to our hotel with all sorts of amazing food. We all enjoyed feasting on the fantastic Indian food\nthat had been specially prepared for us. Apart from not starving on Christmas Day, it meant we could\nalso get a taste of fantastic home-cooked Indian food. Over the years, the Patels came to watch a lot of\nour games in New Zealand and sometimes even travelled to Australia to see us play. Each time they\nwould bring food and tea for us. Ilesh bhai\u2019s desi chai (Indian tea) was a hit among the players and\neach time I saw him I would ask, \u2018Ilesh bhai chai nahi pilayenge kya?\u2019 (Ilesh bhai, would you not get\nus to drink tea today?)\nIt was in New Zealand that Sara started to speak. She said her first nursery rhyme in the course of\nthis tour and each word she said made me feel immensely fulfilled and delighted.\n\nA painful series\nWhile I was gradually adjusting to the responsibilities of fatherhood, I suffered my first serious\ninjury, a back problem from which I took more than eight months to fully recover. The problem\nsurfaced in Chennai at the end of January  during the first Test against Pakistan.\nPakistan had come to India after a gap of thirteen years and the entire country was focused on the\n\n\ftwo-Test series and the Asian Test Championship involving India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka that was to\nfollow. Pakistan had a versatile bowling attack, with Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and the offspinner Saqlain Mushtaq, leg-spinner Shahid Afridi and slow left-arm orthodox spinner Nadeem Khan\nall in good form, and there was no doubt it would be a keenly contested series.\nThe Chennai match lived up to the hype and after three days of gripping Test cricket, India were left\nwith a target of  in the fourth innings. It was a difficult run chase, as Wasim and Waqar started out\nvery well for Pakistan, reducing us to \u2013 on the third evening. I walked out with just under an hour\nleft on the third day, with Wasim and Waqar still charging in and full of energy. Rahul was already\nout there and we knew we needed to see out the rest of the day and resume battle the following\nmorning. These little sessions are always tricky because the bowling side know they can come back\nrefreshed the next morning and so they throw everything at the batsmen, in the hope of getting a bonus\nwicket. For the batting team there\u2019s little to be gained and the priority is not to lose another wicket.\nWaqar welcomed me to the crease with a couple of bouncers and even walked up to me on one\noccasion to say, \u2018Ball nazar aayi?\u2019 (Did you see the ball?) I didn\u2019t say a thing, but my eye contact was\nenough to give him the message. I hardly moved and he was soon walking back to his bowling mark. I\nremember muttering to myself, \u2018You are not bowling that quick, my friend.\u2019 This exchange only\nhelped to strengthen my resolve and I was unbeaten on  at the end of play, determined to win the\nTest match on the fourth day.\nRahul was not out at the other end and there are not many other players you would rather bat with in\na situation like that. He has always been rock solid. The next morning, however, the usual script was\ntorn up when Rahul was bowled by a beauty from Wasim. Azhar soon followed and when Sourav got\nout we were down to \u2013 and badly needed a partnership.\nWhen Nayan Mongia came out to join me in the middle I asked him to be patient and just play\nhimself in. With the cream of our batting back in the dressing room, I realized it was time for me to\ntake charge. I was fully focused on the job at hand and had gone into a zone where I was praying\nbefore each ball was bowled. Even when Nayan was on strike I was rehearsing in my mind how I\u2019d\nhave played the balls bowled to him. In effect, I was trying to bat at both ends. As I concentrated\nreally hard, everything else around me seemed a blur and all I knew was that I had to bat through to\nthe end of the game.\nAnd then the pain struck. It was forty-five minutes before tea when I felt a scorching pain in my\nback. By now Nayan and I had put together a good partnership and the game was starting to tilt ever so\nslightly towards India. But Pakistan had yet to take the new ball and I knew we still had a fair amount\nof work to do. Wasim and Waqar would give their best in one final burst. The hot and humid\nconditions in Chennai were harsh and I was starting to suffer from cramp. Playing each ball was\nturning out to be an ordeal and the pain in my back was becoming unbearable. The tea break came as a\nblessed relief. I remember lying flat on a towel in the dressing room with cold towels spread all over\nme to bring down my body temperature. My whole body was cramping up and I knew it was going to\nbe really difficult to bat for two more hours.\nAfter tea I had no choice but to attack the bowling, because I knew my back was about to give up. I\ninformed Nayan of the change in strategy and hit a few boundaries in the next few overs. Soon the\ntarget was down to manageable proportions and we just needed to play out the second new ball. We\nhad put on  runs for the sixth wicket and Pakistan were gradually losing their grip on the match. In\nfact, we were cruising along when Nayan got out to a bad shot. He tried a slog to a Wasim delivery\nand top-edged the ball in the process. There was no need to play that shot and it had once again given\nPakistan a ray of hope. It was a sad end to a very good innings from Nayan.\n\n\fSunil Joshi, who came in next, settled well and even hit a six off Saqlain during his forty-minute\nstay at the wicket. We made  in the six overs after Nayan got out and the target was now just  runs\naway. In the meantime my back had all but given up on me and I was finding it difficult to stand up\nstraight. Every movement was hurting and every shot increased the pain. I soon realized that all-out\nattack was my only option. Unable to bear the pain any longer, I tried to hit a Saqlain doosra \u2013 the offspinner\u2019s delivery that goes the other way from normal after pitching, a ball that Saqlain was the first\nto master \u2013 over mid off for another boundary. The ball bounced more than expected and I ended up\ntop-edging the ball. I could see Wasim getting under the ball at mid off and was praying for him to\ndrop the catch. But I was out for  and was devastated.\nIt was a painful walk back to the pavilion. Even the standing ovation from the crowd did little to\nalleviate the pain at not having finished the match. However, I must say that I really did not expect us\nto lose the match from there, with just  runs to get and three wickets, including Srinath and Kumble,\nstill left. In fact, I couldn\u2019t believe what was happening when we were bowled out for  and lost by\n runs. My world seemed to collapse around me and I just couldn\u2019t hold back the tears in the dressing\nroom. My back was in horrible shape and mentally I was at a serious low.\nIt was the only time in my life when I didn\u2019t go out to receive the Man of the Match award. Raj\nSingh Dungarpur tried to persuade me but I said to him that I was in no state, physically or mentally,\nto leave the dressing room. He understood and left me to myself. Even when we were leaving for\nDelhi the next morning, I couldn\u2019t even carry my hand luggage. It was as if someone was sticking\nneedles into my back all the time and I couldn\u2019t sit in one position for more than two or three minutes.\nIn hindsight, I should not have played the Delhi and Kolkata Test matches that followed, but my\nurge to play against Pakistan drove me on. I had told the BCCI all about my physical condition and\nthey had left it up to me whether to play or not and at the time I felt I would be able push myself.\nThe second Test, starting in Delhi on  February , was very much Anil Kumble\u2019s match and it\nwas his world-record spell of \u2013 in the second innings that helped us level the series. Anil has won\nmany Test matches for India and he was unplayable at the Kotla in Delhi, as he became only the\nsecond bowler in the history of Test cricket, after Jim Laker in , to pick up all ten wickets in an\ninnings. In Pakistan\u2019s second innings I handed Anil\u2019s sweater and cap to umpire Arani Jayaprakash\nbefore every over he bowled. It worked well for us and there was no reason to change the pattern. It\nseems incredible to think that Anil singlehandedly won us a Test match against Pakistan, but he\ncertainly did.\nThe two-Test series was followed by the Asian Test Championship and India played Pakistan in the\ninaugural match of this new competition at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, which started on  February.\nMany looked upon it as the third and deciding leg of the bilateral series. I remember the match for the\nway I was run out in the second innings. Chasing  for victory, we were well placed at \u2013 when I\nwalked out to bat. I was in the process of playing myself in when I clipped a Wasim delivery past wide\nmid on. The ball was finally pulled up yards from the rope by the substitute fielder Nadeem Khan. I\nwas jogging to the crease for an easy third run when the throw came in on the full to hit the stumps.\nDespite the direct hit, I would have been well in if I hadn\u2019t collided with Shoaib Akhtar. Shoaib, who\nwas fielding at mid off, had come forward to back up the throw and was standing a few yards behind\nthe stumps, right in my line of running. I could not comprehend why he was standing there rather than\nright behind the stumps. With my eyes on the ball, I collided with him moments after I had run my bat\nin. As a result of the collision, my bat was in the air when the ball hit the stumps.\nWhile not imputing any motive to Shoaib, I must say I was shocked to see the Pakistanis appeal for\nthe run-out. The crowd, sensing the injustice, turned violent and started throwing things onto the\n\n\fground. After walking off, finding it difficult to come to terms with the incident, I went straight to the\nthird umpire\u2019s room to check the replay and was dismayed to see what had really happened.\nBecause of the crowd disturbance, the match had to be stopped for a good twenty minutes, and\nfinally Jagmohan Dalmiya, then president of the ICC and one of India\u2019s most distinguished\nadministrators, came to our dressing room to ask if I would go out and pacify the crowd. I didn\u2019t\nreally feel like it, because I felt wronged, but I changed my mind to ensure there was no further\nviolence at Eden Gardens. It was only after Jagmohan Dalmiya and I appealed to the crowd that the\nmatch was finally allowed to resume.\nThe sense of outrage, however, was still there and the crowd turned violent again the following\nmorning, resulting in unreal scenes towards the end of the match. In an unprecedented move, ,\npeople were forced to vacate the stadium and the match was completed without a single spectator\ninside the ground. Perhaps it could all have been avoided if Shoaib had not stood in my way or if\nWasim had withdrawn the appeal.\nIndia lost the Test match by  runs and the way the match ended left us all feeling rather bitter.\n\nLosing my father\nContinuing to play on with my back injury had unfortunately aggravated the problem. As a result, I\nplayed the World Cup in England in May and June  in considerable physical discomfort. But the\nWorld Cup was not a tournament I could miss and I did all I could to get ready. Every time I trained,\nmy back would get stiff and I would need a cooling-off period for it to settle down. The fickle English\nweather did not help matters and I was advised to sleep on the floor of the hotel room with a pillow\nbelow my knee, to make sure that my back was flat on the ground. In time, I learnt to sleep in the tiny\ngap between the bed and the cupboard in most hotel rooms, which ensured there wasn\u2019t much space\nfor me to toss and turn.\nAjit, Anjali and Sara were all in England before the World Cup and that was a great comfort. We\nwould go out for meals together and it was during one of these dinners at a Chinese restaurant that I\nordered crispy aromatic duck. I just love to eat this dish served with thin pancakes and sliced\ncucumber and can finish a portion on my own. However, just as I placed my order, Ajit asked me to\ncancel it. He declared that he would not allow me to eat duck before the World Cup. While I found it\namusing at first, I soon realized he was serious and felt obliged to do what he wanted. When I asked\nhim his reasons, he said he had read an article which said that three English players had once gone out\nfor a meal before a very important match and they had all had duck for dinner. Subsequently each one\ngot out without scoring. Of course, in cricket a \u2018duck\u2019 is associated with a batsman scoring zero and\non the Australian television coverage a duck is even shown accompanying a batsman back to the\npavilion if he gets out without scoring. Ajit said to me I could have as much duck as I wanted once the\nWorld Cup was over!\nJust before the tournament started Anjali decided to go back to London, leaving me to focus solely\non my cricket. In the second trimester of her pregnancy and with one-and-a-half-year-old Sara with\nher, it must have been immensely difficult for her to negotiate things on her own. While I missed her\nbadly and desperately wanted to be with her to help out, there was little I could do but appreciate what\nshe was doing for me and the family.\nIt was in the middle of all this that I received the news of my father\u2019s passing. Ajit, who had gone\nback to India by then, called Anjali to tell her what had happened and asked her to break the news to\nme personally. Anjali in turn called two of my team-mates, Robin Singh and Ajay Jadeja, and asked\n\n\fthem to be outside my room as she drove back to the team hotel in Leicester very late at night on \nMay \u2013 the day before our second match of the tournament, against Zimbabwe. She also called the\nhotel manager and asked him not to transfer any calls to my room.\nWhen I opened the door at well past midnight and saw her standing with Ajay and Robin I\nimmediately sensed something serious had happened. Atul Ranade, one of my closest friends, was\nwith me in my room and I asked Atul to go out as Anjali came in. I could not believe what she was\nsaying. It was a cruel blow and not something I had expected at all. It left me numb for a few minutes.\nI could not say a thing. Father had always been there for me. My mind had stopped working and all I\ncould do was hold Anjali and cry. I felt helpless and was unable to come to terms with the shock for a\nwhile.\nMy first thought was to go back to India at the earliest opportunity to be with my mother and see\nmy father one final time. Mark Mascarenhas, as always, had already made all the arrangements for the\nfollowing morning and drove the two of us to Heathrow just before dawn. All through the journey I\nkept thinking about my father, who had been in reasonable health when I had left India for the World\nCup. In fact, I couldn\u2019t believe he was not alive and felt that if I went back to India he would open his\neyes again. He had undergone angioplasty a few months earlier and had stayed with us, so that Anjali\ncould take care of him. By the time I left for the World Cup, he seemed back to his normal self and\nhad even started to climb three floors. The doctors had asked him to have a drink every evening and I\nmade a point of coming home most evenings to share a drink with him. In my wildest dreams I had\nnever imagined that I would be sharing a drink with my father, but medical advice had forced me to do\nso. The thought that I would never see him again was just too much to digest.\nMy brothers and friends had come to pick me up at Mumbai airport but this was a very different\nhomecoming from normal. When I got home I could see that my mother had aged considerably in the\npast few days and was sitting facing the wall. She hardly said a word to anyone and was in a state of\nshock. I felt devastated to see my mother like that and what was more worrying was that she did not\nmove from her position for close to two days. It became unbearable when I came face to face with my\ngrandmother, who had lost her son. She said to me that she wanted to spend a few quiet minutes with\nhim and I immediately asked all who were present to leave us alone for a while. I accompanied my\ngrandmother to the room where my father\u2019s body was lying, then left her to mourn with her son in\npeace. I remember standing a good few yards away, giving her the space she needed.\nI couldn\u2019t sleep for many nights having lost my biggest inspiration. And it was a deeply emotional\nmoment for all of us when the watchmen, postmen and all the other people he had helped during his\nlife came over for his funeral. I put a gold coin with my face on it in his pocket before the cremation,\nso that I could always be there with him.\nWithout my father, my life would never be the same again.\n\nA very difficult tournament\nAfter spending four days in India, I returned to England to rejoin the team on the eve of the match\nagainst Kenya. That, it seemed to me, was what my father would have wanted me to do, and that\u2019s\nwhat prompted the decision to return to London to play the remaining World Cup matches. Mentally,\nhowever, I was not at my best throughout the tournament. I had to wear dark glasses during the\npractice sessions, because at times I could not hold back my tears. Though I managed to score a\nhundred in the match against Kenya \u2013 which remains one of my most cherished centuries, one I\ndedicated to my father \u2013 my mind was not always on the game.\n\n\fThe back injury, which had not shown any signs of improvement, also continued to bother me\nthroughout the rest of the World Cup, helping to make it one of the toughest tournaments I have\nplayed in. It wasn\u2019t India\u2019s best World Cup either and we were knocked out in the Super Six stage\nafter winning a couple of memorable matches against Sri Lanka and England at the group stage.\nAgainst Sri Lanka at Taunton on  May , Sourav and Rahul played two of the finest innings I\nhave seen in a World Cup. Sourav was at his elegant best on his way to a majestic  and Rahul\nplayed beautifully for his . In our next match against England on  May, Sourav yet again made a\nsignificant all-round contribution, to give us a much-needed win, and Rahul was consistent right\nthrough the tournament.\nAt the Super Six stage our only consolation was another win against Pakistan. The match had\nassumed great significance against the backdrop of strained political relations between the two\ncountries \u2013 the war in Kargil in Kashmir was on at the time. India won the highly charged encounter\nby  runs, with Venkatesh Prasad picking up a five-wicket haul.\n\nAn unexpected appointment\nThe back pain continued to bother me after the World Cup and in fact turned worse in the twin\ntournaments in Sri Lanka and Singapore in August\u2013September , at the end of which I decided to\ngo to Australia to get my back examined. I had already resorted to acupuncture and acupressure \u2013 and\neven had my tongue pricked by an expert in Singapore trying to identify the pressure points that might\nhelp in the recovery. They were the acts of an increasingly desperate man.\nDr Anant Joshi, one of India\u2019s leading doctors and one who has always been there for me right\nthrough my career, travelled with me to Adelaide in September  to meet a number of specialists.\nA series of checks were conducted and I eventually received four injections for the injury. I was glad I\ncould not see the injections at the time because afterwards I realized I had never seen bigger needles\nin my life. I actually carried one back to show my friends and family and nobody could believe the\nsize of them. But they did the job, and soon after my return to India the back injury that had bothered\nme for eight months was finally sorted. It was certainly a relief to be pain-free.\nMy determination was even greater because in August  I had been appointed captain of India\nagain, despite having deep reservations about taking on the job for a second time. What happened was\nthat Ajit Wadekar had come to my house to ask me if I was prepared to captain India again and I told\nhim that I was reluctant to do so. The next I heard was that I had been appointed captain ahead of a triseries in Sri Lanka in August. It appears that Wadekar Sir had come over to speak to me on behalf of\nthe BCCI and it was after consultation with him that the selectors had decided to give me the\nresponsibility, despite my unwillingness. Once the appointment was made public it was difficult for\nme to turn it down. I have never ducked a challenge and I went on to accept the job, determined to\ngive it my best. We were due to tour Australia at the end of the year and I knew it was the toughest\nassignment in cricket at the time.\n\nA new arrival\nAll of this coincided with the birth of our second child, when Anjali and I were blessed with a baby\nboy on  September . I decided to name him Arjun and remember announcing my intention to\nAnjali soon after I had seen my son for the first time. She later mentioned to me that she had thought\nof a few other names herself but, seeing my enthusiasm for Arjun, went ahead with my choice. Once\n\n\fagain I filmed the day and I cherish the recording of Arjun being brought out to me for the first time.\nWatching the children grow up is a fantastic feeling and I must say I missed them every time I was\naway from them. With Arjun it was particularly hard. He would resent my going away and would\nrefuse to speak to me on the phone. For the first six years of his life Arjun never talked to me when I\nwas on tour. In my desperation to hear his voice I often requested Anjali to ask him to say hello, but\nhe would always refuse. Then, on my return, he would cling to me for the first three days, trying to\nmake up for lost time.\nWhile Sara did not seem to resent my going in the same way as Arjun, she did find it difficult on\noccasions to bond with me on my return. Sara was just a few months old when I had to travel to Sri\nLanka for a tour. It was extremely hot in Colombo and I returned home with quite a tan at the end of\nthe assignment. I had turned really dark and she didn\u2019t recognize me. She thought someone else had\nwalked in and she refused to go near me for the first few minutes!\nWhen I had my kids at the turn of the century, technology was not as advanced as now and there\nwas no option to use Skype or FaceTime. Had the technology been available, I\u2019m sure I would have\nasked Anjali to bring Sara and Arjun in front of the webcam so that I could at least see my kids when I\nwas off in some other part of the world. It would have meant not missing out on so many of the\nchanges they went through.\n\nNew Zealand in India, October\u2013November \nAfter a couple of weeks at home following Arjun\u2019s birth, I was back on the field at Mohali on \nOctober captaining India against New Zealand in the first of three Tests. Just like the first time, the\nstart to my captaincy was not too bad, as we beat New Zealand in the series, though we made it hard\nfor ourselves in the very first innings at Mohali when we were bowled out for , with Dion Nash\ntaking six wickets. It was just one of those days when nothing worked and we collapsed for one of our\nlowest ever scores on home soil. It seemed as if the ghost of Barbados was back to haunt me. This\ntime, however, our bowlers did a good job restricting the Kiwis to  and we batted with a lot more\ndiscipline in the second innings. We scored , losing just three wickets, with both Rahul and me\nscoring hundreds, and the game ended in a draw.\nThe second innings, however, was not without incident. Chris Cairns, the New Zealand all-rounder,\nbowled a spell of excellent reverse swing. Part of the problem for Rahul and me was that he concealed\nthe shiny side of the ball so well that there was no way for the batsman to work out which way the ball\nwould swing. That\u2019s when I came up with a plan. I suggested to Rahul that while it was impossible for\nthe striker, it was not so difficult for the non-striker to work it out as he was far closer to Cairns. It\nwas decided that while standing at the non-striker\u2019s end, I would spot the shiny side and if it was on\nthe outside of the ball, I would hold my bat in my left hand to indicate to Rahul that the ball would\nswing away from him. If the shiny side was on the inside, I would hold my bat in my right hand to\nindicate that the ball would be coming in to him. And if I was not able to figure out which way the ball\nwould swing, I would hold my bat in the middle.\nThe plan worked surprisingly well and soon we were able to attack Cairns, who ended up going for\n runs in his twenty-four overs without picking up a wicket. It took a while for Cairns to work out\nwhat we were doing. To catch us unawares, he decided to bowl a cross-seam delivery, so I held my bat\nin the middle to indicate to Rahul that I didn\u2019t know which way the ball would swing. Soon after\ndelivering the ball, Cairns turned towards me to see what I was doing. He was angry and frustrated and\nwanted to know how I had reacted to him bowling a cross-seam delivery. Winning this battle against\n\n\fChris Cairns definitely helped us save the match.\nIn the second Test match, at Kanpur, we beat New Zealand comprehensively, with Kumble picking\nup ten wickets in the game, and in the final Test at Ahmedabad I scored a double hundred in a drawn\nencounter. At Ahmedabad we scored a mammoth  runs in the first innings and, despite bowling the\nopposition out for , did not enforce the follow-on. This was a unanimous decision taken in\nconsultation with the fast bowlers, who were tired after an exhausting first-innings effort and needed\nsome rest before they bowled again. We won the series \u2013 and then went on to win the ODI series \u2013\n. It may not have been ideal preparation for the tour to Australia that started at the end of the month,\nbut a series win never does any harm.\n\nIndia in Australia, November \u2013January \nDuring my second stint as captain we had Kapil Dev as our coach. He is one of the finest cricketers to\nhave played for India and one of the best all-rounders of all time, and I had great expectations of him\nin Australia. I have always maintained that the coach\u2019s job is an important one, for he is in a position\nto play a key role in formulating team strategy. Who better than Kapil to come up with options for me\nduring a tough tour of Australia? However, his method of involvement and his thought process was\nlimited to leaving the running of the team to the captain, and hence he did not involve himself in\nstrategic discussions that would help us on the field.\nThings did not start badly for us in Australia. Unlike in South Africa in \u2013, we reached\nAustralia a good two weeks before the series started and played three practice games before the first\nTest. All in all, we weren\u2019t underprepared when we walked onto the field at the Adelaide Oval on \nDecember , and if the first morning was anything to go by, we were in with a good chance against\nthe best team in the world.\nJavagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad bowled extremely well to reduce Australia to \u2013 before\nlunch and we needed just one more wicket to get into the Australian lower middle order. We almost\nhad that wicket in the form of the always dangerous Ricky Ponting, but he was given not out to a very\nclose lbw shout early in his innings. He escaped again when he clearly under-edged a ball from Ajit\nAgarkar to the wicketkeeper MSK Prasad when on  but was again not adjudged out. Australia were\nstill not out of the woods at that stage and that could well have been the opening we were looking for.\nHowever, luck was with Ponting on the day and he and Steve Waugh both went on to make big\nhundreds.\nWhen it was our turn to bat, I faced a probing spell from Glenn McGrath towards the end of the\nday\u2019s play, playing out five or six maiden overs in the process. Some people may have wondered why\nI allowed McGrath to bowl those maidens and why I was not playing my natural game, but Test\ncricket is all about getting into the mind of the opposition. After that passage of play, the Australians\nchanged their tactics, and later Shane Warne told me that I had forced them to make the change. The\nAustralian plan, I was told, was to make me leave  per cent of the deliveries in each innings. But\nwith me playing out the maiden overs, they realized that attempts to frustrate me wouldn\u2019t work. The\nnext morning, I changed my strategy and hit McGrath for two boundaries in the first over.\nIn this Test match we were at the receiving end of what seemed to us to be a howler from umpire\nDaryl Harper. Sourav and I had embarked on a good fightback and I had scored . The team score\nwas at \u2013 and another hundred runs could have helped set up the match, but just as we were\nlooking to consolidate, Daryl Harper gave me out bat-pad to Shane Warne, caught by Justin Langer at\nforward short leg. I was sure I hadn\u2019t hit the ball. Warne had pitched the delivery on my legs and the\n\n\fball simply hit the pad before being caught by Langer. In the second innings I felt I was unlucky again.\nGlenn McGrath tried to bounce one at me but the ball actually stayed low. I instinctively ducked and it\nhit me on my shoulder. To everyone\u2019s surprise, umpire Harper declared me out lbw. It was a strange\ndecision, because there was surely no way it would have gone on to hit the stumps.\nWhile I\u2019m not trying to excuse our under-par performance, there\u2019s no doubt that those decisions\nplayed a huge role in such a hard-fought Test match. To Australia\u2019s credit, they capitalized on the\nopportunities and went \u2013 up as a result. In the second and third Tests of the series, however, we\nwere comprehensively outplayed. Even when VVS Laxman produced a magical  in Sydney in the\nthird Test, something that prompted me to ask the selectors to keep him back for the ODI series that\nfollowed, the result was never in doubt. McGrath and Brett Lee, who made his debut in the series,\nwere exceptional and had great back-up in Damien Fleming and Shane Warne. We were never allowed\nto take charge and there\u2019s no harm in conceding that Steve Waugh\u2019s Australian team in  was one\nof the best teams I ever played against.\nPersonally I had a pretty good series and batted well for a hundred at the MCG in the Boxing Day\nTest. However, it counted for nothing because I was not able to change the fortunes of the team. A\nhundred in a losing cause is something of a bitter pill. Even in the second innings I scored  and\nwhile it was a personal milestone, it was not enough to save the game.\nAfter the \u2013 defeat in the Test series we lost the ODI tri-series with Pakistan and Australia, failing\neven to make the final. The tour had gone from bad to worse and I was deeply frustrated. On my way\nback to India I was going through serious mental turmoil. I was finding it difficult to unwind. In the\npast I had been able to leave the disappointments of cricket behind and switch off. Not this time. Even\nwhen I was with my kids, my mind was still on the series. I was unable to figure out what I was doing\nwrong. I was failing to get the team to play to their potential and it was all starting to get to me.\nAs a batsman, I was accountable for my own mistakes and could do what was required to sort out\nmy flaws and get back to form. As a captain it was not. As skipper, I was responsible for the actions of\nmy team-mates, but I couldn\u2019t control everything they did. For example, sometimes I carefully put a\nplan in place but it was simply not implemented, which I found hard to cope with.\nThe ODI against Pakistan in Brisbane on  January  is a case in point. It was a low-scoring\ngame and we had made  batting first in our fifty overs. Pakistan, docked an over for a slow over\nrate, were reduced to \u2013 at one point in their innings. Clearly, we should have closed out the match\nfrom that position. Eventually, however, Pakistan won the match off the last ball, with Saqlain\nMushtaq and Waqar Younis taking the team over the line with an unbeaten -run stand for the ninth\nwicket.\nThe defeat particularly hurt me because I had predicted what the Pakistani batsmen were planning\nin the final stages of the innings. While fielding at mid off, I had repeatedly spoken to my fast bowlers\nand had specifically asked them not to bowl a slower ball without informing me. Despite my repeated\nwarnings, one of them bowled a slower ball without the proper field in place and the Pakistan batsman\npromptly dispatched it to the boundary. Such incidents caused me immense frustration and I was\nfinding it increasingly difficult to get them out of my mind.\n\nOver to Sourav\nEven before the start of the Australia series, I had spoken to the selectors about appointing Sourav\nGanguly as my deputy. I had always felt he had the ability to lead the team in my absence. If I got\ninjured in Australia or had to leave the field temporarily, I wanted Sourav to be in charge of the side.\n\n\fWithin weeks of coming back from Australia I had communicated to BCCI president AC Muthiah\nand the selection committee that I did not want to continue as captain. It was in the best interests of\nthe team to pass the baton to Sourav and focus on my batting. At the same time, we did not want to\nspring the Indian captaincy on him and leave him unsettled. He needed a little time to come to terms\nwith the pressures and it was my responsibility to ensure that the transition was smooth. So I informed\nthe selectors that I was happy to lead the side in the two home Tests against South Africa in February\n. It was agreed that Sourav would take over after the Test series and before the start of the fivematch ODI series.\nI had discussed my decision with my family in Lonavla, where we had gone for a break. They were\nall in agreement that the frustration of not achieving what I wanted with the team was affecting me\nbadly and that I was pushing myself too hard. Anjali knew how I was feeling and I also spoke to Ajit\nat length about what I was going through.\n\nNever again\nAfter giving up the captaincy at the start of , I never captained India again. That is not to say I\nwasn\u2019t given the choice of captaining the team later in my career. I was actually offered the job quite a\nfew times but was never tempted. One occasion was soon after Rahul Dravid stepped down after the\ntour of England in September .\nThe final time I was offered the job was at the end of Anil\u2019s captaincy in late . We were in the\nmiddle of a home series against Australia and Anil\u2019s retirement had left a huge void. This time I\nrecommended MS Dhoni. Earlier I had recommended him as captain for the Twenty World Cup,\nand Test captaincy was a natural progression.\nDhoni had already captained the team with distinction in the Twenty format and had also done\nwell in the fifty-over format. He was one of the few players who played all formats of the game and\nread the game well at critical times. Having discussed things with him when fielding in the slip\ncordon, I knew he was a good choice for the job and had little hesitation in putting his name forward.\nHe had age on his side and would be able to guide Indian cricket into the future.\nAll of the people I recommended or played under after giving up the captaincy \u2013 Sourav Ganguly,\nRahul Dravid, Anil Kumble or MS Dhoni \u2013 I had a good relationship with, and when I felt it necessary\nI would give them my opinion and then leave it to them to take the final call. As a senior player in the\nside, I felt it was my job to give the captain options, as he had way too much on his plate and it was\nsometimes easy to miss things. I loved being involved and they all seemed to welcome my\ncontributions. The final decision was always the captain\u2019s, but I felt it was important for me to let\nthem know what I thought was best for the team.\nEvery captain I played under had his respective strengths. Sourav was an excellent strategist and\nhad a very good understanding of the game. He was an aggressive captain and wasn\u2019t afraid to\nexperiment in difficult situations. It was under Sourav that we started winning overseas Test matches\nconsistently.\nAnil Kumble was an excellent communicator and clearly explained to the players what he wanted\nfrom each of them. He was aggressive and trusted his instincts. Sourav and Anil were both great\nplayers and equally capable leaders.\nRahul, on the other hand, was more conventional. He was more methodical and his mental\ntoughness was an added strength. He was committed to the job but stayed away from experimenting\ntoo much. Dhoni, in contrast, was impulsive and loved to back his instincts. He has a really good grasp\n\n\fof the game and is not afraid to try something different. He is never flustered and handles pressure\nwell. Under these men India won some big series and tournaments and I enjoyed playing with them\nall.\nAmong the captains I played against, I consider Nasser Hussain the best. He was an excellent\nstrategist and even if some of his tactics occasionally bordered on the negative \u2013 using the left-arm\nspinner Ashley Giles to bowl to me outside my leg stump from over the wicket, for example \u2013 he was\na very good thinker about the game and was proactive. Nasser would not place a fielder in a particular\nposition after a shot was played. Rather, he had the ability to anticipate the shot and would place a\nfielder well in advance, making a real difference to his team.\nAmong the Australians, I rate Michael Clarke as the best captain I played against. While I was too\nyoung to judge Allan Border in , the other Australian captains in Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh and\nRicky Ponting benefited from having some of the greatest players of our generation in their teams.\nWith so many match-winners, the role of the captain is automatically reduced. Clarke\u2019s case, however,\nwas different. He had to rebuild the Australian team from scratch and to do so in such a short time\nspeaks volumes for his ability as leader.\nGraeme Smith of South Africa is yet another player I have great regard for as skipper. Taking over\nthe reins of the side at the age of twenty-two in the most tumultuous of conditions, Smith did\nbrilliantly to propel South Africa to the top of the world Test rankings.\nLooking back at my own captaincy career, I feel I could have achieved better results during my first\nstint as captain had there been more cooperation. I never felt totally comfortable with the relationship\nwith the selectors. This was reflected in the teams I was given, which were not always the ones I\nwould have chosen. In my first stint as captain of India, it seemed that each series was a personal test\nand losing one series badly meant my position was immediately in question. Such pressure did not\nalways send out the best signal and it was as if I was constantly being evaluated. Every captain sets\nout to win but it\u2019s not always possible to do so in international sport. The opposition were also playing\nto win and at times they simply played better cricket than we did. That was the case in Australia in\nDecember .\nThere is no point lamenting what could have been. It was time to look beyond the captaincy and\ncontribute to the team in the best way possible. I am glad I was able to do so for a good thirteen years\nafter giving up the captaincy in February .\n\nThe difficulty of being a Tendulkar\nThere is a common misconception that cricketers\u2019 families have an easy time of it. On the contrary, in\nmy absence Anjali had to do most of the parenting, and bringing up two young kids almost on her own\nwas anything but easy. For the children too it was hard at times. They were not always able to do the\nthings normal kids enjoy and, with their father away for long periods, they missed out on fatherly\naffection and care.\nWhen Arjun was just nine months old, for example, I was going to Germany to visit the Adidas\nfactory and asked Anjali if she would like to come along. I was going for only five days and Anjali\nhadn\u2019t left home for nine months \u2013 after Arjun\u2019s birth. We left Sara and Arjun with her parents in\nIndia. It was on the third night away that calamity struck. We had finished work in the Adidas factory\nand had retreated to a small village for the evening when Anjali got a call from Dr Ajit\nGajendragadkar, who asked us to come back as soon as possible. We were informed that Anjali\u2019s\nmother had suffered a brain haemorrhage (from which she later recovered) and was in the hospital\n\n\funconscious, while Arjun was seriously sick at home.\nIt was night-time in Germany and the earliest we could leave for India was the following morning.\nAll through the journey the next day we kept worrying about who was taking care of nine-month-old\nArjun. When we finally got home, the first sight of Arjun reduced us both to tears. He had lost weight\nand had a pained expression in his eyes. While there was a glint of happiness in seeing us both back at\nhome, his expression was predominantly one of hurt, as if to ask why we had to leave him and go\naway. Since then, Anjali has never left the kids alone at home to travel abroad with me.\nAnother example occurred soon after we had been knocked out of the World Cup in the Caribbean\nin March . We had played poorly in the tournament and it was a low for the country. My family\nwere aware that the repercussions of the first-round exit might reach the kids. As a precautionary\nmeasure, Anjali tried to explain to Arjun, who was seven years old at the time, that if someone made a\nsnide comment about his dad at school, he should ignore it; he should just say that it was\ndisappointing and we would surely do better the next time. When a friend of his accosted him at\nschool and said that India had lost because his dad had got out for zero, our advice went out of his\nhead and Arjun punched the boy and told him not to say anything bad about his father again.\nWhile Sara is interested in studying science, Arjun, who started with football, now wants to play\ncricket. I am perfectly happy with them doing whatever they want to do. In the last few years Sara has\nchanged perceptibly and has started taking far more responsibility. Anjali has allowed her the freedom\nto shape her timetable and she is showing signs of maturity. She went to Oxford in the summer of\n for her summer school and is happy pursuing her dream of becoming a doctor. I\u2019d be delighted\nto see her do so and have always felt that the best thing for parents is to allow kids to chase their own\ndreams. That\u2019s what I did and it\u2019s what I want my daughter to do as well.\nArjun, on the other hand, is deeply passionate about cricket. Mind you, he and I hardly ever spoke\nabout the game till he turned seven. I would chat with him about everything else but never talk cricket\nat home. This was an attempt to keep my professional world separate; I found it often helped to keep\nthe two spheres distinct from each other. So much so that my wife and children have hardly ever come\nto the stadium to watch me play. Anjali has been to the stadium just a handful of times in her life. The\nfirst time she saw me bat was at Edgbaston in  when I scored a hundred. She was with her father\nat the time. The second time was in Melbourne in , when I was out for a first-ball duck.\nThereafter, she didn\u2019t come to the stadium again till my th Test match at Eden Gardens in\nNovember . Instead, she had a special seat at home for watching matches on TV and refused to\nspeak to anyone or take phone calls when I was batting. That was her way of being with me the whole\ntime.\nArjun has come to my games frequently, however, and has travelled with me to England, Australia\nand South Africa. Arjun got seriously attracted to cricket after watching India win the inaugural world\nTwenty in September . We watched the matches together at home and he was hugely inspired\nto see the Indian triumph in South Africa.\nMany have asked me if I feel added pressure at Arjun trying to become a cricketer. I really don\u2019t. I\nam happy that he is trying to do something he enjoys, for that in itself will make him really happy.\nAlso there is nothing negative about playing a sport. While it is never possible to guarantee\nperformance, one can guarantee the effort put in and there\u2019s no doubt that he is putting his best foot\nforward. I am not concerned with how far he goes with his game, but am happy that he is doing his\nbest to excel in what he loves. I firmly believe that you take to playing cricket only if you are madly in\nlove with it. And that\u2019s what has happened with Arjun over the last few years. There\u2019s no doubt there\nwill be pressure on him every time he plays. But he has chosen what he wants to do and will have to\n\n\fdeal with that pressure as best he can.\nIndia in New Zealand \u2013\nst Test.

I have played with the current generation of cricketers who now\nconstitute the core of the Indian team. Batting, I feel, will continue to be our strength and the current\ncrop, which is a good mix of experience and youth, will surely play together for many years and serve\nthe country with distinction. On the bowling side, while some of our bowlers are doing well, we need\nto find a few more talented fast bowlers. In the past we have had some really good bowling pairs, but\nwhat we need now is a bowling unit that will play for the team at the same time. This is a tough\nchallenge, but with the depth of talent available in the country, I am sure we are up to it.\nFinally, the game of cricket itself is extremely vibrant. Cricket is the only sport that has three\ndistinctive formats and each format has a constituency of its own. While Test cricket will always\nremain the pinnacle, one-day international cricket too is in good shape, with the Champions Trophy\nand the fifty-over World Cup seeing tremendous support the world over. Also, Twenty continues to\nattract the youth, as shown by the popularity of the IPL.\nA lot of people have asked me what I will be doing in the future. Frankly, I don\u2019t know. When I\nstarted out playing cricket at eleven years of age I had no idea I would go on to play for India or would\nplay  Test matches. All I knew was that I wanted to play the game well and enjoy every moment. I\nstayed in the moment and lived each situation as they came to me.\nI had never thought there would come a time when I would not be able to go out for walks with my\nchildren, or take them shopping, that going out to watch a film or taking my family out for dinner\nwould require meticulous planning. However, I don\u2019t regret any of it, for all of that is a small price to\npay for the affection and warmth the people of my country have showered on me all the way through\nmy career.\nI am in a very similar state at the start of my second innings. All I am doing now is trying to spend\na lot of time with my family and sometimes not doing anything at all! This was impossible when I was\nan active cricketer but now I am learning to take time off, and I must say I am enjoying myself at\nhome. Cricket allowed us to have a place of our own, our current bungalow in Bandra West, and Anjali\nand I have taken care to ensure every little thing has been handpicked by us. From growing up as a\nchild in a one-room place next to Shivaji Park, to sleeping in our living room with Ajit till , to\nfinally owning a bungalow in Bandra \u2013 by being true to cricket I have been able to fulfil a lifelong\ndream of owning my own house.\nSomething else I always wanted was to have my parents stay with me, and while my dream of\nhaving my father to stay at my own place was not fulfilled \u2013 he passed away in , and we moved\ninto our apartment in La Mer in  \u2013 my mother now stays with me, giving me immense fulfilment\nand pride. In fact, on  September , the day we moved into our bungalow in Bandra West, I took\nmy mother to the bungalow at six in the morning and showed her around the whole house in her\nwheelchair. I had driven her in a small car to avoid attention and wheeled her in her chair myself for\n\n\fthe entire time. She was actually the first person to enter the house, which made the occasion all the\nmore joyous.\nAs I start my second innings, I will do exactly what I did when I was eleven, live and enjoy each\nmoment. I don\u2019t know where my life is heading, nor do I want to predict anything. I will just take\nthings as they come, as I did when I played my first innings. There is one difference, however. As I\nmove on in life I will always live with the satisfaction that I managed to play the first innings my way,\nand have been able to leave behind a legacy I can now look back on with pride.\n\n\fAppendix\nFAREWELL SPEECH\n\nAll my friends \u2026 settle down, let me talk, I will get more and more emotional \u2026 my life, between \nyards for twenty-four years, it\u2019s hard to believe that that wonderful journey is coming to an end, but I\nwould like to take this opportunity to thank people who\u2019ve played an important role in my life. Also,\nfor the first time in my life I am carrying this list, to remember all the names in case I forget\nsomeone. I hope you understand \u2026 it\u2019s getting a little difficult to talk, but I\u2019ll manage.\nThe most, the most important person in my life, and I have missed him a lot since  when he\npassed away, my father. Without \u2026 without his guidance, I don\u2019t think I would have been standing\nhere in front of you. He gave me freedom at the age of eleven and told me \u2018Chase your dreams, but\nmake sure you don\u2019t find short cuts. The path might be difficult, but don\u2019t give up.\u2019 And I have simply\nfollowed his instructions. Above all, he told me to be a nice human being, which I will continue to do\nso, I have tried my best. Every time, every time I have done something special, whenever I\u2019ve showed\nmy bat, it was for my father, so I miss him today.\nMy mother, I don\u2019t know how she dealt with such a naughty child like me. I was not easy to\nmanage. She must be extremely patient. For a mother, the most important thing is that her child\nremains safe and healthy and fit, and that\u2019s what she was most bothered about and worried about. She,\nshe took care of me \u2026 for the last twenty-four years that I have played for India, but even before that,\nshe started praying for me the day I started playing cricket. She just prayed and prayed and prayed,\nand I think her prayers and blessings have given me the strength to go out and perform, so a big thank\nyou to my mother for all the sacrifices.\nIn my schooldays, for four years I stayed with my uncle and my aunt, because my school was quite\nfar from my home, and they treated me like their son. My aunt \u2013 after having had a hard day\u2019s play, I\nwould be half asleep and she would be feeding me food so that I could go and play again tomorrow. I\ncan\u2019t forget these moments. I am like their son and I am glad that it has continued to be the same way.\nMy eldest brother, Nitin, and his family have always encouraged me. My eldest brother doesn\u2019t like\nto talk much, but the one thing he always told me is, \u2018Whatever you do, I know you will give a\nhundred per cent, and I have full confidence and faith in you.\u2019 His encouragement meant a lot to me.\nMy sister, Savita, and her family, was no different. The first cricket bat of my life was presented to me\nby my sister, it was a Kashmir willow bat \u2026 but that is where the journey began. She is one of those\nmany who still continue to fast when I bat, so thank you very much.\nAjit, my brother, now what do I talk about him? I don\u2019t know, really. We\u2019ve, we\u2019ve lived this dream\ntogether. He was the one who sacrificed his career for my cricket. He spotted the spark in me. And it\nall started from the age of eleven when he took me to Achrekar Sir, my coach, and from there on my\nlife changed. You will find this hard to believe that even last night he called me and we were\ndiscussing my dismissal, knowing that there was a remote chance of batting again, but just that, the\nhabit which we have developed and the rapport that we have developed, since my birth, it has\n\n\fcontinued and it will continue. Maybe even when I\u2019m not playing cricket we will still be discussing\ntechnique. Various things, various things we agreed upon, my technique, and so many technical things\nwhich I didn\u2019t agree with him, we have had arguments and disagreements, but in the end when I look\nback at all those things, if that hadn\u2019t happened in my life, I would have been a lesser cricketer.\nThe most beautiful thing happened to me in  when I met my wife, Anjali. Those were, those\nwere special years and it has continued and it will always continue that way. I know, I know Anjali,\nbeing a doctor, there was a wonderful career in front of her. When we decided to have a family, Anjali\ntook the initiative to step back and say that, \u2018You continue with your cricket and I\u2019ll take the\nresponsibility of the family.\u2019 Without, without that, I don\u2019t think I would have been able to play\ncricket freely and without any stress. Thanks for bearing up, bearing with all my fuss, all my\nfrustrations and all sorts of rubbish that I have spoken \u2013 I normally do. Thanks for bearing with me\nand always staying by my side through the ups and downs. You are the best partnership I\u2019ve had in my\nlife.\nThen, then the two precious diamonds of my life, Sara and Arjun. They have already grown up. You\nknow, my daughter is sixteen, my son is fourteen. Time has flown by. I wanted to spend so much time\nwith them on special occasions like their birthdays, their annual days, sports day, going on holidays,\nwhatever. I have missed out on all those things. Thanks for your understanding. Both of you \u2026 have\nbeen so, so special to me \u2026 you cannot imagine. I promise you, I promise you, for fourteen years and\nsixteen years I have not spent enough time with both of you, but the next, the next sixteen years or\neven beyond that, everything is for you.\nMy, my in-laws, Anand Mehta and Annabel, both have been so, so supportive, loving, caring \u2026 I\nhave discussed on various, various things in life, generally with them, and taken their advice. You\nknow, it\u2019s so important to have a strong family who is always with you and guiding you. Before you\nstart clapping, the most important thing they did was allowing me to marry Anjali, so thank you very\nmuch.\nIn the last, in the last twenty-four years that I have played for India I have made new friends, and\nbefore that I have had friends from my childhood. They all have had a terrific contribution. Right\nfrom, you know, as and when I have called them to come and bowl to me in the nets, they have left all\ntheir work aside and come and helped me. Be it joining me on holidays and having discussions on\ncricket, when I was a little stressed and wanting to find a solution so that I could perform better \u2013 all\nthose moments, my friends were with me. Even for whenever I was injured, I would wake up in the\nmorning because I could not sleep, I thought my career was over because of injuries, that\u2019s when my\nfriends have woken up at three o\u2019clock in the morning to drive with me and just make me believe that\n\u2018Your career is not over.\u2019 Life \u2026 would be incomplete without all those friends. Thanks for being\nthere for me.\nMy cricket career started when I was eleven. The turning point of my career was when my brother\ntook me to Achrekar Sir, my coach. I was extremely delighted to see him up in the stands. Normally\nhe sits in front of the television and he watches all the games that I play. When I was \u2026 when I was\neleven/twelve, those, those were the days where I used to hop back on his scooter and play a couple of\npractice matches a day. You know, first half of the innings I would be batting on Shivaji Park, the\nsecond half some other match at Azad Maidan. Sir would be taking me all over Mumbai to make sure\nthat I got match practice.\nOn a lighter note, in the last twenty-nine years Sir has never ever said \u2018well played\u2019 to me because\nhe thought I would get complacent and I would stop working hard. Maybe he can, he can push his luck\nand wish me now \u2018well done\u2019 on my career, and because there are no more matches, sir, in my life. I\n\n\fwill be witnessing cricket, and cricket will always stay in my heart, but you had an immense\ncontribution in my life, so thank you very much.\nMy cricket for Mumbai started right here on this ground, the Mumbai Cricket Association, which is\nso dear to me. I remember landing from New Zealand at four o\u2019clock in the morning and turning up\nfor a game at eight o\u2019clock here, just because I wanted to be part of Mumbai cricket, not that anyone\nforced me or Mumbai Cricket Association pressurized me to be here, but that was for the love of\nMumbai cricket. And thank you very much \u2013 the president is here \u2013 thank you very much, along with\nyour team, for taking care of me and looking after my cricket.\nThe dream was obviously to, to play for India, and that\u2019s where my association with BCCI started.\nBCCI was fantastic, right from the, from my debut. Believing in my ability, selecting me in the squad\nat the age of sixteen was, was a big step. So thanks to all the selectors for having, having faith in me\nand the BCCI for giving me the freedom to express myself out in the middle. Things would have been\ndifferent if you had not been behind me, and I really appreciate your support. Especially when I was\ninjured, you were right with me and making sure that all the treatments were taken care of and I got fit\nand fine, playing back for India.\nThe journey has been special, the last twenty-four years. I have played with many, many senior\ncricketers, and even before that there were many senior cricketers whom I watched on television \u2013\nthey inspired me to play cricket and play it the right way. Thanks so much to all those senior\ncricketers. Unfortunately I have not been able to play with them, but I have high regards for all their\nachievements and all their contributions.\nWe see it on the mega-screen, Rahul, Laxman, Sourav \u2013 Anil is not here \u2013 and my team-mates right\nhere in front of me. You are, you are like my family away from home. I have had some wonderful\ntimes with you \u2026 it\u2019s going to be difficult not to be part of the dressing room, sharing those special\nmoments. All the coaches, for, for their guidance, it has been special for me. I know when MS Dhoni\npresented me the th Test match cap on day one morning, I had a brief message for the team. I\nwould like to repeat that: I just feel that all of us are so, so fortunate and proud to be part of the Indian\ncricket team, serving the nation. Knowing all of you guys, I know you will continue to serve the nation\nin the right spirit and the right values. I believe, I believe we have been the lucky ones to have been\nchosen by the Almighty to serve this wonderful sport. Each generation gets this opportunity to merely\ntake care of this sport and serve it to the best of our ability. I have full faith in you that you\u2019ll continue\nto serve the nation in the right spirit, to the best of your ability, and bring all the laurels to our\ncountry. All the very best.\nI would be failing in my duties if I didn\u2019t thank all the doctors, the physios, the trainers, who\u2019ve put\nthis difficult body together to go back on the field and to be able to play. The amount of injuries that\nI\u2019ve had in my career, I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve managed to keep me fit, but without your special\nefforts, it would never have happened. I mean, the doctors have met me at weird hours. I mean, I have\ncalled them from Mumbai to Chennai, Mumbai to Delhi, wherever, and then they have just taken the\nnext flight and they\u2019ve left their work and they\u2019ve come, they\u2019ve treated me, which has allowed me to\nplay. So a big thank you to all three of you for keeping me in good shape.\nMy dear friend, late Mark Mascarenhas, my first manager \u2013 we unfortunately lost him in a car\naccident in , but he was such a well-wisher of cricket, my cricket, especially Indian cricket. He\nwas so passionate. He understood what it takes to represent a nation and gave me all the space to go\nout and express myself, and never pressurized me to do this ad or promotion, whatever the sponsors\ndemanded. He took care of that and today I miss him, so thank you, Mark, for all your contribution.\nMy current, my current management team, WSG, for, for repeating what Mark has done, because\n\n\fwhen we signed the contract I exactly told them what I want from them and what it requires to be\nrepresenting India. They have understood that and respected that, so thank you very much, WSG.\nSomeone who has worked closely with me for fourteen years is my manager, Vinod Naidu. He is\nmore like my family and all the sacrifices, spending time away from his family for my work, has been\nspecial, so a big thank you to your family as well, for giving so much time for my work with Vinod.\nIn my schooldays, when I performed well, the media backed me a lot. You continue to do that till\nthis morning. Thank you so much to all the media, for supporting me and appreciating my\nperformances. It surely had a positive effect on me. Thank you so much to all the photographers as\nwell, for those wonderful captured moments will stay with me for the rest of my life, so to all the\nphotographers a big thank you.\nI know my speech is getting a bit too long, but this is the last thing I want to say \u2026 I want to \u2026 I\nwant to thank all the people here who\u2019ve flown in from various parts of the world and supported me\nendlessly, whether I scored a zero or I scored a hundred-plus, whatever. Your support was so dear to\nme and it meant a lot to me.\nWhatever you\u2019ve done for me \u2013 I know I\u2019ve met so many guys who\u2019ve fasted for me, prayed for me,\ndone all sorts of things for me \u2013 you know, without all that, life wouldn\u2019t have been like this for me. I\nwant to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and also say that time has flown by rather quickly, but\nthe memories that you have left with me will always be with me for ever and ever, especially \u2018Sachin,\nSachin\u2019. That will reverberate in my ears \u2026 till I stop breathing.\nThank you very much. If I\u2019ve, if I\u2019ve missed out on saying something, missed out on a few names, I\nhope you understand. Goodbye.\nWankhede Stadium, Mumbai\n November \n THE BEST SERIES EVER\n\nIndia started well under Sourav, winning the ODI series \u2013 against South Africa in March . But\nsoon afterwards cricket plummeted to a low in the wake of the match-fixing scandal. The credibility\nof the game had been compromised and I found the revelations about matches being thrown for money\ndistasteful and disgusting. The whole thing was repulsive and what was seriously worrying was that\nfans had started to lose faith and the integrity of our sport was in doubt. We desperately needed to\nbring credibility back to the game and we hoped that we could do so in the course of playing the\nAustralians at home in a much-anticipated Test series in February\u2013March . It would allow fans to\nmove away from the sordid tales of corruption and focus on the real thing: quality Test cricket.\nAt the time, Steve Waugh\u2019s Australian team were hammering opposition teams both at home and\naway. They had won fifteen Test matches in a row when they landed in India. In Glenn McGrath,\nJason Gillespie, Damien Fleming, Michael Kasprowicz and Shane Warne they had a bowling line-up\ncapable of taking wickets in all conditions. The batting was also exceptional, with Matthew Hayden,\nMichael Slater, Justin Langer, the Waugh twins, Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist all in good form.\nA few months before the Australia series my family had relocated from Sahitya Sahawas to our new\nhaven, an apartment at La Mer Residency in Mumbai\u2019s Bandra West, a move to which I contributed\nvery little, I have to confess. It was Anjali who organized everything and all I did was walk into a\nsprawling apartment with all my things beautifully set up for me.\nOn the morning of  January , just ten months after we had moved into the new apartment, I\nheard Anjali screaming in fear, yelling \u2018Earthquake!\u2019 The building was swaying from side to side and\nmy first thought was that the builder must have messed up with the construction. However, within\nmoments I realized that it was far more serious than that and people from nearby buildings were all\nscreaming \u2018Bhago, bhago!\u2019 (Run, run!) Because we were on the tenth and eleventh floors, it would\nhave taken us a few minutes to walk down with two kids, so all we did was stand in the middle of the\ndrawing room, huddled together as a family, praying for the catastrophe to stop.\nThe earthquake that rocked Western India lasted less than a minute, but it left devastation in its\nwake. The town of Bhuj in Gujarat was almost destroyed and we in Mumbai did not escape unscathed.\nFrom my bedroom at La Mer I could see Mount Mary Church on the one side and Siddhivinayak\nTemple on the other and for days after the earthquake I would pray at night, urging God never to\nunleash such wrath on us again.\nIn fact, even when I played a Duleep Trophy match in Pune for West Zone against East Zone in\nearly February, I still could not sleep properly at night. The nightmare of the quake was too fresh to\nforget. In Pune we were staying in an ordinary hotel but the staff did everything possible to make\nthings comfortable for me. In fact, they overdid things on occasions and were themselves embarrassed\nas a result. To ensure we all had hot water, the maintenance person had switched on the boiler very\nearly in the morning. As a result, the boiler overheated and all we ended up with was black muddy\n\n\fwater in the room. Being used to staying in five-star hotels, initially I was irritated with the hotel staff,\nbut later I found it funny that they were trying so hard to make me comfortable. The effort was\noverwhelming and left a lasting impression.\nSoon after the end of the Duleep Trophy game, in which I scored  in our only innings, a number\nof journalists asked me if we stood a chance against Australia. I said we did and felt confident we\ncould beat them, provided we were able to put them under pressure. It seemed to me they weren\u2019t\naccustomed to handling pressure and it would be interesting to see how they reacted if we gained the\nupper hand.\n\nFirst Test, Mumbai,  February\u2013 March \nThough we lost the first Test in Mumbai in three days, we did have our moments in the match. I\nscored  in the first innings, getting out when I went for an expansive shot to a McGrath delivery that\nwas wide of off stump. In the Australian first innings we reduced them to \u2013, with Harbhajan Singh\ntaking three quick wickets, before an aggressive counter-attacking partnership between Hayden and\nGilchrist took the match away from us again. We dropped a few catches and they both managed to\nscore hundreds, giving Australia a sizeable first-innings lead.\nWe started the second innings with thirty overs remaining in the second day and had lost two\nwickets by the time we came to the last over. Then the nightwatchman Nayan Mongia was hit on the\nfinger by a ball from Gillespie and retired hurt. I had to go in and play out the last five balls, a task\nthat is never easy, particularly with Gillespie bowling at his best. The next morning I resumed with\nRahul Dravid, knowing it was going to be a stern test of our character. McGrath and Gillespie were\nbowling in tandem and while Rahul mostly played Gillespie, I played out a very good spell from\nMcGrath. We hardly rotated strike, knowing that once we had played out the initial burst from these\ntwo bowlers, things would become a lot easier.\nI scored a half-century but I think even my harshest critic would concede that I got out in a most\nunfortunate manner. I played a full-blooded pull shot to a short Mark Waugh delivery, which would\nhave been a definite boundary had the ball not hit Justin Langer\u2019s back at forward short leg and\nspooned up to midwicket. Ricky Ponting ran fifteen yards and dived forward for a very good catch.\nThe momentum had shifted and Australia soon capitalized on the advantage and closed out the game.\nThe Australians had now won sixteen straight Tests and needed to win just one more to set a new\nworld record.\n\nSecond Test, Kolkata, \u2013 March \nThe Kolkata Test match was undoubtedly one of the best I played in, but it didn\u2019t start well for us.\nAustralia scored  in the first innings, thanks to  from Steve Waugh and  from Matthew\nHayden, and when we were at a dismal \u2013 at the end of day two, with the Australian quartet of\nMcGrath, Gillespie, Kasprowicz and Warne all taking wickets, not even the most ardent Indian fan\nthought we\u2019d be able to save the match. I had scored ten in our first innings and everybody was\ndejected after our frankly pathetic batting display. John Wright, our coach, was livid and took it out on\na few plastic bottles in the dressing room.\nThe poor performance hurt even more because it followed the high of the first ever Indian hat-trick\nin Test cricket. Harbhajan had picked up Ponting, Gilchrist and Warne in succession on the first day,\nswinging the match in our favour again after Australia had reached a position of strength at \u2013.\n\n\fBhajji was brilliant throughout the series and this was the very best I had ever seen him bowl. First he\nhad Ponting lbw, then he followed up with the wicket of Adam Gilchrist. Understandably there was a\nlot of talk among the players before the hat-trick ball and I had an urge to tell Bhajji what I thought he\nshould bowl to Warne, the new batsman. However, I decided not to and all I said was that he should\nbowl what he thought best. He ended up bowling a low full toss, which Warne played into the hands of\nforward short leg.\nAt the end of our first innings on the third morning at Eden Gardens, even though we failed to avoid\nthe follow-on, there were signs of better things for us when Laxman, batting at six, managed to add a\nfew runs with the tail. He scored  and was the last man out. There was a brief discussion in the\ndressing room and we all agreed that Laxman, who was obviously in good touch, should go in at three\nfor the second innings, with Rahul moving to six. None of us had any idea that this swap would result\nin history being written.\nLaxman and Rahul batted like champions in the second innings and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing an\nextraordinary batting effort unfold before my eyes. India scored  runs in the second innings on day\nfour without losing a single wicket. Not to lose a wicket in a day is unbelievable and to do it against\nthe world\u2019s best team makes the achievement all the more miraculous. Laxman played some\nunbelievable shots off Warne and both he and Rahul had to battle serious physical exhaustion in the\nintense heat and humidity, but they held on, eventually scoring  and  respectively, and by the\nend of the day we knew we couldn\u2019t lose the Test match. In fact, we had started to believe that we had\na slim chance of winning if we bowled well on the last day. This in itself was a dramatic turnaround,\nbecause for the first time in the series we had managed to put Australia under pressure, just as I\u2019d\nhoped.\nWe declared early on day five with a lead of  and knew we had a chance if we could force the\nAustralians back with a few quick wickets. Harbhajan was bowling with exceptional skill, but we\nneeded someone to back him up from the other end. We did not get the wickets we were after in the\npost-lunch session, however, and Australia went to tea with just three down. The game was drifting\ntowards a draw unless something dramatic happened.\nWanting to try something different, Sourav decided to give my bowling a go. He hoped that a\ncouple of breakthroughs might open up the game and he knew that the large Kolkata crowd would get\nbehind us if they sensed an opportunity. I would always bowl for two or three overs when there were\npartnerships, and being an irregular bowler, I had licence to experiment. On the fifth-day pitch I\ndecided to bowl leg-spin, pitching the ball in the rough with two left-handers at the crease. It was one\nof those rare days when the ball came out perfectly and I managed to take three quick wickets for the\nteam in a five-over spell, including the wickets of in-form Matthew Hayden and the dangerous Adam\nGilchrist.\nHowever, the wicket that gave me the most satisfaction was that of Shane Warne. I tried to bowl\nhim a googly and the ball ended up being a half-tracker, landing in the middle of the pitch before\nturning in to hit Warne plumb in front. Warne had perhaps misread the delivery and had first tried to\ncut before playing a half-pull. I had bamboozled one of the great spinners of all time!\nWe now had the opening we were after and Bhajji did the rest. When we finally took the last wicket\nof Glenn McGrath, with just three overs or so remaining in the match, the stadium went mad. Close to\n, spectators at Eden Gardens could not believe we had managed to win \u2013 and it was only the\nthird time in history that a team had won after following on.\nWe celebrated for a long time after the match. The atmosphere in the changing room had changed\ncompletely after such an incredible win. There was a tremendous sense of positivity and we started to\n\n\fbelieve that we could go on to win the series. The Australians had collapsed in the face of sustained\npressure. The myth of invincibility had been shattered. The series was now locked at \u2013, with all to\nplay for in the third and final Test at Chennai.\nThe impact of the victory, celebrated all across the country, is perhaps illustrated by an incident\ninvolving SK Bansal, one of the umpires officiating in the Test. Mr Bansal later recounted to me that\nhe had gone out for a meal after the match and his driver had mistakenly taken a wrong turn. He was\nheading the wrong way up a one-way street and was soon stopped by a traffic constable. Mr Bansal,\ndreading the consequences the driver would be subjected to, stepped out of the car to ask the constable\nto forgive the poor fellow. The constable, who turned out to be an ardent cricket fan, recognized Mr\nBansal and promptly decided to let the driver off.\n\nThird Test, Chennai, \u2013 March \nThe Australians started well, with Matthew Hayden once again leading the way. He had batted\nwonderfully throughout the series and was the only Australian batsman who looked comfortable\nagainst Harbhajan. He scored an impressive double hundred and the Australians notched up a firstinnings score of . I bowled a good spell on the first day, carrying on from Kolkata, and got the ball\nto turn sharply but did not take any wickets, but by the end of the spell, the skin of my fingers had\nstarted to peel off and I was finding it hard to grip the ball.\nAustralia, who were at \u2013 at the end of day one, suffered a collapse on day two, ending up with\njust . It all started with an unusual dismissal. Against skipper Steve Waugh we were trying to keep\nthings tight and when he tried taking a single to short cover I prevented the run and said a few things\nto him on the lines that he was trying to get away from the strike. Rahul, fielding at leg slip, offered a\nfew words and before long we were able to get under Waugh\u2019s skin. Finally, when Harbhajan beat him\nwith a good off-spinner and appealed for lbw, Waugh, in a momentary lapse of concentration, moved\nthe ball away with his hand. We appealed for handling the ball, and the Australian captain was on his\nway back to the dressing room. Mission accomplished, we didn\u2019t say another word to him.\nI was determined to make amends for my batting failures in Kolkata and had practised hard against\nreverse swing in the gap between the two Test matches. I decided to follow the ball throughout my\ninnings and not to lose sight of it at any time. To play well against reverse swing you have to keep\nyour eye on the ball for as long as possible and that was what I did all day, as it was passed from the\nwicketkeeper to the slips and through the hands of various fielders back to the bowler. I focused on the\nball and nothing else. The only time I was not following the ball was when I was talking to the nonstriker about something. As the bowler came in to bowl I concentrated on the ball and monitored the\nrelease as closely as possible. From the arm position and the release point I could assess what was\ncoming at me and I tried to play as late as possible.\nThis exercise was draining and by the end of the day I was mentally exhausted. However, I had done\nwhat the team needed me to do: I had scored a hundred. I had forged an important partnership with\nRahul, which was all the more satisfying because we had to negotiate a very hostile Jason Gillespie\nspell with the second new ball. Gillespie, who was tired after bowling all day, wasn\u2019t bowling quite so\nfast with the second new ball, but suddenly he gained inspiration from an unlikely source. One solitary\nAustralian fan, sitting at the top of the sightscreen and carrying a huge toy kangaroo, started\nscreaming after every delivery, urging Gillespie on. He was shouting \u2018Come on Aussie\u2019 each time he\nwalked back to the end of his run-up. The fan had a huge impact on him. Within minutes Gillespie\nstarted to bowl really quickly again and was all fired up. Rahul and I even discussed what had\n\n\fhappened to him all of a sudden. It just goes to show that you don\u2019t always need thousands of fans to\nmotivate you.\nOur partnership of  helped the team to an important -run lead, giving our bowlers some runs\nto play with in the second innings. The match was nicely poised in our favour and we knew we had a\nchance to close out the series. Hayden was once again going to be the crucial wicket. He fell for  to\nthe bowling of Nilesh Kulkarni. Gilchrist was the other danger man lower down the order, because we\nknew he could score quickly and put the pressure back on us. But Bhajji, who had a grip on Gilchrist\nand Ponting right through the series, once again took the bulk of the Australian wickets, finishing off\nwith a career-best haul of \u2013 in the innings. We needed  runs to win the series.\nThe chase started well and we were cruising before Mark Waugh pulled off an unbelievable catch at\nshort midwicket. It was a full-blooded pull shot from VVS Laxman and Waugh just flung himself at\nfull stretch to come up with a stunning catch. Laxman had been batting brilliantly for his  and his\ndismissal left us at \u2013, changing the course of the match yet again. Suddenly we had a contest on\nour hands.\nBy this stage, the whole team was sitting nervously outside the changing room. Everyone was told\nnot to change seating positions and we were all feeling the tension. There were not too many runs left\nto get, but at stake was a series win against the world\u2019s best cricket team. The crowd was cheering\nevery Indian run. It could not get any bigger.\nAt a crucial time, Harbhajan Singh and Sameer Dighe, our wicketkeeper and my very close friend,\nput together a partnership that, though not a big one, was perhaps the most significant of the series.\nFighting unbelievable pressure, they somehow held things together to take us over the line and the rest\nof the team were in raptures. The way the two of them ran the winning runs was almost comical, but it\nwas an incredible feeling to know we had won the match and the series. We were all shouting with\ndelight and handing out high-fives and hugs. We had beaten the best team in the world and it felt truly\namazing to have accomplished what I had predicted before the start of the contest. We had put the\nAustralians under pressure and had reaped the rewards for doing so. The whole team had stuck\ntogether despite losing the first Test, and this series is without doubt one of the best I have played in\nmy career.\nComing at a critical time, the series also helped restore Indian fans\u2019 faith in the game. Cricket had\nonce again triumphed over all odds. Both teams had played hard cricket and the passion and intensity\nwas at a high level throughout. Played before huge crowds, it was the best possible advertisement for\nTest cricket. To Australia\u2019s credit, they were always competitive and had actually come close to\nwinning in Chennai themselves, picking up eight Indian wickets in the second innings.\nAs we celebrated the series win I remember being very pleased to see Anil, who had not played a\npart in the series because of injury. He had been present in the pre-series training camp and had come\nalong to cheer on the team during the third and deciding Test.\nDuring the ODI series that followed, which we lost \u2013, I reached , runs in ODIs, in the third\ngame in Indore, and in the last match in Goa I did something that I have never done again in my life. I\ninjured my index finger and ended up bowling off-spin with my middle finger for ten overs, picking\nup \u2013 in the spell, including the wicket of Steve Waugh. The moment Waugh came in to bat I\nstarted gesturing towards the midwicket fielder, suggesting to Waugh that I would get him out there. It\nwas friendly banter and Waugh retorted by saying I wasn\u2019t playing in my garden. As luck would have\nit, Steve tried playing a slog sweep to midwicket and was caught there by Ajit Agarkar.\nAustralia in India  \u2013 The Border-Gavaskar Trophy\n\n\fst Test. Mumbai.

I had trained hard in the off season and felt in good shape ahead of the series.\nFor close to two years, between August  and July , I had been injury-free and the off-season\ntraining had definitely helped improve my fitness. I used to run in the mornings and do gym sessions\nin the afternoon to strengthen my upper body and I also kept a check on my diet. The discipline had\nhelped and the  back injury was now just a bad memory.\nI started the tournament in red-hot form and scored two fifties and a century in the four pool games,\nbeing dismissed only once. But just as I had started to look forward to the final, I suffered the second\nmajor injury of my career in rather unexpected circumstances.\nIt happened during the last of our group matches against the West Indies on  July . Rahul and\nI were batting together and we were cruising to victory. With some  runs left to win, I turned a ball\nto midwicket and set off for two runs. That\u2019s when I heard something click in my big toe. Immediately\nI felt a sense of discomfort and found it difficult to complete the second run. Before the next ball I\nwalked up to Rahul and said that I had hurt my toe and that the temperature in my foot had suddenly\ngone up a few degrees. However, with so few runs needed, I decided to stay in and finish off the game\nas quickly as possible, making  in the process.\nAfter the match I showed the toe to Andrew Leipus, who had taken over as our physiotherapist, and\nthe next morning we went for an X-ray. The pain had actually increased in the interim and I was now\nstruggling to walk properly. On our way to the hospital I asked Andrew not to tell me about the results\nof the X-ray, for no matter what, I wanted to play in the final. Soon after the X-ray, Andrew, looking\nsomewhat helpless, just said to me, \u2018You are a crazy man.\u2019\nBefore the game it was decided that Andrew would strap the toe bent down to prevent any\nmovement and I took the field against the West Indies in considerable physical discomfort. I had been\nin terrific touch throughout the tournament and the thinking was that my batting was more important\nfor the team than my fielding and bowling. Personally, I felt I would be able to make it through the\ngame, as it happened to be the final match. After all that effort, however, I proceeded to get out for a\nduck and we lost the match. It turned out I had damaged my sesamoid bone, which is the bone at the\nconnection of the big toe and the first metatarsal.\nAfter returning to India I was prescribed total rest, but after two months I still wasn\u2019t happy with\nthe way the recovery was going. I could barely walk without discomfort. In desperation I saw a\nspecialist, who advised me to have surgery. We even fixed a tentative date, but that\u2019s when Anjali\nadvised me to seek a second opinion. She felt that surgery should always be the last resort and we had\nto be sure there was no other way to get the injury treated.\nWe went to the Bombay hospital and saw one of the most senior doctors around, Dr Dholakia. He\nshowed me a big fat book on sesamoid bones and informed me that the author of the book, who was\n\n\fthe world expert on sesamoid injuries, wasn\u2019t a hundred per cent certain that surgery was the best way\nto treat them. He went on to say that I shouldn\u2019t allow anyone to touch my toe, as it might be\ncounterproductive. There was the possibility of permanent damage, which might bring my career to an\nend, and that was a scary thought. On the very same day Dr Dholakia started looking into where I\ncould go to get my toe examined by a specialist.\nEventually I found myself at the Rosebank Clinic in Johannesburg, where Dr Mark Ferguson, who\nhad worked with a lot of sportsmen, advised me to try out a few insoles. Over a week in South Africa I\nwent from walking for fifteen minutes to close to an hour. Back in Mumbai I continued with the\nroutine, building up from jogging to running. Running in cricket shoes was a bit of a problem because\nof the spikes, so for the next few months I wore shoes with no spikes immediately under my toes. The\ninjury, it appeared, was finally on the mend.\nMy first tour after the lay-off, coincidentally perhaps, was to South Africa in October\u2013November\n. We were playing a tri-series against South Africa and Kenya before going on to play a threeTest series against the South Africans. However, in our very first tour game against the Nicky\nOppenheimer XI on  October, the pain in my toe resurfaced. It was a strange sensation and I left the\nfield to get some treatment.\nLuckily for me we were in Randjesfontein, which is not far from Johannesburg, so I set out for the\nRosebank Clinic again. Much to my relief, I was assured there that it wasn\u2019t anything major and that a\nslight recurrence of pain was normal with sesamoid bone injuries. They told me that there was no need\nto panic. I left the clinic with a sigh of relief and was eager to get back to playing cricket again.\nThe first match of the tri-series was in Johannesburg on  October and I managed to score a hundred\nagainst South Africa. The intensity of the match pushed the thought of the injury out of my mind, but\nafterwards I was relieved that I\u2019d been able to bat for so long with very little pain. It was as if I had\nstarted all over again.\n\nIndia in South Africa, November \nTaking on South Africa in their home conditions is always challenging and it was even more so having\njust recovered from the toe injury. I had, however, started to feel more confident after a net session at\nBloemfontein, the venue for the first of the three Tests. I distinctly remember that session because\nevery ball hit the middle of my bat and it seemed to me that I could do no wrong.\nThe first Test started on  November and happily my touch with the bat was still there in the first\ninnings. I made  out of a team total of , and it was the first time I played the upper cut over the\nslips, a shot I went on to use regularly in the second half of my career. I had come up with the idea of\nthe shot to counter the South African fast bowler Makhaya Ntini, whose strength was to bring the ball\nin to the batsman from short of a length. I knew that if I played the upper cut against Ntini, it would\naffect his rhythm, as he was not prepared for this form of counter-attack. The pitch in Bloemfontein\nhad a lot of bounce and in the absence of a third-man fielder the upper cut was a scoring stroke played\nwith minimal risk. I followed the ball till late and just helped it on the way over the slip fielders, using\nthe pace generated by Ntini.\nVirender Sehwag, on his debut, also played aggressively and, had we batted a little better in the\nsecond innings, we could have saved the game. Instead, we lost by nine wickets, with Shaun Pollock\ntaking \u2013. My partnership with Sehwag was our high point and I remember asking him if he was\nnervous when he walked out to bat for the first time in a Test. He admitted that he was a little and I\nimmediately told him that was normal. In fact, it was good to be a little nervous and everyone who\n\n\fplayed Test cricket experienced similar nerves. He just needed to play his natural game and the\nnervousness would disappear once he\u2019d spent a little time out in the middle. He did so and scored a\nfantastic hundred on debut.\n\nMissing the comforts of home\nWe went to Port Elizabeth for the second Test. Sara and Arjun were both with me and on one evening\nbefore the match I asked the hotel staff to recommend a restaurant where we could go out for a good\nfamily meal. Eating together was the only way I could spend quality time with my children and I\nlooked forward to these meals at the end of long, hard work days. The hotel staff told me about a diner\nthat also had a fairly big play area where the children could enjoy themselves and we ended up going\nto the same restaurant three days in a row. It was from this restaurant that I picked up the idea of the\nplay area that I put in my own restaurant when I opened Tendulkar\u2019s in Mumbai in .\nFood on tour was always an important consideration for the team and to get the kind of food we\nliked in places such as Bulawayo in Zimbabwe and some South African cities could sometimes be a\nreal problem.\nI remember one occasion in Bulawayo when all the players were yearning for home food. We were\ntired of eating the same breakfast and lunch in the hotel, and the restaurants were not the best.\nSpotting an Indian family that had come to see us play, Sameer Dighe boldly walked up to them and\nsaid that the team was desperate to eat some good Indian food \u2013 could they help?\nJhanak bhai, the man in question, was a Gujarati settled in Zimbabwe and he ended up inviting the\nteam to his home, where we feasted on a home-cooked meal of Gujarati-style dal, rice and ghee. We\nall had three spoons of ghee and pigged out on the food in front of us. It soon became a regular thing\nand Jhanak bhai and his family fed us many times. Others who have been kind enough to provide us\nwith good home-cooked food in Zimbabwe and South Africa are Raj and Chester Naik and Jayesh\nDesai. They have selflessly helped us whenever we have toured their parts of the world and have made\na major contribution to our well-being. Raj and Chester Naik also took us to play golf and we had\nsome wonderful dinners together. Invariably Ravi Shastri would join us for these dinners because they\nwere his friends first. I became good friends with many of them and must say I will always remember\nthe warmth and affection I received from them and their families.\n\nUnacceptable allegations\nWe managed a better batting performance in the Port Elizabeth Test, which started on  November\n. Rahul Dravid and Deep Dasgupta, our wicketkeeper, played resolutely on the last day, and we\nsaved the match comfortably in the end. However, what hit the headlines from that match were the\nallegations made against me by the match referee Mike Denness, who also charged five other Indian\nplayers.\nThe incident occurred on the third day, when I bowled a four-over spell, taking the wicket of\nHerschelle Gibbs. I was bowling seam-up and was getting the ball to swing both ways. During this\nspell I used my thumb to clean off the grass that was stuck on the seam.\nSoon after the end of the day\u2019s play we were informed that the match referee had called six Indian\nplayers for a hearing and that I had been accused of ball tampering. I was shocked, because I had\nalways played cricket with integrity and honesty and would never do such a thing.\nWhen I met the match referee I informed him that I was merely trying to clean the seam of the ball.\n\n\fMy mistake, which I have no hesitation in owning up to, was that I should have informed the on-field\numpires under Law . when I was cleaning the seam, but I\u2019m afraid it did not enter my mind in the\nintensity of the moment. I asked Mike Denness to consult the on-field umpires, because they had\nchecked the ball every two or three overs and were in the best position to tell if the ball had been\ntampered with. Denness said that there was no need to consult the umpires, presumably because I had\nadmitted altering the ball by cleaning the seam.\nI found this strange, because there was no way Denness could gauge what was going on in the\nmiddle when he was sitting eighty yards away from the pitch. None of the umpires had lodged a\nformal complaint against me and it was humiliating to be labelled a cheat. I wasn\u2019t prepared to let it\npass. I informed Mike Denness that I would complain about the allegation to the BCCI and would not\nkeep quiet about it.\nApart from charging me with ball tampering, Mike Denness handed captain Sourav Ganguly a onematch suspended ban for failing to control the players and banned Virender Sehwag for one match on\na charge of over-appealing. Deep Dasgupta, Harbhajan Singh and Shiv Sunder Das, the opening\nbatsman, were all handed a one-Test suspended ban and fined  per cent of their match fee for the\nsame offence. The team considered these punishments harsh, especially when none of the South\nAfricans had been pulled up despite, we felt, appealing just as aggressively. It is a hard game and\nsometimes things get heated in the middle. But we didn\u2019t think we deserved the punishments we had\nbeen handed.\nWe informed the BCCI that the allegations were unsubstantiated and unfair. We were delighted\nwhen the BCCI, led by Jagmohan Dalmiya, stood steadfastly behind us and informed the ICC that the\nteam had lost faith in the match referee. We also received support in the media; the Indian journalistic\nfraternity, at home and on tour, was united behind the team. We were prepared to abandon the tour if\nneed be, but we weren\u2019t ready to be labelled cheats. It was about honour and there was no way we\nwould allow a match referee to cast aspersions on our credibility.\nThings had come to such a pass at one point that we weren\u2019t sure if the tour would actually carry on.\nThere were conflicting reports everywhere and the atmosphere was one of mistrust and confusion. The\nsituation came to a head twenty-four hours before the start of the third Test match, when it was finally\ndecided by the Indian and South African boards, rather than by the ICC, that Mike Denness should not\nofficiate in the match. Denis Lindsay, the former South African wicketkeeper, was the replacement,\nand the match went ahead, but it was labelled an unofficial Test match by the ICC.\nNot everything was right about it after all the acrimony, which I must say was largely unnecessary.\nMike Denness\u2019s decisions had led to a crisis that had ended up dividing the cricket world down the\nmiddle. It was an avoidable incident and one that left everyone bitter in the end.\nIndia in South Africa \nst Test.

Nasser, nowadays a respected commentator, played hard and came up with some\nultra-defensive tactics against me. It was in this series that Nasser instructed his left-arm spinner\nAshley Giles to bowl from over the wicket and consistently pitch the ball way outside my leg stump.\nNasser and Giles were counting on the fact that I would have limited scoring options off balls bowled\nthere and were hoping to frustrate me and induce me to play a false shot. They had essentially given\nup any attempt to get me out in favour of trying to get under my skin.\nWhile Giles did manage to have me stumped, for the first time in my Test career, in the third Test\nin Bangalore, overall these tactics had little impact on the result of the series. I scored a lot of runs in\nall three Test matches and was declared Player of the Series.\nI was reminded of this series when Nasser, who is a good friend, met me a couple of years later in\nSouth Africa during the  World Cup. We were in the washroom during the inaugural function and\nNasser jokingly started the conversation, saying, \u2018So I am in the washroom with the great Mr\nTendulkar.\u2019 It was a minute-long conversation and we were both enjoying ourselves. It was friendly\nbanter between two people who have great regard for each other. From memory, the conversation went\nsomething like this:\nNASSER: You have to agree that I was successful in stopping you and getting you frustrated during\nthe  England tour of India when I got Ashley Giles to bowl to you from over the wicket.\nSACHIN: You did indeed, but despite his efforts, my batting average for the series was , with\nscores of ,  and  in the three Test matches, and I was in fact nominated Player of the Series. I\nwould love to have that average right through my career.\nWe won the series \u2013, a result that gave us considerable confidence as we looked forward to the\nreturn tour of England the following summer. It looked likely to be an enthralling series.\n\nSome thoughts on batting\nIt was in the early stages of the  tour of England that I first gave a masterclass. It was at the Rose\nBowl, where we were playing a warm-up game against Hampshire, and it was organized by Mark\nNicholas for Channel  television. I enjoyed talking to a group of youngsters about the basics of\nbatting, including how to grip the bat.\nPeople have often commented on my own grip, which is very low down on the handle. It all goes\nback to when I started playing cricket when I was eleven with my brother Ajit, who is ten years older.\nAs I didn\u2019t have a bat of my own, I had to use Ajit\u2019s full-size bat and the only way I could cope with\nthe weight at that age was to hold the bat right at the bottom of the handle. Some coaches suggested\nchanging my grip, and I did experiment, but it never felt right. I had got used to feeling the end of the\n\n\fhandle pressing against the inside of my forearm and if I gripped the bat further up I didn\u2019t have that,\nand batting just didn\u2019t feel natural.\nThat\u2019s not to say that my technique didn\u2019t change at all, though. Throughout my career, I was\nalways looking to improve and constantly tried new things to cope with different situations. My\nbacklift changed significantly over the years, for example. I used a pretty heavy bat and I was\nsometimes encouraged to move to a lighter one. Again, I did try but I never felt comfortable, as my\nwhole bat swing depended on that weight. When I was hitting a drive, I needed the weight to generate\nthe power. It was all to do with the timing. To me the bat should be an extension of your arm, and if\nyou\u2019ve reached the stage where it\u2019s become an extension of your arm, why do you need to change?\nWhat mattered to me most when I was batting was feeling comfortable. As long as I felt\ncomfortable, it didn\u2019t matter where I was playing or who I was playing against. If you make technical\nadjustments, such as moving to a lighter bat, to cope with different conditions, there\u2019s a risk of\nmaking yourself feel uncomfortable and of thinking too much about your technique. I\u2019ve always felt\nthat I\u2019ve batted best when my mind has been at the bowler\u2019s end of the pitch, not at my end. In fact,\nfor both batsmen and bowlers, I\u2019ve always believed that cricket is played best when your mind is at\nthe opposite end and that problems occur when your mind is stuck at your own end.\nFor example, if a bowler is thinking too much about bowling no-balls, he\u2019s not going to be able to\nbowl what he wants to bowl. Instead, his mind should be at the batsman\u2019s end, focusing on where he\u2019s\ngoing to pitch the ball, which way he\u2019s going to swing it and so on. As a batsman, if I\u2019m not\nconsciously worrying about my footwork or my backlift or my wrist-work, then I know that I\u2019m in the\nright space, because my mind needs to be at the opposite end, figuring out what the bowler is trying to\ndo. There\u2019s no time to think about both ends at the same time. So in general it always seemed to me\nthat if I was comfortable with my gear, it would allow my mind to be at the opposite end and I had a\nbetter chance of playing well.\n\nIndia in England, the Test series, July\u2013September \nI have always enjoyed playing in England, but on the  tour it took the team a little time to adjust\nto the conditions. The first of the four Tests, at Lord\u2019s, started on  July  and England won pretty\nconvincingly, with Hussain making his highest score for five years and Michael Vaughan also\ncontributing a century. For India, the high point was my friend Ajit Agarkar\u2019s second-innings hundred,\nand I was delighted to see his name go up on the famous honours board in the dressing room.\nWe knew we needed to be more competitive in the next Test at Trent Bridge ten days later if we\nwere to stay alive in the four-match series. Once again England posted a huge score, with Vaughan\nagain in good form, and we were faced with batting out the last day to survive. The pitch was assisting\nthe bowlers and quite a few balls were taking off from a good length, while some were keeping low. In\ndifficult circumstances, Rahul and I put together an important partnership. There were occasions when\nwe were beaten by balls which had either taken off or kept low and all we did was smile. We chatted at\nthe end of every over but never once talked about the deliveries we had missed. It was natural that the\nball would occasionally beat us on a fifth-day wicket offering uneven bounce; we enjoyed the\nchallenge.\nRahul got a hundred and both Sourav and I fell in the nineties. Sourav was out for  while I was\nbowled for  by part-time off-spinner Michael Vaughan to what was probably the best ball he ever\nbowled. The ball pitched in the rough outside my off stump and turned a long way to go through the\ngap between bat and pad to hit the stumps. That we managed to hold on for a draw, thanks to some\n\n\fdour resistance from wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel, a teenager at the time, was an important statement\nand it laid the foundation for the fightback at Headingley in the third Test.\nThere was a long gap between the second and third Tests, which allowed us to unwind and refocus.\nBy now we had come to terms with the conditions and were feeling more relaxed. We were enjoying\nourselves socially, going out to interesting restaurants to try out different types of food and spending a\nlot of time together, which is always essential in the middle of a difficult tour.\nIt was around then that a friend of mine suggested visiting the famous Harry Ramsden\u2019s, in\nGuiseley in West Yorkshire. This restaurant, I was told, served great fish and chips and Ajit Agarkar\nand I decided to try out the fare. There was one item on the menu titled Harry\u2019s Challenge, which\ninvited the customer to eat a giant portion of fish, either cod or haddock, served with chips, bread and\nbutter and two other side dishes. If successful, the head chef would personally sign a certificate for the\ncustomer. I\u2019ve always been a big eater, so I decided to take on the challenge. I must say I managed the\ngiant portion of fish fairly comfortably and also polished off the salad and other side dishes served to\nme. The only thing I did not eat was the chips, which I thought might be just a little too fattening.\nImpressed with my performance, the chef signed my Harry\u2019s Challenge certificate all the same.\n\nThird Test, Headingley, \u2013 August \nThe wicket was very damp at the start of the Headingley Test on  August . Despite this, we\ndecided to bat first after winning the toss. We were all in agreement that we should put runs on the\nboard and try to put the English under pressure. Sehwag got out early but then Rahul Dravid and\nSanjay Bangar, our makeshift opener for the game, put together an excellent partnership of  that\nturned things our way. Batting wasn\u2019t easy on a fresh wicket and they both played exceptionally well,\nleaving a lot of balls outside the off stump.\nI went in to bat in the last session of day one and decided to wear an inner-thigh guard. I had never\nused one before, even in practice, but Andrew Flintoff was getting the ball to jag back in to the\nbatsmen and I thought the inner-thigh guard might be a sensible protection against injury. However, I\nsoon realized that my stance had completely changed. Normally the forearm of my bottom hand rests\non my thigh while I take stance, but at Headingley it felt completely different because of the new\nguard. I immediately decided to get rid of it and the experiment was never tried again.\nIn this innings I was circumspect to start with and decided to play out the day, waiting for my\nopportunity the next morning. Flintoff bowled a hostile spell and I really had to knuckle down. He was\ngetting the ball to swing and bounce and there was not much I could do but defend. The following\nmorning Matthew Hoggard, who had the ability to swing the ball both ways, also bowled impressively,\ngetting the ball to move away from the bat at good pace. Quality outswing is difficult to negotiate and\nI had to be watchful while playing big drives on the rise. Shot selection in this innings was the key.\nAndrew Flintoff produced another really probing spell. He was bowling into Sourav\u2019s body and it\nwas decided that I would face up to him while Sourav, a left-hander, took as much strike as possible\nagainst Ashley Giles, who was once again bowling a defensive line to me outside my leg stump. When\nwe went back for tea to the dressing room, Sourav said, \u2018Woh beech wale Flintoff ka spell humne kya\njhela yaar. \u2019 (We did really well to see off Flintoff\u2019s spell.) I couldn\u2019t resist pulling his leg and\njokingly said to him, \u2018Humne jhela? Saala maine jhela hain!\u2019 (Did we? I was the one who negotiated\nFlintoff!) The whole dressing room burst out laughing.\nIn the third session of the day we shifted gears and launched into the English bowlers, who were\ngradually starting to tire. It was one of those rare matches in which we refused to take the light even\n\n\fwhen the umpires offered it to us. We were dominating proceedings and there was no reason to go off.\nIn the end the umpires came up to us and said that as they could not see the ball they were calling it\na day. I was unbeaten on  and we had a mammoth score on the board. We could not lose the Test\nmatch from that position and we already had enough runs for our bowlers to play with. By the time\nEngland\u2019s turn came, their task would be even more difficult, because the wicket was becoming\nuneven and the odd ball had started to keep low. In fact, it was a low bounce that cost me my wicket\non the morning of the third day, when I was lbw to Andrew Caddick for . We finally declared our\nfirst innings at \u2013, one of our highest ever scores on English soil.\nThe bowlers took over and from the start of the English innings managed to put them under\npressure. Kumble and Harbhajan bowled beautifully in tandem in conditions that were not so helpful\nfor spinners and picked up three wickets each in the innings. There were no big partnerships and we\nkept taking wickets at regular intervals, finally bowling England out for  and then enforcing the\nfollow-on. Our huge first-innings score had allowed us to put a lot of fielders in catching positions and\nwe attacked the whole time.\nIn the second innings, with close to  runs in the bank, we kept up the pressure and gave each\nEnglish batsman a hard time. Even Nasser, who scored a hundred in the second innings, wasn\u2019t spared\nand there was a lot of banter in the middle. We were all extremely motivated and did not want a single\nEnglish batsman to settle down and take control. Nobody held back and our bowlers made regular\ninroads into the English batting. Each wicket was followed by a lot of talk and the new batsman was\ngiven a rousing welcome. When Andrew Flintoff got out for a pair, caught by Dravid at slip off Zaheer\nKhan, our left-arm fast bowler, we knew we were within striking distance of a famous victory. Anil\ndid the rest, picking up four wickets, and we bowled England out for , winning the match by an\ninnings and  runs.\nAt Trent Bridge in the previous Test we had played well to draw the match and now we had cashed\nin at Headingley. Kumble bowled his heart out for his seven wickets in difficult conditions and all the\nother bowlers \u2013 Zaheer, Ajit Agarkar, Sanjay Bangar and Harbhajan \u2013 chipped in with important\nwickets.\n\nFourth Test, The Oval, \u2013 September \nWe followed up with another very good performance at The Oval. Rahul played a gem of an innings\nand his  allowed the rest of the batting to revolve around him. This match had special significance\nfor me because it was my th Test. I was nervous and excited on the morning of the game and the\nchief executive of Surrey County Cricket Club, Paul Sheldon, presented me with a commemorative\nplaque. A special announcement was made and when it was my turn to bat people were expecting me\nto carry on from where I had left off at Headingley. I hit some good shots on my way to my halfcentury, but then I unexpectedly got out to a ball I completely misread.\nI could see the ball in Caddick\u2019s hand as he was about to start his run-up and it was clear that the\nshiny side was on his right side, or the on side. With normal swing, that would indicate an outswinger,\nso I said to myself here\u2019s an opportunity for a big drive and I was ready to play the ball between mid\noff and cover. To my complete surprise, the ball came in a long way and hit me on my heel. I have\nrarely been beaten so comprehensively and was out plumb lbw. The ball had reverse-swung and it was\nthe first and only ball that did so in the innings. In normal circumstances Caddick didn\u2019t bowl big\ninswingers, but got the ball to cut in to the batsmen. On this one occasion he somehow got the ball to\nreverse-swing a mile. It was particularly difficult to deal with because it was a Yorker-length delivery.\n\n\fIt was unusual for me to misread a bowler\u2019s swing in that way, as I normally backed myself to work\nout what the bowler was up to by watching the ball in his hand. For example, every time Ben\nHilfenhaus, the Australian fast bowler, held an old ball cross-seam, I knew he would bowl a bouncer \u2013\nand I would be prepared for it. This strategy came in handy during the India\u2013Australia series in India\nin , when I managed to score a double hundred in Bangalore. Similarly, I noticed that the Pakistan\nfast bowler Shoaib Akhtar would swing his bowling arm twice before he delivered his effort ball as he\ntried to generate more pace into the delivery. Again, I would be prepared for it.\nAs for spin bowlers, I have always monitored a bowler\u2019s release point to work out what the bowler\nwas planning. In the case of the Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan, he would have his thumb on\ntop of the ball when bowling a doosra. For his normal off-spin deliveries, he had his thumb below the\nball. We once had a conversation in the dressing room on how to pick Murali\u2019s doosra and I told\neveryone that all they needed to do was watch his thumb. One day, we were practising at the SSC\nGround in Colombo when Murali came to the ground. Bhajji decided to go up and ask him how to\nbowl the doosra. Murali told Bhajji to use his thumb to support the ball from the top \u2013 that was the\nsecret. I had no idea about this conversation until Bhajji told me later. I felt very gratified that I had\nworked it out for myself.\nBeing able to spot the doosra helped me a lot, and not just when I was batting. When I did an over\nof commentary during the final of the IPL in May , I said on air that Bhajji had just bowled a\ndoosra to dismiss the South African fast bowler Chris Morris. Morris had played for conventional offspin when the ball had actually gone the other way. The commentators, including Harsha Bhogle on\nair, said they were impressed because they had not been able to pick the doosra and the replay had not\nyet been shown.\nI should also say here that there were other occasions when I found it difficult to figure out what a\nbowler was planning to do. One bowler I found particularly challenging in this respect when I first\nfaced him was the New Zealand fast-medium bowler Dion Nash. His action was such that I thought he\nwould bowl inswingers at me, which he never did. I got out to Nash on the flattest of decks because I\nplayed for the inswinger when the ball was actually an outswinger. Eventually I worked him out, and\neven got a hundred against him in Wellington, but it did take me a while to do so.\nAnother bowler I had great difficulty picking at first was the West Indian left-arm fast bowler Pedro\nCollins. I had first seen Collins in a practice match during our May\u2013June  tour of the West Indies,\nwhen he bowled our opening batsman Wasim Jaffer with a big inswinger. I made a note that here was\na bowler who started with inswing early on. Accordingly, in the next few innings I played for this\ninswing, only to see the ball leaving me and I ended up nicking deliveries behind the wicket. I was out\nto him three times and didn\u2019t last more than two or three balls in each of these innings. Midway\nthrough the series, I spoke with a number of West Indies players and I was told that actually Collins\nhardly ever bowled inswing \u2013 he normally got the ball to angle away from the right-hander. So by the\ntime of the final Test in Jamaica I was more confident against him and I managed to score .\nThe best bit about dealing with Collins, however, happened in India when the West Indies visited in\nNovember . By then I had fully worked him out and had started to consciously watch the shine to\ntell which way the ball would be moving, because he was reverse-swinging the ball. If the shine was\non the outside I would even leave balls pitched on middle stump because I knew that by the time the\nball passed the stumps it would be close to the sixth or seventh stump. This frustrated Collins and\nafter a while he realized my strategy and decided to go round the wicket. That\u2019s when the mind games\nstarted. He did all he could to stop me seeing the shine of the ball. He ran in from right behind the\numpire so that he wasn\u2019t in my line of vision. To counter this strategy, I deliberately pulled away once\n\n\for twice and subsequently asked the umpire to crouch. I said I wasn\u2019t able to see the bowler and did\nnot know when he was about to deliver the ball.\nThen I did something completely unorthodox. I decided not to take my stance when Collins was at\nthe top of his run. Instead, I moved to the off side so that I could see how Collins was holding the ball.\nI knew once he started running in he couldn\u2019t change the grip and I had just enough time to come back\nand take my stance. It was actually hilarious: a batsman standing wide of off stump, craning his neck\nto see a bowler\u2019s grip. It\u2019s not an everyday sight in international cricket. The strategy worked\nsurprisingly well and I more than made up for my bloopers against him in the West Indies earlier in\nthe year.\n\nNatWest Series, June\u2013July \nThe Headingley win, which helped us to draw the Test series, followed a memorable victory in the\nNatWest tri-series, making it a fabulous English summer for India. England, Sri Lanka and India were\nthe three teams playing for honours and we met England in the final after playing each other three\ntimes in a round-robin format. The final on  July was one of the most exciting one-day\ninternationals of my career, and it is still fondly remembered by scores of Indian cricket fans.\nAll the way through the NatWest series I had been in good form, with two hundreds in the six pool\ngames. We had successfully chased down several high scores and we weren\u2019t overawed by the\nEngland total at Lord\u2019s. Rather, we were silently confident of reaching the steep target of . We\nstarted the run chase well, with Sehwag and Sourav scoring freely and laying a brilliant foundation.\nHowever, as often happens in cricket when you are chasing a big total, we lost a number of quick\nwickets and slipped to \u2013 in no time. I was out bowled trying to cut a ball from Ashley Giles. By\nnow the mood in the dressing room had turned sombre and nobody was speaking \u2013 until Yuvraj Singh,\nthe talented left-handed batsman, and Mohammad Kaif, a right-handed middle-order batsman and\nexcellent fielder, started an unlikely recovery act. They were scoring boundaries freely and at no point\ndid the asking rate go beyond manageable limits.\nOnce the partnership had started to blossom I had a feeling that something dramatic might happen. I\ncan\u2019t explain why, but I was convinced it was not all over for us yet. The rest of the team sensed the\nopportunity too and soon each run was cheered in the dressing room. I was sitting on a table in the\nmiddle of the room and was eating one energy bar after another. I was not particularly hungry but in\nthe intensity of the moment kept polishing off the bars. Before long the atmosphere had changed\ndramatically and everyone was engrossed in the game. Cricketers are a superstitious lot and no one\nwas allowed to shift position. If someone wanted to go to the toilet, he wasn\u2019t allowed to do so in the\nmiddle of an over; he could only go at the end of an over and had to come back before the start of the\nnext.\nBy the fortieth over, Yuvraj and Kaif had got the measure of the English bowling and we realized\nwe had a real chance of winning the title. The next few batsmen were all charged up and even when\nYuvraj got out for  there was no dip in intensity. Kaif was still out there and we knew that the target\nwas within reach. Finally, when Zaheer and Kaif ran the winning runs in the last over of the match, the\ndressing room leaped in delight. We could not stop smiling and hugging each other \u2013 and Sourav did\nthe unthinkable of taking off his shirt and waving it above his head as he stood bare-chested on the\nLord\u2019s balcony. It is an iconic image now but for some reason Sourav is always much too embarrassed\nto talk about it whenever I ask him!\nWe stayed in the dressing room for hours, picking over the finer points of the victory. We\u2019d heard\n\n\fthat the England team had ordered champagne by the middle of our innings and had put a number of\nbottles on ice. With India at \u2013, an English win was deemed a mere formality. I don\u2019t know if this\nstory is true, but a number of our players suggested to the England team at the end of the game that it\nwas time to pass the champagne over to us. We would be happy to take care of it. A number of bottles\ndid make their way to our dressing room and we finished them off before we left Lord\u2019s.\nThere were Indian supporters everywhere and the stretch from the WG Grace Gate to St John\u2019s\nWood Tube station was packed with fans waving the tricolour and celebrating. The traffic had come to\na standstill, with people playing music on the road and enjoying the moment. The police were\nextremely patient and realized it was a special occasion. A large crowd had waited for us to leave and\nwere all waving at the team bus and taking pictures as we finally left Lord\u2019s with the trophy. It was a\nday few of us would forget.\nThe victory, which had seen youngsters like Yuvraj and Kaif come to the fore, suggested that the\ncore of India\u2019s team for the  World Cup was gradually coming together. It also proved that we\nhad a side capable of doing well in overseas conditions. In Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Javagal\nSrinath, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh we had a more than competent bowling line-up, and with\nSehwag, Sourav, Rahul, Yuvraj, Kaif and myself, we were capable of out-batting any opposition. Now\nit was important to sustain the momentum and peak at the right time to have a crack at the world title\nthat had eluded us for so long.\nEngland in India \nst Test.

We lost to the Kiwis in both formats of the game and while\nthose defeats were demoralizing, as defeats always are, they helped the team to focus with just a\nmonth to go before the World Cup.\nWe played two Test matches in New Zealand and lost both. In the first Test at Wellington, which\nstarted on  December, we were beaten by ten wickets, with the match finishing in just three days.\nThe pitch offered a lot of assistance to the fast bowlers and even Parthiv Patel, our wicketkeeper, was\ngetting the ball to swing prodigiously in the nets.\nI played the first Test with an injured finger, which I had hurt during practice. On the first morning,\nwhen the rest of the team were on the ground preparing to play, I was in hospital with Andrew Leipus\ngetting my finger checked. The pain was getting severe and I was finding it impossible to catch the\nball. Even when a fielder gently tossed the ball to me to pass on to the bowler I was having difficulty\ncatching it. Batting was not so much of a problem, as I could grip the bat as normal, but fielding was a\nreal issue. I asked the doctor to numb my finger, but he refused, saying I would have no idea where my\nfinger was and might break it if I didn\u2019t catch the ball properly. All I could do was put up with the\npain.\nWhen I got back to the ground, I went up to captain Sourav Ganguly and suggested I should field at\nshort leg. In that position, the ball would either lob to me or, if it was a firm hit, I would receive the\nblow on my body instead of attempting to catch it. Both of these possibilities were fine by me. At\nshort leg no one expects you to stop a full-blooded shot with your hands. It was one of the few times I\nstood in that position in the second half of my career.\nAlthough the second Test match at Hamilton the following week was a low-scoring game, in the end\nit turned out to be a competitive one. On reaching Hamilton, we were shocked to see the track had\nbeen watered so much that the pitch was incredibly damp two days before the Test match. Then a lot\nof rain fell and the covers couldn\u2019t be removed to allow it to dry properly. John Wright, our coach,\ntried inserting a key into the pitch the day before the match and the whole key went in without any\neffort. It was anything but a good Test wicket.\nThe dampness delayed the start by four hours on the first day, despite it being bright and sunny in\nHamilton. The umpires did the right thing by waiting, as there was no way Test cricket could be\nplayed in such conditions. The crowd was getting restless but there was nothing the umpires or players\ncould do. When the match finally started we lost the toss and were sent in to bat first in nigh-on\nimpossible batting conditions. We were bowled out for , with no one managing to get in.\nI was sitting next to John Wright when Harbhajan was going out to bat, with India six wickets down.\nJohn, a New Zealander, had tried telling us that we needed to stay at the wicket and that batting was\nexpected to become easier with time. I told John not to say anything to Harbhajan about digging in.\n\n\fFar better that he should just go out and swing his bat. Time wasn\u2019t a factor, as the match was not\nlikely to last the full five days anyway, and whatever runs he managed to score would be valuable.\nHarbhajan went on to make a quick , all in boundaries, and got out trying to defend the ninth ball he\nfaced. His innings gave John a good laugh amidst all the disappointment of the low score. While\nBhajji had scored  in no time, all the batsmen who had tried to stick around struggled to reach\ndouble figures.\nNew Zealand didn\u2019t do any better; in fact, we managed to get a first-innings lead of five runs, which\njust goes to show the nature of the wicket. In the second innings Rahul and I had a pretty good\npartnership but neither of us managed to kick on for a big score. After the partnership was broken,\nwickets fell in a heap and we finally set New Zealand a target of .\nI must mention the unique feat of Ashish Nehra in this game. He was the first man to bat twice and\nbowl in two innings on the same day in Test cricket. We had scored \u2013 by the end of the first day\u2019s\nplay and Ashish was one of the not-out batsmen. He resumed his innings on the second day but we\nwere soon all out for . He was then part of our attack as we bowled New Zealand out for  in their\nfirst innings, before we ourselves were bowled out in our second innings for . Finally, when New\nZealand came out to bat in the fourth innings of the match, Ashish had another bowl at them in the\nfinal moments of the day.\nWe discussed his feat in the dressing room and wondered if anything of the sort had happened\nbefore. A total of twenty-two wickets had fallen in a day and there wasn\u2019t much that the batsmen on\neither side could do in such conditions. It was disappointing for the crowd, who had come to watch a\nfive-day game. Their only consolation was that the match was very close in the end and the home team\nwon by four wickets.\n\nFighting for fitness\nWith both Test matches over early, I decided to spend a lot of time in the gym working on my fitness\nahead of the World Cup. Sehwag was my training partner and we used to award marks. We worked on\nspecific body parts each day and rated each other for the effort put in. We even joked that we were\nperhaps scoring more marks in the gym than the total runs we had scored in the series. But both\nSehwag and I were confident that the effort put in would pay off sooner or later.\nAfter the Test series was wrapped up we played a seven-match one-day series, losing \u2013. Again,\nmost of the wickets weren\u2019t really suitable for international cricket. I did not feature in the first four\nmatches because of an ankle injury, which I sustained in practice on the eve of the first one-dayer at\nAuckland. It was one of the few freakish injuries I have had in my career. I had just finished bowling a\nlong spell to each of our batsmen when Srinath called out, \u2018Last ball, with four runs to win.\u2019 I picked\nup the ball again to bowl one final delivery at him. I had not noticed a big hole in the corner of the\npractice pitch and, unluckily for me, as I ran to stop Srinath\u2019s shot, my foot landed in the hole and I\nslumped to the ground in agony. After a frustrating couple of weeks, I eventually made a comeback in\nthe fifth match of the series, at Wellington, and was promptly out for a duck. In fact I scored just one\nrun in each of the next two matches and Anjali and I joked about my scores \u2013 which read , ,  \u2013\nbeing the dialling code for an Indian city!\nThe New Zealand experience was best summed up by the home captain Stephen Fleming. At the end\nof the tour Fleming stated that the tour had done enough to breed a sense of false complacency among\nthe bowlers, while the batsmen were now worrying about flaws in technique that weren\u2019t really there.\nThe conditions were simply not good enough for international cricket and the series was not the best\n\n\fadvertisement for the game.\n\nWarming up\nThere was no doubt I was not in the best physical shape when the team left for the World Cup in South\nAfrica and Zimbabwe in February . I was recovering from three injuries: the finger, the ankle and\na strained hamstring. As a result, at our training camp in Paarl, in the Western Cape, I was not able to\nrun with the team and spent my time cycling to keep up my cardio exercises. It was frustrating, but I\nknew I had to push myself to get back to fitness before the first match of the tournament against the\nNetherlands on  February.\nThe injury that bothered me most was the ankle. It had not fully healed and I had to strap it before\nevery practice session and match. Strapping the ankle all the time became an ordeal and it started to\nfrustrate me. So much so that one day I was careless when removing the strapping after training and\nsuddenly felt a strange sensation in my hand. I was holding the strapping, which had a thick layer of\nmy skin on it, which had come out of my heel. The skin was stuck to the tape and I ended up putting it\nback because otherwise there would have to be a hole in a sensitive area of the foot. I know it sounds\ngruesome, but there was little else I could do in the circumstances. After that it was particularly\npainful when I had to go into the sea with the rest of the team as part of our recovery routine and the\nsalty water would really sting. The incident at least taught me to be more careful about handling my\ninjuries, however frustrating they might be.\nWe played two practice games, both against the KwaZulu-Natal side. While we batted reasonably in\nthe first game on  February in Pietermaritzburg, with Yuvi and Dravid both doing well, the game on\n February at Chatsworth didn\u2019t go according to plan. We managed to get the opposition out fairly\ncheaply, and I remember Sourav saying that, because we needed as much batting practice as possible,\nthe opposition should bowl the full quota of fifty overs to us, even if we\u2019d achieved the target. In fact,\ntowards the end of the Natal innings we were all trying to give them some extra runs and Sourav kept\nclose-in fielders in the ring to allow them to score freely, so that we would have a decent total to chase\ndown. But in our reply we collapsed well before the fifty overs and the question of the opposition\nbowling the full quota never arose! We were all out for  and lost the match by  runs.\nIn both matches I had batted at number three, which was the result of a decision that had been taken\nsoon after we had reached South Africa. There had been a meeting of the senior players and the coach,\nand most of my team-mates, including Sourav, Rahul and Srinath, felt I should bat at number three in\nthe competition. Only Anil suggested that I should open. The majority argument was that at the top of\nthe order I might get a good ball early on and get out, which would end up putting the team under\npressure. After the second practice game John Wright came to my room and asked me if I was really\nhappy batting in the number three position. I assured him that I would bat anywhere the team wanted\nme to. John, however, insisted that I should voice my personal opinion as a player, so I said that, if it\nwere up to me, I would prefer to open. I went on to say that I felt I could control the game from that\nposition, and I also told him that there was no guarantee anyway that I wouldn\u2019t get out early if I was\nbatting at number three or four, as it only takes one good ball. So I thought my best opportunity to set\nup the match for India was as an opener. John agreed with me and finally convinced Sourav and the\nrest of the team that having me at the top of the order was our best option.\n\nThe pool games\n\n\fThe less-than-impressive performances in our warm-up matches had made the first pool match on \nFebruary , against the Netherlands, extremely important. We had to start well to give ourselves a\nfighting chance in the tournament. Even if the Netherlands were not the best opposition in the world,\nthey had some good players in their team who had experience of playing on the county circuit in\nEngland. As I went out to bat, I was unusually nervous. The expectations in India were huge and the\ndressing room was also expecting a lot from me, now that they\u2019d agreed to my wish to open the\nbatting. I\u2019d caused our plans to be changed completely and now it was up to me to deliver.\nI was deliberately conservative in my approach at the start and set out to build a solid foundation\nbefore we went on the attack. We had been getting out for scores of  and less and it was important\nthat we batted the full fifty overs and posted a reasonable total. I managed to score a half-century and,\nwith Mongia contributing  runs down the order, we just passed the -run mark, making  all\nout. It wasn\u2019t a score to rave about and we knew that with one good innings from a Netherlands\nbatsman we might have a contest on our hands. At the team meeting before the start of their innings\nwe agreed that we should play as if we had to bowl the opposition out for , to force us to apply\nourselves properly. Eventually, it was Srinath and Kumble, with four wickets each, who helped us\nachieve that aim as we bowled them out for . We had not played our best but had still managed to\nwin.\nOur next match was against defending champions Australia at Centurion on  February. They were\nplaying excellent cricket and were firm favourites to win the tournament again. We played a very bad\ngame from the start and lost a heap of early wickets. I scored  and we were bowled out for a very\npoor  and lost the game by nine wickets.\nOur underwhelming performances in South Africa so far were not going down well with supporters\nat home and we heard that some irate fans had vented their fury that evening by throwing tar at\nMohammad Kaif\u2019s home in Uttar Pradesh. It was alarming to read about the hostile reaction in India\nand I eventually had to issue a formal appeal, in the form of a media release, to try to pacify the fans. I\nstated that we were all trying our best and there was no dearth of commitment at our end. This had\nsome effect and we were able to concentrate once again on the task at hand.\n\nStopping the rot\nIn  Zimbabwe were a very good side in home conditions, and included some very talented players\nin their ranks. It was only after \u2013, when the country was laid low by political turmoil, that many\nof these players stopped playing for Zimbabwe. In our pool game against them in Harare we played\nwell from the start and won by  runs in the end. We could sense that we were getting back into form\nand it was surprising how one good win could boost a team\u2019s confidence. I scored  off ninety-one\nballs and Bhajji picked up the crucial wicket of Andy Flower, Zimbabwe\u2019s best batsman. Now we\nneeded to carry this form forward, as we would soon be playing England in what was likely to be a\ncrucial match for us, one that could guarantee a place in the Super Six.\nBefore the England match, however, we had to play Namibia on  February and it was important\nnot to take it easy against a relatively weak team. We kept the pressure up and scored \u2013, with\nSourav and me both scoring hundreds. Our bowlers then dismissed the opposition for , with Yuvraj\nSingh taking four wickets for six runs, and though not much could be read into our performance\nagainst a team like Namibia, it was apparent that things were moving in the right direction.\nThe build-up to the England game at Durban on  February was something else. England versus\nIndia is always a big game, but this time it was the World Cup and it was a must-win game for both\n\n\fteams. Apparently Andrew Caddick said a number of things before the game and our players who read\nthose statements were fired up on the eve of the match. I had not read them and to this day don\u2019t know\nexactly what was said. I had scored runs in all three matches so far and was simply looking forward to\nanother opportunity.\nWe won a very important toss and decided to bat first. Batting under lights at Durban is always a\nchallenge and winning the toss had given us the early advantage. Our plan was not to give away early\nwickets, even if we didn\u2019t score quickly. Once the first five or six overs had gone by we started\nshifting gear and looking for runs, passing  in no time. Durban always offers something for the fast\nbowlers and I knew that Caddick and the other tall England bowlers would look to exploit the extra\nbounce by bowling short of a length. I was ready for the short ball and it finally came in the ninth over\nof the innings when Caddick bowled one a foot and a half outside the off stump. It was exactly what I\nwas waiting for and I swivelled back and hit him over midwicket for six. The moment the ball hit my\nbat I knew it was going the distance.\nIn his next over I played one of my favourite shots of the World Cup. I was hoping Caddick would\nover-compensate and bowl a fuller delivery, which he did. It wasn\u2019t a bad ball but I managed to play\nan off drive on the up, bisecting mid off and the bowler for four. The timing and impact felt\nwonderful. I hit two more boundaries in the same over and we raced to  off just eleven overs.\nIt was a dream start in a very big game and it took a great spell from Andrew Flintoff to bring\nEngland back into the match. He conceded just  off his ten overs and picked up two wickets. He\ncaught and bowled Sehwag for  and then had me caught by Collingwood at point for . It was an\nextraordinary spell that undid our good start. At this point Yuvraj was getting increasingly restless in\nthe dressing room and I remember saying to him that it had to be his day. It was now his responsibility\nto finish the innings off with a flourish and make sure that we did not squander the early advantage.\nYuvraj and Rahul went on to bat beautifully to take us to  at the end of our innings, but we still felt\nwe were  runs short.\nThe England innings started well for us with an incredible piece of fielding by Mohammad Kaif.\nNick Knight, the left-handed opening batsman, had played the ball off the back foot and was running a\nquick single when Kaif swooped in from cover to pick up the ball and dived full-length to break the\nwicket. England were \u2013 and we had an early breakthrough. It was an excellent piece of athleticism\nfrom one of our best fielders.\nWe picked up Marcus Trescothick, the other opener, when he mistimed a pull off Zaheer and ended\nup giving me an easy catch at backward square. It was then that Ashish Nehra took over. It was easily\nthe best I have seen Ashish bowl and he looked a man possessed that night in Durban. He was getting\nthe ball to move both ways and was bowling at speeds between  and  kph, making it extremely\ndifficult for the England batsmen to negotiate his pace and swing. It must be one of the best spells of\nfast bowling by an Indian bowler in a limited-over international. By the thirtieth over England were\neight wickets down with more than  runs still required. Rahul, who was keeping wicket in that\ntournament, and Sehwag took some good catches off Ashish\u2019s bowling and the whole team was fired\nup. We could sense we were knocking on the door of the Super Six stage.\nIndia eventually won the match by  runs. It was now a question of sustaining the momentum for\nthe rest of the tournament. This time there were great celebrations back home and India were suddenly\nthe team to beat in the competition. While Durban had set us on course, our next match against\nPakistan was just massive. It was one of the most high-pressure cricket matches I have played in and\nhad enormous significance for our fans back home. Without doubt it was the match of the World Cup.\n\n\fBattlefield Centurion\nThe first time I heard people talking about the India\u2013Pakistan fixture at Centurion Park on  March\n was exactly a year earlier, when some of my friends had been discussing it with great\nexcitement. It was always going to be a huge game for both teams. The intensity was such that I could\nnot sleep properly for three nights before the game. If there was ever a match we wanted to win, it was\nthis one. The nation would brook no failure and for many of our fans this was the true final. It really\ndid not matter to them what happened in the rest of the tournament, as long as we managed to beat\nPakistan at Centurion.\nThe ground was buzzing hours before the match. It was sport at its best. This is why I played\ncricket, to be out in the middle for my team, on the world\u2019s biggest cricketing stage, against India\u2019s\narch rival. Listening to the national anthem and singing the words gave me goose bumps.\nPakistan batted first after winning the toss and put together a very good score. Saeed Anwar held the\ninnings together and made a very important hundred for his team. Their total of  was at least \nruns more than we wanted to chase. As we were walking off the pitch, Sourav asked me if we should\nhold a brief team meeting. I said there was no need. Everybody knew what to do and it was now time\nto go out there and do the job.\nDuring the break I hardly spoke to anyone at all. Nor did I eat much. In fact, for most of the time I\nhad my headphones on and listened to music, trying to work myself into the right frame of mind. I just\nhad a big bowl of ice cream and a banana to give myself some energy and asked one of the players to\nlet me know as soon as the umpires had walked out to the middle. When they were in position, I\npicked up my bat and went out to start the run chase.\nGenerally it was Sehwag who took first strike, but this was a day with a difference. On the way out I\ntold him that I would take strike and said that we needed to play out the initial burst from the\nPakistani fast bowlers before we started attacking. Needless to say, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and\nShoaib Akhtar were capable of doing a lot of early damage.\nThat\u2019s not how it turned out, however. In the very first over of our innings, I drove Wasim to the\ncover boundary. Then I took a single off the next ball and Sehwag scored a boundary off the final\ndelivery. Shoaib Akhtar bowled the second over and in many ways it turned out to be the defining over\nof the match. His first ball to me was a wide. The next ball I played watchfully. I scored a single off\nthe third ball and then he bowled another wide to Sehwag, which also allowed us to go through for a\nsingle. It was his sixth ball that allowed me to go after him. It was short and wide. I sighted the ball\nearly and within a fraction of a second had made up my mind to go over third man. It wasn\u2019t exactly\nthe upper cut but more of a hard slash over the third-man fielder that sailed over the boundary. Trying\nto compensate for the short ball, Shoaib bowled the next one on a length on the off stump and I\nshuffled across and flicked him behind square for four.\nIt was a dream start. We had shed our initial inhibition and had started to attack. Having already\nscored  off his last two balls, I was intent on playing the final ball of the over cautiously, so I just\npunched it back towards mid on. It was a defensive stroke, but the timing was such that it sped across\nthe turf to the long-on boundary. We had scored  off the over.\nPakistan were obviously feeling the pressure when Waqar came on to bowl in the fourth over,\ngiving Shoaib a break after one disastrous over. Sehwag launched Waqar\u2019s first ball for six over third\nman and we attacked him straight away. We were now egging each other on and were speaking to each\nother loudly in Hindi, which the Pakistanis could understand, of course. Our body language had turned\naggressive and when I finished off the Waqar over with another four we were firmly in control. We\n\n\fhad not allowed the bowlers to settle down and had seized the advantage. It was the best early assault\nagainst Pakistan that I had been involved in and it could not have come at a more important time. We\nreached  in just five overs and the target of  was no longer the huge mountain it had seemed at\nthe start of our innings.\nAs with most India\u2013Pakistan matches, however, there had to be a shift in momentum and against\nthe run of play Pakistan picked up two wickets in Waqar\u2019s next over \u2013 first Sehwag and then Sourav\nwith the very next ball. Pakistan were back in the match. Mohammad Kaif came in next and it was\nimportant for us to put together a partnership and also not to get bogged down. Kaif played well and\nran hard between the wickets to make sure I had as much of the strike as possible. The run rate had not\ndipped and I reached my fifty with a scoring rate of over  for the innings.\nThis innings must rank as one of the best I have played because of the immense pressure it was\nplayed under. Each boundary brought me an ovation from the raucous crowd. Wearing the tricolour on\nmy helmet on sport\u2019s biggest stage against the nation\u2019s premier opposition while being watched by\nclose to a billion fans \u2013 what more could I have asked for? I just had to bat Pakistan out of the game.\nIt was in my seventies that I started cramping up. I received some treatment but refused to have a\nrunner as I have always been uncomfortable with someone else running for me. My concentration was\naffected and much as I would have liked to power on, it wasn\u2019t possible. I eventually got out to a short\nball from Shoaib Akhtar for . In that physical state I found it difficult to get up on my toes to keep\nthe rising ball down. I walked back to a standing ovation.\nImportantly, we still had a deficit of  runs and my innings would have little value if we lost a\ncouple of quick wickets. There was no need to fear, as Rahul and Yuvraj took control and finished the\nmatch with almost five overs to spare. They both made half-centuries and India had won a famous\ncontest, continuing our run of success against Pakistan in World Cups.\nI felt very proud when I went out to receive the Man of the Match award, a watch. It was one for all\nour passionate fans back home. I called a number of my friends in India and was told that the country\nhad erupted in celebrations. We were glad we could give our people such a moment to cherish.\nNobody wanted to call a halt to the celebrations in the dressing room, until finally the team decided\nto go out for something to eat, as we were all starving. It was close to midnight and we ended up going\nto a roadside stall for Chinese food. My friends Sunil Harshe and Sanjay Narang, there to cheer on the\nIndian team, also came along, and it was over our dinner of noodles that I decided to give Sanjay my\nMan of the Match watch to take back to Mumbai.\nSome time later, after we had finished dinner and were on our way back to the hotel, Sanjay\npanicked. He told me that he had left the watch at the Chinese food stall. At first I thought he was\njoking, but he wasn\u2019t and he said he would never joke about something as precious as a World Cup\nMan of the Match award. He immediately called the stall and told them he had left his Adidas bag\nbehind, saying that it contained his shoes rather than a gold watch. Then we rushed back and, to our\nenormous relief, an elderly lady handed over the bag with a smile.\n\nThe road to the final\nOur next three matches were against Kenya, Sri Lanka and New Zealand and we won them all\nconvincingly. India were playing fantastic cricket and we had started to believe that we could give\nAustralia a run if we made the final. Here I am a bit embarrassed to reveal a very personal secret\nrelating to the Sri Lanka match. On the eve of the match I had a bad stomach and was feeling\ndehydrated. This happened because I had not yet fully recovered from the cramp I had suffered while\n\n\fplaying Pakistan and as a result had had a lot of isotonic drinks. I also added a teaspoon of salt to the\nenergy drinks, thinking it would help the recovery, and that caused a tummy upset. In fact, the\nsituation was so bad that I had to bat with tissues inside my underwear. I even had to go back to the\ndressing room during one of the drinks breaks and was feeling extremely uncomfortable in the middle.\nI somehow scored , but batting with stomach cramps wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience. I was pushing\nmyself to the limits of endurance and in the end I was glad that the effort paid off.\nIndia were now in the semi-final and we were drawn to play Kenya, who had caused a stir by\nbeating a few of the top-ranked teams. In fact, during the match between Kenya and Sri Lanka, which\nwe watched in the games room in our hotel, a rather odd thing happened. Every time we said\nsomething good about a Sri Lankan player, the player got out. It was strange and in no time Kenya had\ncaused a huge upset.\nWe played our semi-final against Kenya at Durban and managed to win the match comfortably.\nSourav and I had a very good partnership and the team managed  in our fifty overs before bowling\nthe Kenyans out for . We were in the World Cup final, with eight straight wins behind us. The\ndefeat to Australia in the qualifying rounds seemed a lifetime away. Now we were playing them in the\nfinal and we were convinced we had the team to stop them from winning back-to-back world titles.\n\nSo near and yet so far\nUp till then, all of the players in the team had only watched others take part in a World Cup final. Now\nit was our turn. The excitement back home was extraordinary and a huge number of people had come\nto South Africa to cheer on the team. We had peaked at the right time and were playing some really\ngood cricket. Naturally we were all determined to give our best in the final but perhaps we got\nourselves too wound up. The evening before the final the team decided to spend some time in the pool.\nTo our surprise, the water was freezing but that did not stop us from jumping in together. I didn\u2019t\nsleep well that night.\nWhen we got to the ground the next morning, we immediately went over to take a look at the\nsurface. It was apparent to us all that there was moisture in the pitch and, given it was a day game, the\nfast bowlers were sure to get some early assistance. It would not be a bad idea to field first if we won\nthe toss. That\u2019s what we did, but the decision turned out to be a disaster, with Ricky Ponting playing\none of the best one-day innings of all time, making . Australia scored a mammoth  in their fifty\novers and had almost batted us out of the game.\nIn hindsight, I would still have opted to field. It was because we could not keep a lid on our\nexcitement that we lost the plot early on. Zaheer conceded  runs in the first over and though we still\nfelt we could make a comeback after that one bad over, it just didn\u2019t happen. Towards the concluding\nstages of their innings, every big shot that Ponting played made our task that much more difficult. In a\nfinal, every run scored after the total passes  is worth double and  was an intimidating target\nagainst a fantastic Australian bowling attack. In the team discussion at the interval we reckoned that\nwe needed to hit one boundary every over and then score the remaining  runs in  balls. It was\nan attempt to be positive, as there was no other option left to us at that point.\nI took first strike again and managed to score a four with a mistimed pull off McGrath. When I\nattempted a second pull shot I got a top edge and felt utterly dejected to see McGrath settle down\nunder the ball to take the catch. In situations like those you can only pray that the ball falls in no\nman\u2019s land or that the fielder makes a mistake. It was not to be and I was on my way to the pavilion.\nWhile walking back, I kept asking myself why on earth I had played that shot. Maybe I should have\n\n\fgiven myself two or three overs to settle down, but the pressure of the chase was such that attack\nseemed the only option.\nIn the middle of the innings there was some light drizzle and it turned really dark. My thoughts\nwent back to the South Africa series in January  when rain had denied us victory. This time I was\npraying for rain and hoping that the match would be washed out, forcing a re-match the next day. We\nwere not so lucky and were eventually all out for .\nAt the presentation it was difficult to watch the Australians celebrate while our own camp was\nfeeling the pain of defeat. When my name was called to collect the Man of the Tournament award for\nthe  runs I had scored, it didn\u2019t give me much excitement. I am not suggesting that I did not feel\nhonoured or proud, but the feeling was overshadowed by the loss. Now we would have to wait four\nyears before we could have another crack at the World Cup.\nIn my disappointment, I had not even noticed that the bat I was presented with as the Man of the\nTournament was made of gold and I just stuffed it in my kitbag and checked it in as luggage on the\nway back. Only when people asked to see the bat after we landed in Mumbai did I realize it was gold\nand had been specially crafted. All I did on the flight back was sleep. Most of the players were still\nupset and were in no mood to talk. It would take a long time to get over the disappointment.\nLooking back, the  World Cup remains a bitter-sweet memory. We played some excellent\ncricket as a team and I contributed well in almost all of the matches \u2013 but not in the final. Beating\nEngland and Pakistan were unforgettable high points, but the World Cup trophy was still eluding me.\nIndia in the  World Cup\nth match. India v Netherlands at Paarl.

    "2004-2008": " AWAY WINS\n\nAs soon as the World Cup was over I consulted a series of specialists and was advised to have an\noperation on the ring finger of my left hand because of calcification. There was no other option and in\nApril  I travelled to Baltimore, USA, with my family to get the surgery done. Dr Anant Joshi, as\non many occasions in the past, was with me, and his reassuring presence, together with that of my\nfriends Vini Desai and Paresh Bhakta, was always a great source of strength in moments like these.\nThe surgical process turned out to be slightly out of the ordinary because I was not the best patient.\nI was extremely worried that the doctors would cut open my palm. Cutting the palm would mean\nsubstantially altering my grip, which I really didn\u2019t want to do. I explained to both my surgeons the\nnuances of cricket and urged them to cut open the back of the hand. I was so obsessed with this issue\nthat I woke up during the surgery and asked them to show me where they had made the incision. Dr\nJoshi later told me that they were all surprised to see me awake despite the anaesthesia. The doctors\nshowed me that my palm had been left untouched and told me to calm down and allow them to carry\non. Satisfied, I instantly drifted back to sleep.\nThe surgery kept me off the field for close to four months. There was not much cricket scheduled\nthen and I missed only one tour, of Bangladesh, in the period I was out. The recovery was painful and,\nas often happens, I jarred the hand on a number of occasions during the period of convalescence. The\none time I hurt it really badly was when I was holidaying in London in June . Anjali and I went\nout for dinner and then took a taxi back to the hotel. While paying the taxi driver my finger got stuck\nin the glass of the window and I fell to the ground in severe pain. The taxi driver was alarmed but\nAnjali assured him that it was not his fault and told him to carry on. After a few painful minutes I\nfinally managed to walk back to the hotel.\n\nIndia in Australia, November \u2013February \nSo far,  had turned out to be a good year for Indian cricket. Making the World Cup final was\nsomething to be proud of, but there were still plenty of challenges ahead. We were due to play a Test\nseries against the world champions in Australia at the end of the year and that tour was to be followed\nby one to Pakistan in early .\nBefore leaving for Australia we played a one-day tri-series at home against Australia and New\nZealand in October and November . I was in good form and scored a couple of hundreds on the\nway to the final. Though we lost to Australia at Eden Gardens, I came away from it feeling confident\nof doing well in front of big Australian crowds.\nUnfortunately my series Down Under started in the worst possible fashion at the Gabba on \nDecember . I lasted just three balls and was given out lbw to Jason Gillespie when the ball struck\nthe top flap of my pad. I thought it would have gone over the stumps by six inches or more and I was\n\n\fdisappointed to see the umpire raise his finger. Sourav and VVS Laxman managed to steady the ship,\nand Sourav, captaining India for the first time in Australia, duly played one of his finest Test innings.\nHis  at Brisbane helped to set the tone for the series. At the end of the day\u2019s play he was ecstatic\nand had every reason to be so.\nThe first Test was drawn and we moved to Adelaide for the second Test on  December. The\nAdelaide wicket was good for batting and the Australians made the most of their opportunity. When\nthey scored  runs on the first day, I clearly remember the Australian team standing up on the\ndressing-room balcony and cheering the batsmen off the field. Day two started better for us and, with\nAnil bowling beautifully, we managed to restrict Australia to  in their first innings. With the good\nbatting conditions and a lot of time still left in the match, there was every chance we could make a\ncontest of it if we batted well enough.\nRahul was outstanding and his double hundred helped us get close to the Australian first-innings\ntotal. Laxman too was majestic and it reminded us of the incredible partnership Rahul and Laxman\nhad put together at Eden Gardens in March , only this time the roles were reversed, with Rahul\ngetting a double hundred and Laxman a hundred. I lasted just six balls before I was caught by Gilchrist\noff the fast bowler Andy Bichel. It was an annoyingly soft dismissal.\nThe Australian second innings belonged to Ajit Agarkar, my team-mate from Mumbai. He produced\nhis best ever spell to set up the match for us. He took six Australian wickets for just  runs as we\nbowled the Australians out for , leaving us with  to chase. We fielded brilliantly in this innings\nand took some amazing catches, Aakash Chopra\u2019s catch of Ponting at point off Ajit being the standout. I chipped in with two crucial wickets, bowling leg-spin. Steve Waugh and Damien Martyn had put\ntogether a good partnership and it was immensely satisfying to be able to get both of them out caught\nin the slips. It was time for the batsmen to close out the game.\nRahul was yet again the star performer and I managed to contribute  before falling lbw to legspinner Stuart MacGill. We had put together a -run partnership at a critical time in the match, which\nwas particularly satisfying. Rahul hit the winning runs for us, remaining unbeaten on , and the team\nwas thrilled to have taken a \u2013 lead in the series. We stayed in the dressing room till late and\nthoroughly savoured the moment. Never in our history had we managed a \u2013 lead against Australia in\nAustralia. We had matched the Australians in every aspect of the game and had a very good chance of\nwinning the series if we continued to play at our best. Rahul and Laxman were in imperious form;\nSehwag and Sourav had made important contributions in both Tests; Aakash Chopra, our second\nopener, had done a good job of blunting the new ball.\nOn the eve of the next game \u2013 the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne \u2013 I decided to take Anjali, Sara\nand Arjun out onto the ground, just to give them a feel of what it is like to be inside a stadium.\nStanding in the middle of the MCG, they could imagine for themselves what we go through with more\nthan , people in the stands. It was Arjun\u2019s first visit to a stadium.\nWe batted first after winning the toss on  December and Virender Sehwag played what must be\none of the best Test innings ever seen at the MCG. He was in his attacking mode and played some\nstrokes that only he can play. I have no doubt that Sehwag at the top of the order was one of the best\nthings to happen to Indian cricket and he played a key role in leading us to the top of the world Test\nrankings in . He really should have got a double hundred at the MCG, but was out for  hitting\na Stuart MacGill full toss to long on.\nThe rest of the batsmen unfortunately failed to capitalize on the start Sehwag and Aakash Chopra\nhad given us and we were all out for , allowing Australia back into the game. I faced only one ball,\ngetting a faint tickle down the leg side to Gilchrist, who was standing way back to Brett Lee. I turned\n\n\faround to see the ball travelling to Gilchrist and knew that it was the end of me. That is one of the\nworst ways of getting out and I felt embarrassed. I felt even worse when I was told that Anjali had\ncome to the MCG to watch after being persuaded by some of the other wives. I heard that she left the\nground the moment I was out and walked all the way back to the hotel. I couldn\u2019t help reflecting on\nthe occasionally cruel and unpredictable nature of our much-loved game.\nAustralia responded impressively, playing brilliantly in their first innings and, with Ponting scoring\n and Hayden , effectively batted us out of the game with their  total. Close to  runs\nbehind, we would have to bat exceptionally well to save the match. We did not, and the series was \u2013\nwith one Test to play.\nOnce again, I did not make the contribution I had hoped for in the second innings at the MCG. To\nchange things a bit, I asked Sourav what he thought about batting ahead of me. It was towards the end\nof the third day\u2019s play and Sourav, who was in good form, agreed to step up, allowing me the cushion\nof going in to bat the following morning at number five. The ploy seemed to work and all was going\nwell until I got out for , caught by Gilchrist off the fast bowler Brad Williams. I had been in control\nuntil I played one false shot, the feature of my batting in the series. It seemed that every time I tried to\nmove up a gear, I lost my wicket.\n\nIt all comes down to Sydney\nOn the eve of the fourth and final Test match in Sydney at the beginning of January , John Wright\ncame to my room to try to get me to think positively and boost my confidence, which was a great help.\nI had also had a long conversation with Ajit, and one challenge he put in front of me was to try to\nremain not out in both innings. He said that I was allowing myself to get out to bowlers, rather than\nmaking them have to take my wicket, and that if I decided to rein myself in, no bowler would be able\nto get me out. I took up the challenge and decided to play a waiting game. Even if I looked ugly in the\nmiddle I was intent on sticking to my plan. Having got out twice in the series playing aggressive shots,\nI was simply not going to try anything extravagant at the SCG. True to my promise, I played what was\nin some ways one of my most difficult Test innings. I consciously checked my shots and was\ndetermined not to get out. In more than ten hours at the crease I did not play a single cover drive.\nWhen the Australian bowlers cracked a few jokes at my expense, I remained focused. It was a real\ntest. Even when balls were there for the drive, I let them go. It was all totally against my natural\ninstincts and it left me drained but immensely satisfied. At the end of our first innings, I was not out\non  and had taken the team score past .\nWhen I think about this Test, I can\u2019t help remembering that for some reason I turned unusually\nsuperstitious. Anjali, her parents, Sara and Arjun were with me on the eve of the match and we\ndecided to go to a Malaysian restaurant for dinner. The food was excellent and we ended up ordering\nnoodles, chicken and a host of other dishes. My family then left for India the next morning, but I had a\nvery good first day and was unbeaten on . In the evening I decided to stick to the routine of the\nprevious night and went to the same Malaysian restaurant, this time with Ajit Agarkar and a couple of\nother players. Not only did we sit at the same table, but I had exactly the same food. The next day\nwent even better and I was not out on . That night, I again went to the same restaurant and\noccupied the same table and ate the same food. On the third day of the match, with the Test match\ngoing really well for us, we went to the same restaurant one final time. The restaurant manager must\nhave thought we were mad. At the same time he must have been elated at the thought that we had\nreturned because of the food. Little did he know the real reason for our fourth consecutive visit!\n\n\fAfter my double century, I was sent to address the media. A local journalist said that I had been\ngetting a lot of flak in the press recently but, now that I had scored an unbeaten double hundred, would\nI be reading the papers the following morning? All I said to him was that I had not read anything\nduring the series \u2013 which was my way of keeping myself insulated from all the hype \u2013 and I was\nunaware of what they had written about me. I didn\u2019t have a problem with getting flak if I had not\nperformed. The media needed to do its job, after all. But I was not looking forward to reading the\npapers just because I had scored some runs \u2013 I did not need validation from the media. Criticism and\npraise are two sides of the same coin and, having played international cricket for fifteen years, I had\nlearnt to take these things in my stride.\nWe backed up the first-innings batting performance with a very good bowling effort and dismissed\nAustralia for , with Anil taking a remarkable \u2013. We were ahead by  and now we needed\nquick runs to give our bowlers time to close out the match. Yet again we batted well and Rahul and I\nwere in the middle of a good partnership when Sourav sent two or three messages out to check when\nwe should declare. Rahul was the vice captain of the team and I said to him that it was his decision as\nmuch as Sourav\u2019s. I was ready to go off whenever they wanted. Rahul was keen to bat on for a little\nlonger and we finally declared just after he was hit on the head by a Brett Lee bouncer when he was on\n and I was on  not out. In hindsight I must say we delayed the declaration too long. The ball was\nturning and bouncing, and we should have given Anil and the bowlers a few more overs on the fourth\nevening than the four they eventually bowled.\nSet  to win, Australia were under pressure throughout their second innings. Anil bowled a\nmarathon spell of forty-two overs, picking up four more wickets on the fifth day. In his final innings\nin Test cricket Steve Waugh played well to save his team some blushes. He was eventually out for ,\ncaught by me at deep square leg off Anil. The crowd was desperate for a final Steve Waugh hundred\nbut it didn\u2019t work out that way. Straight after taking the catch, I ran over to Steve and congratulated\nhim on a fantastic career and wished him all the best for his future endeavours as he received a\nstanding ovation from the Sydney crowd.\nAustralia held on for a draw and the series finally ended \u2013. Personally, it had been a great Test\nmatch for me and I was satisfied at having kept my promise to Ajit not to get out in both innings. It\nhad been extremely difficult to go against my natural instincts. But it was a series we really should\nhave won. We were the better team for most of it and had played exceptional cricket in patches. Had\nthe declaration on the fourth evening come a little earlier, and had we grabbed more of the chances\nthat came our way, we might have made history. Despite missing out on a series win, we still had\nreason to be happy and were looking forward to the tour of Pakistan that was just round the corner.\n\nIndia in Pakistan, March\u2013April \nThere was a lot of excitement about our tour to Pakistan. Playing Pakistan is always a big occasion for\nan Indian cricketer, and this was the first time we had played them in Pakistan since my debut series\nin . The tour also seemed to have come at the best possible time for India; we had done well in\nthe series Down Under and most of the players were in good form.\nAs soon as we landed in Pakistan we realized just how different this tour would be. Unlike the first\ntime, when I was just sixteen, in  I understood the full significance of an India\u2013Pakistan series.\nThe security was simply unbelievable. We were whisked through immigration and on our way to the\nhotel we had a security vehicle ahead of the team bus. There were also bikes escorting the bus and we\neven had a chopper flying above us. In the hotel we were received warmly and given instructions\n\n\fabout the security protocols we were expected to follow. We were informed that the first room on our\nfloor was to be occupied by security personnel, who would check every visitor who came to the floor.\nThe floors above and below us had been sealed off. I had not experienced security like that before and\nit was a very strange feeling, because we were just sportsmen who had come to Pakistan to play\ncricket.\nLeaving the hotel wasn\u2019t an option and this meant the players spent a lot of time in each other\u2019s\nrooms having dinner, playing cards and watching movies. It was always fun to be able to spend time\ntogether and the spirit of the team was excellent as we prepared for the first one-day international in\nKarachi on  March .\nIt was the best possible start to the series, with the match decided on the very last ball. After we had\nscored  batting first, Pakistan responded well but came up short, with  in their fifty overs.\nUnfortunately, we lost the next two matches, but we did well to come back with victories in the final\ntwo games, winning the series \u2013. The final match was a thriller and we beat Pakistan by  runs in\nthe end. I have fond memories of this match, having taken a very good catch to dismiss the Pakistan\ncaptain Inzamam-ul-Haq. In this series Inzamam would invariably try and hit the slow bowlers\nstraight back over the bowler\u2019s head, so before the fifth ODI Murali Kartik and I made a plan for him.\nWe agreed that I would stand far straighter than normal at long on and would be ready to move\ntowards the sightscreen the moment Inzamam was on strike. Sure enough, he hit Kartik straight back\nover his head and I was ready for the opportunity. I caught the ball above my head just inches from the\nboundary rope and then sprinted towards my team-mates in the middle, knowing we had managed to\nprise out the most important Pakistan wicket. In the end it was a terrific result and it gave us\ntremendous confidence ahead of the first Test at Multan.\n\n\fFirst Test, Multan,  March\u2013 April \nAt Multan, Virender Sehwag played a blinder. We won the toss and from the word go he was in\ncontrol. He played some outstanding shots and his innings had the effect of demoralizing the\nopposition on the very first day of the series. He flayed the Pakistani bowlers to all parts of the ground\nand by the time I joined him in the middle he was already well past his century.\nI remember that just after tea Sehwag seemed to lose concentration. He began trying to hit every\nball and looked a bit agitated. I walked up to him to calm him down and told him that he just needed\nto hang in there and let this spell pass. I also said to him that he should check himself a bit, as\nsomething big was about to happen. It was important to grab this opportunity and not let it slip away. I\nwas glad to see him grind it out on his way to a double hundred. As soon as he reached the milestone,\n\n\fhe was back in his groove and the shots started to flow again. I was even more delighted when he\nmanaged to get to a triple hundred on the second morning. It was an incredible effort and coming\nagainst Pakistan made it all the more special.\nBy the time Sehwag reached that landmark, I had made a century. I had paced my innings nicely\nand we were now firmly in the driver\u2019s seat. At teatime I asked stand-in skipper Rahul Dravid, who\nwas in charge because Sourav was out with a back injury, and coach John Wright what the plan was. I\nwas informed that we were looking to give Pakistan an hour to bat and so would put them in with\nfifteen overs left on the second day.\nIt was perfectly sensible and I went about my business after tea with this plan in mind. In fact, I was\npacing my innings so that I could reach my double hundred and we could still give Pakistan fifteen\novers to bat, as was the plan. But then, a little more than half an hour into the post-tea session, Ramesh\nPowar, who was substituting in the game, came onto the field and asked me to accelerate. I even joked\nwith him, saying I was aware that we needed quick runs but with the field totally spread out, there was\nonly so much we could do.\nA little later, when I was on , he came out again and said that I should try and get to my double\nhundred in that over itself because Rahul had decided to declare. I was startled, to say the least,\nbecause in my mind I still had twelve balls in which to score the remaining six runs before fifteen\novers were left for the day. However, as it happened, I did not get to play a single ball in that over,\nwith Yuvraj on strike against Imran Farhat, Pakistan\u2019s opening batsman and part-time leg-spinner. He\nblocked the first two balls before picking up two runs off the third ball. He once again blocked the\nfourth ball and was out to the fifth ball. Then, just as Parthiv Patel, the next batsman, started to come\nout, I saw Rahul gesturing us to go back to the pavilion. He had declared the innings with me stranded\non  and with sixteen overs still left for the day, one more than we had agreed at tea. I was shocked,\nas it did not make any sense. It was day two of the Test match and not day four, as it had been in\nSydney a month earlier.\nDisappointed and upset, I made my way back to the dressing room and could sense that the whole\nteam was surprised at the decision. Some of my team-mates perhaps expected me to throw my gear\nabout in the dressing room in disgust and create a scene. However, such things are not in me and I\ndecided not to say a word to anyone about the incident. I calmly put my batting gear away and asked\nJohn Wright for a little time before I went out to field because I was feeling a little tight after batting\nfor so long. Inside I was fuming.\nJust as I was washing my face in the bathroom, John walked up to me and apologized. He was sorry\nabout what had happened and said he had not been party to the decision. I was surprised and said to\nhim that as coach he was one of the decision-makers and there was no reason for him to be sorry if he\nbelieved in what had been done. I also said that what was done could not be reversed and it was best to\nleave it alone. Finally, I couldn\u2019t help reminding him that the declaration was contrary to what had\nbeen discussed at tea and it was strange that I was not given even one ball to get to my double hundred\nafter a message had been sent out asking me to get there as quickly as possible.\nSoon after my exchange with John, Sourav came up to me and said he was very sorry at what had\nhappened and that it wasn\u2019t his decision to declare. This was a little surprising because Sourav, as the\nskipper, was part of the teatime discussion and was also present in the dressing room at the time of the\ndeclaration. I said to him there was no point going over it any more.\nAt the end of the day\u2019s play I was asked by the press if I was disappointed by the declaration and I\nhad no reason to shy away from the truth. Soon after the press conference I put my headphones on and\nlistened to music all the way back to the hotel. Then I hit the gym to work out my frustration. Some of\n\n\fthe Pakistan players were also in the gym but none of them spoke to me, sensing the state of mind I\nwas in. I worked myself hard, trying to get the declaration out of my mind, then headed up to my room\nfor some time alone.\nIn the evening Professor Ratnakar Shetty, our manager, came to my room for a chat. I had known\nProfessor Shetty since I was a youngster in Mumbai. He apologized for what had happened and said he\ndid not agree with the declaration. However, it was a cricketing decision and he did not ever interfere\nwith cricketing decisions as manager. I assured him that it was over and done with and would not\naffect my contribution to the team.\nIt was when I was talking to Professor Shetty that Sanjay Manjrekar, who was in Pakistan as a\ncommentator, turned up in my room. Sanjay said that it had been a brave decision to declare and that\nit was a good sign for Indian cricket. He carried on in that vein until I asked him if he really knew\nwhat he was talking about. I explained to him that he was not aware of what had transpired in the\ndressing room and had arrived at his judgement without knowing the real facts of the matter. I made it\nclear that I did not appreciate his opinion, which I thought was a deliberate attempt to be different.\nThe following morning, Rahul finally came to me and said he had heard that I was upset and wanted\nto have a chat. I informed him that I was indeed upset and there was no way I would pretend\notherwise. I asked him what the thinking was behind declaring at the time that he did. It wasn\u2019t as if\nwe were pressing for a win, and one over wouldn\u2019t have made much difference. We had agreed to a\nplan at tea and I was doing exactly as I had been told.\nRahul said that the call was taken with the interests of the team in mind. It was important to\ndemonstrate to the Pakistanis that we meant business and were keen to win. I wasn\u2019t convinced. First,\nI said to him that I was batting for the team as well. Yes, I had scored , but the  was meant to\nhelp the team and it was my individual contribution to the team\u2019s cause. So to say that the decision\nwas taken in the best interests of the team wasn\u2019t altogether correct.\nI reminded him of what had happened in Sydney less than a month earlier, when we had both been\nbatting on the fourth evening and Sourav had sent out two or three messages asking when we should\ndeclare and Rahul had carried on batting. The two situations were comparable and, if anything, the\nSydney declaration was far more significant and may have cost us a Test match and series victory. If\nRahul was so keen to show intent here in Multan, he should have done the same in Sydney.\nRahul didn\u2019t say anything to this and stated that I would surely get another opportunity to score a\ndouble hundred. I disagreed, saying it would not be the same. I would have to bat from zero to score a\ndouble century and would not be starting my innings at . Before I brought the conversation to a\nclose, I assured Rahul that the incident would have no bearing on my involvement on the field, but off\nthe field I would prefer to be left alone for a while to come to terms with what had happened.\nDespite this incident, I am glad to say Rahul and I remain good friends, and even on the field our\ncamaraderie remained intact until the end of our careers. We continued to have some good\npartnerships and neither our cricket nor our friendship was affected.\n\nLearning from history\nA very similar situation arose a few years later, in December , when we were playing England at\nMohali. It was the last day of the Test match and Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj were both in the\nseventies. Yet again there was talk of a possible declaration in the dressing room. It was being argued\nthat we needed to declare immediately and put the English in for some thirty overs so that we could\ntry and force a win.\n\n\fI intervened and stopped the declaration. Dhoni was our captain then and Gary Kirsten our coach. I\nsaid that I had been in this situation before and did not want a repeat of what had happened to me.\nThere was no way we could win the game by putting the English in after lunch. There was not enough\ntime \u2013 particularly because on each day so far, play had finished early because the light in Mohali did\nnot last long and the last day was expected to be no different. In such a situation, what was the point of\ndeclaring and depriving the two batsmen of the chance to get their hundreds? Gautam had already\nscored one in the first innings, so he had a rare opportunity to make a hundred in each innings. Yuvraj,\non the other hand, had played a key role in winning us the first Test at Chennai and it was only fair to\ngive him the chance of a Test hundred.\nFinally, I said it was our responsibility to look after the interests of all individuals who were part of\nthe team, because a bunch of happy individuals make a happy team. I wasn\u2019t suggesting that we\nshould place individual interest ahead of team interest. However, in a situation where there was no\nchance of winning the match, it was essential to give both batsmen a chance to get their hundreds. I\nconvinced Gary that it was the right thing to do for the team and was glad that he agreed with me.\nUnfortunately, however, both Yuvraj and Gautam missed their hundreds. Yuvi was run out for \nand then Gautam was out for , which was when we finally declared the innings at \u2013. Soon\nafterwards, I joked with Yuvraj and Gautam, complaining that I had delayed the declaration for them\nboth and yet they had not scored their hundreds. In fun, I said to Yuvraj, \u2018 Tumhe mein ek laath dunga,\ntum run out ho kar aaye for  aur maine tumhare liye declaration ko roka! \u2019 (I will kick you. I\nstopped the declaration for you and you got run out for !)\n\nA series win to remember\nIn the end it took us just thirty minutes on the final day to wrap up that first Test at Multan in .\nBefore that I had had a part to play with the ball against Pakistan wicketkeeper Moin Khan. I had\ndismissed Moin before in exhibition games and started playing mind games with him, telling one of\nmy team-mates, \u2018Main ise pehle bhi out kar chuka hoon. Aaj bhi yeh main isko out karunga.\u2019 (I have\ndismissed him before and today also I will get him out.) Moin heard the conversation and smiled at\nme, saying, \u2018Aaj toh main tujhe chakka marunga.\u2019 (Today I will hit you for six.) I told him that I\npromised to flight the ball, so \u2018Chalo mar ke dikhao.\u2019 (Come on, try and hit me.) Then I shouted to my\nteam-mates to give Abdur Razzak a single and get Moin back on strike. For the last ball of the day, I\ndecided to bowl him a googly, because he was trying to pad up to every delivery. The ball pitched on\noff stump, turned exactly as I had hoped and went through his legs to hit leg stump. It was a key\nwicket and helped to swing the momentum in our direction. In the second Test at Lahore, however, we\nwere outplayed. Though Yuvi scored a very good hundred for us, we were always playing catch-up and\nwere never in the contest.\nThe third and deciding Test at Rawalpindi started on  April. Sourav was back in the side and to\nmaintain balance we decided to open with Parthiv. Lakshmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan, our two\nswing bowlers, bowled very well throughout the series and this match was no different. Balaji picked\nup four wickets and we restricted Pakistan to  in the first innings. Then, with Rahul leading the\nway with a spectacular double hundred, we put  on the board in reply.\nThis time Pakistan had been outplayed and we finished the formalities on day four by bowling them\nout for . Anil took four wickets and I took the tenth and final wicket of the innings bowling legspin. Though the match was over on the fourth day, it was not without drama or embarrassment. That\nmorning we dropped four catches in no time. They weren\u2019t difficult and we all seemed to be dropping\n\n\fthe ball like a hot potato.\nIt was a terrific series win and our first in Pakistan in fifty years. Coming at the back of the \u2013\nODI series win, it marked the end of a brilliant tour.\nIndia in Australia \u2013 \u2013 The Border-Gavaskar Trophy\nst Test.

It was just another net session before the Videocon Cup triseries involving Australia and Pakistan towards the end of August . Ajit Agarkar was bowling to\nme and bowled a short one, which I fended off with one hand. I instantly realized I had done\nsomething to my elbow. Andrew Leipus, our physio, didn\u2019t like the look of it at all. It turns out he was\nright to be concerned.\nIt was an unfortunate situation because my in-laws had travelled to Amsterdam with their friends\nfrom London to see me play and here I was nursing what was later diagnosed as tennis elbow. To\ncomplicate matters, I also had a virus and for a good three days couldn\u2019t set foot outside my hotel\nroom. I was desperate to get back in shape as quickly as possible because the ICC Champions Trophy\nin England started in September and in October Australia were due to arrive in India for a four-Test\nseries.\nI did all I could to get the elbow injury treated. An expert in Amsterdam tried to help it by\nmanipulating my wrist. He suspected the elbow was being overloaded because of stiffness in my wrist,\nbut unfortunately those painful sessions didn\u2019t help much. Then I tried shockwave therapy, which\ninvolved a machine that looked like a hairdryer being placed on my elbow. The feeling reminded me\nof blowing up a balloon and at one point I thought my elbow was going to burst under the pressure.\nAnjali was about to join me in England and I called her to say she should bring a video camera\nacross. I remember telling her that she would never see me in more physical pain, and we videoed one\nof the sessions to keep a record of what I had to go through. I was due to undergo three sessions but I\nurged the doctor to administer a fourth one if he thought it would help me get fit quicker. Anjali\u2019s\npresence had given me the courage to press on with the recovery and I was desperate to get fit,\nparticularly for the Test series against Australia. Seeing my desperation, one of the doctors asked me\nhow important that series was for me and why I was so determined to play. I said that it would be like\nmissing my own wedding reception and there was no way I would want to do that!\nDespite all my efforts, I was in no condition to take part in the Champions Trophy and I also had to\nmiss the first two Tests against Australia. It was extremely frustrating to be forced to sit out and watch\nClarke and Gilchrist score centuries to set up a -run victory for Australia in the first Test at\nBangalore, despite eleven wickets in the game for Harbhajan Singh. I even had a steroid injection on\nthe eve of the second Test match in Chennai, but it didn\u2019t work. The Chennai Test was a draw and then\nfinally, after two weeks of complete rest, the pain had subsided enough for me to return for the third\nTest at Nagpur on  October . It wasn\u2019t the greatest comeback match. On a seaming pitch,\nGillespie took nine wickets and Damien Martyn just missed out on a century in both innings, as\nAustralia won by  runs. My contribution was a disappointing total of ten runs.\nIn the final Test at the Wankhede Stadium the following week, Rahul and I were at the crease in the\nsecond innings when all of a sudden I felt a searing pain in my elbow again. It was at a critical stage in\n\n\fa low-scoring match and I was worried that I had rushed the comeback and was going to let my team\ndown. I immediately asked for some painkillers and, thinking to myself that it would have an instant\neffect, decided to chew up two tablets rather than gulping them down. Gritting my teeth, I dug in and\nmanaged to battle my way to . With Laxman scoring a brilliant , we set Australia a target of \nin the fourth innings. Helped by another five-wicket haul from Harbhajan and three from the left-arm\nspinner Murali Kartik, who was the Player of the Match, we proceeded to bowl Australia out for just\n and won the match by  runs. The pain was definitely worth it. Unfortunately for Kartik, he did\nnot get another chance to play Test cricket for India after that.\nWe followed the Australia series with two home Tests against South Africa in November . The\nfirst at Kanpur was a draw, but the second at Kolkata, starting on  November, brought a very\nsatisfying victory, with Bhajji proving a match-winner again, this time taking seven wickets in the\nSouth African second innings.\nEven though I was still not fully fit, my contribution was gradually improving and by the time of\nthe first match in a two-Test series in Bangladesh in December, I was in good enough form to make\nmy highest Test score \u2013  not out \u2013 at Dhaka. It was also my thirty-fourth Test hundred, equalling\nSunil Gavaskar\u2019s world-record tally. He was actually commentating in Bangladesh at the time and he\nkindly sent me a fabulous gift of thirty-four bottles of champagne to make it a truly memorable day in\nmy career.\n\nThe elbow surgery\nIn March  Pakistan were scheduled to visit us at home for three Tests and seven ODIs. It was a\ntour I really did not want to miss and I pushed myself as hard as I could, trying to ignore the soreness,\nbut I eventually realized that I was struggling for form and I wasn\u2019t doing my elbow any good. It was\ntime to face the prospect of surgery, something I\u2019d hoped to avoid.\nThe procedure was carried out on  May  and I was told it would be four and a half months\nbefore I could hold a cricket bat. Those months were extremely difficult. I couldn\u2019t help worrying that\nmy career might be over and would often pray to God that my career should not come to an end like\nthis. It was very frustrating not doing anything and at one point I hung a ball in a sock below our\napartment and tried doing some shadow practice with a plastic bat, but even that was really painful.\nThe last two months were the hardest. I could barely sleep and would have to go out for long drives in\nthe middle of the night with my friend Faisal Momen just to try and calm down a little.\nThe first games I played after the surgery were in a domestic competition, the limited-overs\nChallenger Trophy in Mohali in October . The elbow was not completely back to normal but I felt\nit was time to try it out. In my very first day of practice I experienced some pain in my shoulder after\na throw. Here I was recovering from left elbow surgery and now my right shoulder was hurting. I put it\ndown to my prolonged absence from the game and went ahead with the games, but the pain increased\nwith each passing day and I even started having problems with my right elbow.\nI was in Baroda when I got to know that my surgeon, Dr Andrew Wallace, was in Delhi for a day.\nHowever, with no flight connections to Delhi from where I was, I was beginning to get worried about\nhow to get to him before he left. That\u2019s when my good friend Amit Bhatia stepped in. Amit, who is an\nardent cricket fan, gave me a ride in his private jet and made sure I reached Dr Wallace in good time.\nOn examining my shoulder, Dr Wallace said that during rehabilitation athletes often put too much\nload on the non-injured limbs to compensate and it was likely that\u2019s what had happened to me. He\nasked me to have a few scans, to figure out the nature of the problem. I did not want to fuel more\n\n\fspeculation in the media about my injury, so when I went to get the scans done, I resorted to wearing a\nburkha, which shows how difficult things were at the time! John Gloster, our new physio,\naccompanied me to the hospital and the scans revealed a small cyst next to a nerve. I was told I needed\nto get it removed as soon as possible, though I could play on for the moment.\nMy return to international cricket finally happened on  October  in the first ODI of a series\nagainst Sri Lanka. It was a truly emotional moment when I took the field after six months out and the\nfirst thing I did was to look up to the heavens and thank God for giving me another opportunity. I\nscored  and this time it was exactly the sort of comeback I had hoped for. My first scoring shot was\na cover drive for four against the medium-pacer Farveez Maharoof and I flicked the next ball to\nsquare leg for another boundary. I was determined to make the most of this lifeline. We won the\nmatch by  runs and went on to take the series \u2013.\nIn the three-Test series that followed in December  I scored my thirty-fifth Test century,\nmaking the world record my own. The hundred had eluded me for a while and at Chennai, the venue\nfor the first Test, I was beginning to wonder how long I would have to wait. Though most of the drawn\nChennai Test was lost to rain, something happened there that put me in good spirits: I had a dream in\nwhich I saw myself scoring the thirty-fifth hundred in Delhi, the venue of the second Test.\nI didn\u2019t really expect it to work out that way, of course, but then towards the end of  December,\nthe very first day of the Delhi Test, I found myself in the nineties as the light began to fade rapidly.\nThe umpires were discussing whether to stop play, but I was desperate to stay out there and was\npraying that they would continue the match for just another few minutes. They did so and Chaminda\nVaas, the left-arm fast-medium bowler, was put on to bowl. Vaas was bowling wide of my off stump\nwith a packed off-side field and I knew I had to try something different. I decided to play a chip shot\nbehind the wicket from way outside off stump, a shot no one would expect me to play just a few runs\nshort of my century. I got it just right and to everyone\u2019s surprise reached  with a well-calculated\nrisk.\nThe umpires checked the light again at the end of the over and to my relief decided to carry on. I\nknew I had at least a few more minutes to get to the hundred. In the next over from Vaas, by which\ntime I had picked up two more singles, I had already made up my mind not to repeat the shot. I\npredicted that Vaas would be expecting me to paddle-sweep and would change his line and bowl to me\non the stumps. I was proved right and he bowled a ball on middle stump which I played towards\nsquare leg for a single.\nI was so delighted at reaching the century that I did something very out of character. I shouted in\njubilation and celebrated in a manner I had hardly ever done in my career. I was very proud of the\nachievement. We went off shortly afterwards and when I got back to the dressing room I couldn\u2019t\ncontrol my emotions. With tears flowing down my cheeks, I made four phone calls \u2013 to Anjali, Ajit,\nmy mother and Achrekar Sir \u2013 to thank them for all they had done.\nWhile I managed to play in the Sri Lanka series, followed by three Tests against Pakistan in January\n and England in March , Tests in which I didn\u2019t do a great deal, I realized that shoulder\nsurgery was unavoidable if I harboured any ambition of going to the West Indies for the Test series in\nMay. I decided not to play in the one-day series against England and went ahead with the operation on\n March in London.\n\nThe shoulder operation\nIt wasn\u2019t quite as straightforward as planned. As normal, I was sedated before being moved to the\n\n\foperating theatre, but for some reason I suddenly woke up on the trolley and asked the nurse if the\noperation was over. She was shocked to see me awake and told me that it had not even started. There\nhad been some complication with the previous operation and mine had been delayed. I drifted back to\nsleep but a little later woke up again and asked a doctor if the ordeal was finally over. To my surprise I\nwas told that this time they had had to wake me because of an unexpected discovery. They had spotted\na ruptured tendon in my right biceps and needed my consent to fix it while they did the shoulder\nsurgery. I agreed, but asked them to make sure I recovered in time for the West Indies series! In fact,\nas soon as I\u2019d got back to my room from the operating theatre, I cried and cried because I thought I\nwas going to miss the West Indies series, which I was very eager to play in.\nWithin five weeks of the double surgery I picked up a cricket bat and even played a few shots to\ntennis balls. My family and friends Atul Ranade and Jagdish Chavan were with me throughout the\nrecovery and I got them to bowl at me from  yards to get used to the extra pace that I was likely to\nencounter in the West Indies. In hindsight I concede that I probably pushed myself too hard. When my\nphysio and doctors asked me to play thirty balls a day, I played sixty.\nAfter practising to short-pitched bowling for four days, I asked one of my friends to bowl at me\nfrom the full  yards, to get used to swing and seam movement. All was fine until I felt a sudden\njerk. I immediately stopped and one look was enough to frighten me. My biceps was hanging like a\nhammock and my first impression was that I had ruptured it again. I was desperate to speak to John\nGloster and report what had happened, but John was then in the West Indies with the team and,\nbecause of the time difference, I had to wait eight or nine hours before I was able to speak to him.\nThose hours were a real nightmare. John advised complete rest for the next few days. The incident had\nreally shaken me up. A week later I went to Chennai and met up with our trainer, Ramji Srinivasan. I\nwanted to work on my physical fitness, even if I couldn\u2019t bat. I trained hard for a week but it was to no\navail. I had lost confidence completely and decided not to go to the West Indies for the June  Test\nseries.\nLed by Rahul Dravid, who had replaced Sourav Ganguly as captain, the team played outstandingly\nwell. Rahul batted brilliantly in truly trying conditions and we won the four-Test series \u2013. It was our\nfirst series win in the Caribbean for thirty-five years \u2013 and I was frustrated at missing every single bit\nof the action. I called my team-mates after the victory and congratulated them on a fantastic series\nwin.\nBy the time the team returned from the West Indies and were ready to go to Sri Lanka for three\nODIs in August, I had recovered enough to join them, though throwing was still a bit of an issue.\nDisappointingly, the Sri Lanka series was a washout \u2013 only twenty-two balls were bowled in the first\ngame because of rain and the second and third games were abandoned completely \u2013 although it did at\nleast allow me more time to recover. Frustrated because of all the rain, we ended up sitting out on the\nhotel-room balcony playing carrom.\nThe next tournament was a tri-series in Malaysia in September  against Australia and the West\nIndies, and I was delighted to score a big hundred in the first game of the competition against the\nWest Indies. My innings of  not out finally put all my injury concerns to rest, though it was\ndisappointing to lose the rain-shortened match by the Duckworth-Lewis method.\nHeartened by my successful comeback, I kept promising my team-mates that I would get them a\nrun-out in the tournament. I said that all the opposition players were aware of my injuries and were\nbound to take some risks against me, assuming I wouldn\u2019t be able to throw hard. It happened exactly\nas I had predicted and I got Australia\u2019s Damien Martyn run out when he took on my arm while\nfielding at third man. I celebrated by sprinting back to the wicket and my team-mates were delighted\n\n\fthat I had kept my promise. I was back.\nAustralia in India  \u2013 The Border-Gavaskar Trophy\nst Test.

We had made the final four\nyears earlier and had faltered at the very last hurdle. We were all desperate to go one better this time\nand expectations at home were very high.\nWe played well in our two practice matches against the Netherlands and the West Indies in Jamaica\nin early March. We scored  batting first against the Netherlands, for a decisive -run win, and in\nthe next match our bowlers polished off the West Indies for , setting up a nine-wicket victory. We\nseemed to be getting into a good rhythm for our first group match against Bangladesh on  March,\nbut at the same time there was no question of being complacent or taking them lightly. Bangladesh\nhad beaten decent opposition before.\nThe match was tough for many reasons. When we batted, the pitch was damp and it was extremely\ndifficult to play shots in the first ten overs. Mashrafe Mortaza, Bangladesh\u2019s medium-fast bowler, was\nperforming well and we had lost two early wickets when I went in to bat. I was batting at number four\nin this competition, as requested by the team management. I was perhaps a little surprised to bat in\nthat position, because we had experimented with my batting position before, on the eve of the \nWorld Cup, only to agree that I could contribute most as an opener. But the team management\u2019s\ntheory was that the tracks in the West Indies would be slow and low and I would be able to manoeuvre\nthe spinners in the middle of the innings. As it turned out, almost all the wickets had bounce and\nmovement and the strategy backfired on us.\nMy plan was to see off the new ball before gradually picking up the scoring rate. Sourav and I\nsuccessfully negotiated the early swing and, with the spinners on, I decided to play an inside-out shot\nover extra cover. Unfortunately the ball from left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak hit the inside edge of my\nbat, ricocheted into my pad and went on to hit the stumps. It was not the start to the World Cup I had\nhoped for.\nNot much went right for us on the day. Although Sourav scored  while opening the batting, Rahul,\nthe captain, made only  and then Dhoni got out for a duck trying to play a cut shot, caught at short\nthird man. It was one of those days when things just didn\u2019t click and we ended up with a below-par\nscore of . In reply Tamim Iqbal, the left-handed opening batsman, gave Bangladesh a quick start\nand they managed to reach the target fairly easily in the end, with five wickets to spare.\nNot all was lost after one defeat, however, and there was still time to pull things round. We knew\nwe had to win the two remaining group matches and that the run rate might come into the equation. In\nour second match against Bermuda, we went out and played our shots and won by  runs. Thanks to\nour total of , the net run rate had been beefed up and we only had to beat Sri Lanka to progress to\nthe next stage.\nWe started well against Sri Lanka on  March and kept their score to a manageable . There\u2019s\nlittle doubt that we were capable of chasing down that total, but despite our best efforts things did not\n\n\fgo to plan. I got an inside edge to a ball from fast bowler Dilhara Fernando; hearing the ball hitting the\nstumps in such a crucial match was devastating. When we were all out for  the dressing room was\nin shock and some of the players were in tears. Most were just completely silent. I found it very\ndifficult to get over the disappointment. It was definitely one of the lowest points of my cricket career.\n\nA difficult homecoming\nAfter we returned to India, the media followed me back home and it hurt when I heard my own people\ndoubting the commitment of the players. The media had every right to criticize us for failing, but to\nsay we were not focused on the job was not fair. We had failed to fulfil the expectations of the fans,\nbut that did not mean we should be labelled traitors. At times the reaction was surprisingly hostile and\nsome of the players were worried about their safety.\nHeadlines like \u2018Endulkar\u2019 hurt deeply. After eighteen years in international cricket, it was tough to\nsee things come to this and retirement crossed my mind. My family and friends like Sanjay Nayak did\nall they could to cheer me up and after a week I decided to do something about it. I started to do some\nrunning, to try to sweat the World Cup out of my head.\nOn top of all this our coach, Greg Chappell, was publicly questioning our commitment and instead\nof asking us to take fresh guard, was making matters worse. It seems to me that Greg Chappell must\ntake a lot of responsibility for the mess. I don\u2019t think I would be far off the mark if I said that most of\nus felt that Indian cricket was going nowhere under Chappell.\nIn my opinion, Indian cricket benefited significantly when the BCCI decided to end Chappell\u2019s\ntenure in April . Several of our senior players were relieved to see him go, which was hardly\nsurprising because, for reasons hard to comprehend, he had not treated them particularly fairly. His\nattitude to Sourav, for example, was astonishing. Chappell is on record as saying that he may have got\nthe job because of Sourav but that did not mean he was going to do favours to Sourav for the rest of\nhis life. Frankly, Sourav is one of the best cricketers India has produced and he did not need favours\nfrom Chappell to be part of the team.\nChappell seemed intent on dropping all the older players and in the process damaged the harmony\nof the side. On one occasion, he asked VVS Laxman to consider opening the batting. Laxman politely\nturned him down, saying he had tried opening in the first half of his career because he was confused,\nbut now he was settled in the middle order and Greg should consider him as a middle-order batsman.\nGreg\u2019s response stunned us all. He told Laxman he should be careful, because making a comeback at\nthe age of thirty-two might not be easy.\nUnlike John Wright and Gary Kirsten, who coached India before and after Greg and made a priority\nof keeping the players happy, Greg was like a ringmaster who imposed his ideas on the players\nwithout showing any signs of being concerned about whether they felt comfortable or not. In fact, I\nlater found out that Greg had spoken to the BCCI about the need to remove the senior players, no\ndoubt hoping to refresh the team.\nI also remember that every time India won, Greg could be seen leading the team to the hotel or into\nthe team bus, but every time India lost he would thrust the players in front. In general John and Gary\nalways preferred to stay in the background, but Greg liked to be prominent in the media.\nJust months before the World Cup, Chappell had come to see me at home and, to my dismay,\nsuggested that I should take over the captaincy from Rahul Dravid. Anjali, who was sitting with me,\nwas equally shocked to hear him say that \u2018together, we could control Indian cricket for years,\u2019 and that\nhe would help me in taking over the reins of the side. I was surprised to hear the coach not showing\n\n\fthe slightest amount of respect for the captain, with cricket\u2019s biggest tournament just months away. I\nrejected his proposition outright. He stayed for a couple of hours, trying to convince me, before finally\nleaving.\nA few days after Greg had come to my house, I suggested to the BCCI that the best option would be\nto keep Greg back in India and not send him with the team to the World Cup. I also said that we as\nsenior players could take control of the side and keep the team together. That\u2019s not what happened, of\ncourse, and the  campaign ended in disaster.\nGreg has since written a lot of things about the Indian cricket team. Perhaps it is time to set matters\nstraight. It came to light later that Greg was being filmed for a documentary, Guru Greg, during this\nperiod which went into a lot of detail about what was happening behind the scenes. It says a great deal\nabout his tenure as coach that I and other players did not even know about this. Why were the players\nnever asked if they felt comfortable with this? I wonder if he had permission from the BCCI to record\nhis documentary. Wasn\u2019t it a clear infringement of the players\u2019 privacy?\nWhile we may never get answers to these questions, suffice to say that Greg\u2019s tenure as coach was\nthe worst of my career. There is no doubt we failed as a collective in , but his high-handed\nmanner added to our disappointment and, in the immediate aftermath of defeat, had a harmful impact\non Indian cricket.\n\nUnwelcome opinions\nThe outrage in India after the  World Cup was not helped by armchair experts who were sitting\nthousands of miles away but still passing judgement on Indian cricket and suggesting I should \u2018have a\ngood long look into the mirror\u2019 and think about retiring. Such opinions, which were published in\nIndian newspapers, provoked fans across the country. I have never quite understood why Ian Chappell,\nwho was merely reporting on the game, should have got a headline in the Indian press. Would any of\nour former players commenting on Ricky Ponting or Michael Clarke have had a headline in the\nMelbourne Age or the Sydney Morning Herald? Chappell would have done better to stick to Australian\ncricket.\nI remember meeting Ian Chappell in Durban in  during the Champions League Twenty and\nhaving a most interesting discussion with him. I bumped into him as I was coming out of a health club\nafter a session in the gym with my physio, Nitin Patel, who was party to the entire exchange. Ian\nstarted the conversation by saying that now he knew the secret behind my scoring big runs. I reminded\nhim that he was conveniently changing his stand, considering what he\u2019d written about mirrors and\nretirement in . I said to him that I had not done what he suggested back then because I was well\naware of what I needed to do and how much cricket I had left in me.\nI also said that critics like him change with the wind. When the going is good, they write positive\nthings and when the going gets tough, they start making a lot of negative comments without ever\ntrying to find out what actually is going through a player\u2019s body or mind. He then asked me if I had\nchanged the weight of my bat. I told him that I hadn\u2019t changed a thing and was doing exactly what I\nhad been doing for twenty long years. He was the one who had conveniently changed his opinion\nbecause I had been scoring heavily between  and .\nFinally the conversation moved to Greg. I told Ian bluntly that Greg had not been popular and I\nwould not want to share a dressing room with him again. Ian attempted to argue that Greg had always\nhad a problem trying to understand failure and had had issues as captain of Australia. I said that that\nwas not my concern and all that mattered to me was that he had failed to take Indian cricket forward.\n\n\fIan was most surprised to hear all this. In fact, Nitin Patel told me soon after that I was the last person\nhe had expected to lash out like this.\n\nA welcome phone call\nAll in all, I was in a bad state after the  World Cup. I was not enjoying my cricket at all and was\nthinking about retiring \u2013 until I received some encouraging words from Viv Richards. Out of the blue,\nhe called me in India from the West Indies and we spoke for about forty-five minutes. He assured me\nthat there was a lot of cricket left in me and insisted that I shouldn\u2019t even think about stopping\nplaying.\nViv was my hero when I was growing up and he will always be a hero, no matter what success I\u2019ve\nachieved myself. We have got to know each other well over the years and whenever we meet, he treats\nme like his younger brother and I treat him like my older brother. I\u2019ve always respected him and his\nviews, so when he chose to call me and spend all that time convincing me to carry on, it meant a great\ndeal to me. When I finally got back into some good form and put together a very satisfying century in\nSydney at the beginning of , I made a point of calling Viv to thank him for his crucial support.\nIndia in the  World Cup\nth match, Group B.

Ravi Shastri, who was interim coach, played a key\nrole in helping us put the disappointment of the Caribbean behind us. Personally, it was a welcome\nchange, because Ravi and I have always been very good friends. Not only did we play together in the\nearly years of my career, but even after Ravi\u2019s retirement we spent a reasonable amount of time\ntogether on tours when he was commentating. He has an astute cricket brain, and, with his\nstraightforward and transparent attitude, we felt that we finally had a coach we could confide in.\nIn June we went to Ireland for a limited-overs series against South Africa. I was particularly excited\nabout visiting Ireland because my favourite rock band, U, come from there. The series posed an\nunusual challenge for us because it was freezing cold and it took us a while to get used to the\nconditions. Despite the weather, I had a good outing and twice got out in the nineties in the threematch contest, which we won \u2013.\nI also remember the series for an incident with Yuvraj during dinner in Belfast. I suggested to some\nof my team-mates, including Yuvraj and Zaheer, that we should have some Japanese food one evening\nand we found a restaurant that served Thai, Chinese and Japanese cuisines. We ordered a number of\nentr\u00e9es, including some sushi and sashimi. They served wasabi with the sushi and also gave us some\nbread rolls to go with the other starters.\nI asked Yuvi if he liked wasabi and he swore that he did. To our amazement, he then proceeded to\nspread the hot wasabi on a roll as if it was butter and was just about to pop it in his mouth when I\nstopped him. Zaheer was kicking me under the table, telling me to let him eat it, just to see what\nhappened. The wasabi was very strong, though, and there is no doubt that if he had eaten that roll he\nwould have been in serious trouble!\nWe forced Yuvi to admit that he had never tried wasabi before and we ribbed him mercilessly,\nthough he tried to put on a brave face.\n\nIndia in England, July\u2013August \nAfter the Ireland tour we went to England for a series of Tests and ODIs. The first Test started on \nJuly  and I have to say we were fortunate to avoid defeat after Michael Vaughan\u2019s England had\nput themselves in a good position. Anderson and Sidebottom had taken nine wickets between them as\nwe were dismissed for  in our first innings, and Kevin Pietersen\u2019s spectacular  had helped to set\nus a target of  in our second innings. On the last day of the match we were nine wickets down and\nstruggling when Steve Bucknor ruled Sreesanth not out, even though it appeared that he had been hit\nright in front of middle stump. The match was stopped shortly afterwards because of rain and it was a\nlucky escape.\n\n\fWe played much better in the second Test at Nottingham a week later, and on the first day, which\nwas also curtailed because of rain, we took control. We dismissed England for under , thanks to\nexcellent bowling from Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble, with good support from RP Singh and\nSreesanth, and followed up with a total of . Five out of our top six batsmen passed  without\ngoing on to make a century. I contributed  before being given out lbw by Simon Taufel. He later\ncame to see me to admit that it had been a mistake on his part and that he had seen from replays that\nthe ball was clearly missing the stumps. It added to my respect for Simon and we are still good friends\ntoday.\nOur innings was tinged with controversy when Zaheer Khan had an unusual welcome to the middle.\nWhen he reached the wicket, Zaheer saw several jelly beans sprinkled on the crease. Clearly it was a\nprank by one of the England players. Zaheer removed the jelly beans but they reappeared as soon as he\nwas back on strike. Zaheer directed a few words at Kevin Pietersen at gully \u2013 though it was never clear\nwho was actually involved \u2013 and when he came back to the pavilion he was furious. He shouted to the\nteam that we needed to play aggressive cricket and finish England off in the second innings. Zaheer is\nnormally a cool guy and he very rarely gets angry. It was a blessing in disguise for us, as Zaheer\nbacked up his words with one of his best ever spells in Test cricket, taking five wickets and leading us\nto a famous victory. We went on to win the Test series \u2013 and the recovery that had started in\nBangladesh was complete.\nWe celebrated heartily, in which we were greatly helped by Rajiv Shukla, our manager for this tour.\nRajiv was a positive presence throughout the tour, and had been part of the team in some of our most\ncrucial away victories, including the NatWest tri-series win in . On that occasion he took the\nentire team out to dinner at the Four Seasons to celebrate the victory and also organized a special\nperformance of the musical Bombay Dreams, something we very much enjoyed.\nWe were playing some very good cricket by now and were looking forward to taking on Australia in\nOctober  in a series of ODIs in India before heading Down Under for a full tour a couple of\nmonths later. Before that ODI series, however, Indian cricket received a huge fillip when we won the\ninaugural World Twenty in South Africa in September under MS Dhoni. I was not part of the\nTwenty team, of course, but I watched the team\u2019s progress with great interest. The Twenty win\nhelped restore the nation\u2019s passion for cricket and the players received a hero\u2019s welcome on their\nreturn to India.\n\nIndia in Australia, December \u2013January \nIndia\u2019s tour to Australia in \u2013 was perhaps the most eventful series of my career. While we had\ncome close to beating Australia in \u2013, drawing the series one apiece and dominating the last\nTest in Sydney, we played even better in \u2013. Even though the Test series is still talked about\nbecause of an incident involving Andrew Symonds and Harbhajan Singh in Sydney, a lot of other\nissues combined to make it an extremely intense couple of months.\nWe were full of confidence by the time we set off for Australia. After the series of ODIs in India in\nOctober, which Australia won \u2013, we had played Pakistan at home in November and early December\n and won the three-Test series \u2013. Most of the batsmen were in good form and we were hopeful\nof achieving our first ever series win Down Under. Unfortunately, before the first Test at the MCG\nthere was only one warm-up game, as is often the case with scheduling these days, and even that was a\nnear washout because of a storm, which meant we had very little chance to adjust to Australian\nconditions.\n\n\fFirst Test, Melbourne, \u2013 December \nWe had a reasonable first day at the MCG, picking up nine Australian wickets, and we quickly\nfinished off their innings the next morning for . Anil and Zaheer had bowled well and now it was\ndown to the batsmen. I came in with the score at \u2013.\nI had thought carefully about the way I would approach my innings and had a plan for each\nAustralian bowler. In fact, a glance at my scoring chart for the series will show up where I played the\nbig shots: I really went after the bowling in the area between long on and midwicket. This was based\non my experience of playing the Australian attack in the one-dayers in India a couple of months\nbefore, when the left-arm chinaman bowler Brad Hogg had caused us problems. I was determined to\nattack him because I knew it would force the Australians to rethink their plans. If they couldn\u2019t rely on\nHogg, the fast bowlers would have to bowl longer spells than expected and we could attack them when\nthey got tired in the hot and testing conditions. I went into the Melbourne Test with a set plan against\nHogg. However, once in the middle, I realized that I needed to play differently and changed my plan\non the ground itself. Looking at his field placements, I started taking the aerial route and hit him in the\narea between deep midwicket and long on, forcing him to change his game plan and remove the closecatching fielders. This strategy paid off and I could subsequently milk singles, with no men close on\nthe leg side. For other bowlers, however, I stuck to the same game plan that I had originally decided.\nBrett Lee bowled at his best in this series. Back in  Lee had been fast but raw; in  he was\nthe complete package. He had real pace, a vicious bouncer, a yorker, a fast swinging delivery and also\na slower ball. He was consistently clocking  kph and I relished my contests with him. Among the\nother bowlers, Mitchell Johnson bowled some incisive spells, while the accurate Stuart Clark had the\njob of trying to keep things tight. To his credit, he also picked up some key wickets.\nI went after the bowling from the start of my innings. I was feeling good and was set to kick on for a\nbig score. However, you don\u2019t always get a hundred just because you\u2019re feeling good and I got out\nafter scoring . We were all out for , which was nowhere near enough. Australia soon managed to\nestablish a stranglehold over us, eventually winning the Test in four days. It was not the start we had\nhoped for.\n\nRed faces all round\nSomething unexpected that I had to deal with at the time of the Melbourne Test was a severe allergic\nreaction. On our way to Australia, Harbhajan Singh and I had bought a newly launched moisturizing\ncream at Singapore airport and for the first few days I had no problems using the cream. It was during\nthe first Test that I started feeling a serious burning sensation on my face. Harbhajan did not have any\nsuch problem, so at first I attributed my reaction to a massage. I had had to lie down with my face on a\ntowel and I thought it must have been something to do with the detergent used on the towel.\nThe problem started to bother me on the third day and I remember putting more cream on my face\nbefore going to bed, thinking it would help. The next morning I awoke in agony. My face was on fire\nand it was as if someone had pushed it into a barbecue. It was even worse by the evening with my face\nall red and swollen. So much so that I was too embarrassed to go out in public and had to hide behind\nlarge sunglasses.\nAnjali was arriving in Sydney the next day. With the Melbourne Test over on the fourth day, I got\npermission to fly to Sydney a little earlier than planned and met up with her and the children at the\nairport. They were horrified by my face and asked what on earth I had done to it. I was not in the best\n\n\fof moods and wanted to get to the hotel as quickly as possible. When we finally arrived, after a fortyfive-minute drive because of the traffic, I was really irritable. The hotel staff then took a long time to\ngive us our rooms and I ended up shouting at the hotel manager. By the time we got to the room I had\nstarted to feel worse and told Anjali to ask the kids to sit in the adjoining room and leave me alone.\nThe poor kids were wondering what was wrong with me to behave like this. By then, my face was\ntroubling me even more. We called Reception and asked for a doctor to come to my room but were\ntold that there wasn\u2019t one available at that hour. I asked where the nearest hospital was and went there\nimmediately. After a brief examination, I was given a lotion for the night and was asked to come back\nthe following morning.\nWe got a taxi from the hospital and after a few minutes the driver said to me in Hindi, \u2018 Aap wohi ho\njo main samaj raha hoon.\u2019 (I think you are the person I think you are.) I admitted that I was and he\noffered to show us around Sydney, which I was in no mood to do. I asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind\ntaking us to a fast-food place instead and Anjali got out to get some burgers for dinner while I waited\nin the cab. The driver accompanied her and when they returned she told me that he had insisted on\npaying for the food. He also refused to take any money from us after dropping us off at the hotel and\nleft his number in case we needed to go anywhere else in Sydney during our stay. I was very touched\nby the gesture and told him that I would leave match tickets for him at Reception. Later I got one of\nmy Test shirts signed by the team and left it with the tickets.\nI returned to the hospital the following morning and asked the doctor to do whatever he thought\nnecessary to give me some quick relief, as I had a Test match to play the following morning. The\ndoctor was a little taken aback, considering my condition, but I was absolutely determined to play.\nThat afternoon we were supposed to be practising but I was in no state to stay out in the sun. I ended\nup batting against my dear friend Subroto Banerjee, the former India medium-fast bowler, who was\nthen a resident of Sydney, in the indoor nets for a good forty-five minutes. I managed to take the field\nthe next day, however, and that was the first time I wore a floppy white hat, which from then on\nbecame my trademark on the field. I applied a lot of ice to my face and then plastered it with zinc\ncream. It looked ridiculous but that didn\u2019t bother me.\nAfter a couple of days, it finally started to settle down and I looked almost human again.\n\nSecond Test, Sydney, \u2013 January \nWe suffered a blow on the eve of the Sydney Test when Zaheer was forced to return to India with a\nheel injury. Someone\u2019s loss is always another person\u2019s gain, however, and Zaheer\u2019s return meant\nyoung Ishant Sharma would get an opportunity to play in Australia for the first time.\nOn the first day, we started well and soon had the Australians on the ropes, with six wickets gone\nfor only , four of which were taken by RP Singh. Just when we seemed to be in control and were\ntrying to press home the advantage, what seemed to us to be an error by umpire Steve Bucknor caused\na shift in momentum. Andrew Symonds was ruled not out after he had very clearly edged the ball to\nDhoni off Ishant \u2013 the sound was heard not just by the players but also by the spectators. My son heard\nthe sound of the edge sitting in the stands and reminds me whenever we discuss the Sydney Test\nmatch. Symonds stood his ground and, riding his luck, got a very important century for Australia. His\n changed the course of the game and Australia managed to put together a total of  after being in\na lot of trouble. That wasn\u2019t their only piece of luck, though. Even before Symonds had been given\nthis reprieve, Ricky Ponting had been adjudged not out by umpire Mark Benson after he seemed to\nedge a ball down the leg side.\n\n\fThe best response was to go out and make some runs. I was glad to make amends for missing out in\nMelbourne by making , and it was a delight to watch Laxman score a hundred at the other end,\nwith Rahul and Sourav also chipping in with half-centuries. But just when the momentum seemed to\nbe swinging our way, Andrew Symonds started swearing at Harbhajan, who was batting with me and\nplaying really well.\nBhajji had gone past  when it all started. For a number of overs he had been telling me that\nAndrew Symonds was trying to get him riled. I asked Bhajji not to rise to it but to continue batting the\nway he was. I knew only too well that by retaliating he would just play into the Australians\u2019 hands.\nThe best thing to do is to ignore such provocation. That\u2019s easy enough to say, but of course it\u2019s not\nalways so easy to keep your cool at moments of intense pressure.\nBhajji was doing his best and was actually trying to be civil with some of the Australian players,\nincluding Brett Lee, when all hell broke loose. Bhajji had playfully tapped Lee on the back after\ncompleting a run and Symonds at mid off took exception to this. He apparently did not want an\nopposition player meddling with Lee and once again hurled abuse at Bhajji. Bhajji is an impulsive and\npassionate individual and it was only a matter of time before he would retaliate, which he soon did.\nThat was the start of the controversy that almost caused the tour to be called off.\nI want to state very clearly that the incident arose because Andrew Symonds had been continually\ntrying to provoke Bhajji and it was inevitable that the two would have an altercation at some point.\nWhile walking up to Bhajji to try to calm things down, I heard him say \u2018Teri maa ki\u2019 (Your mother \u2026)\nto Symonds. It is an expression we often use in north India to vent our anger and to me it was all part\nof the game. In fact, I was surprised to see umpire Mark Benson go up to Bhajji and speak to him.\nWhile the umpire was talking to Bhajji, some of the Australian players started to warn him of the dire\nconsequences of his words, presumably to rattle him and disturb his concentration. The ploy paid off\nwhen a few overs later Bhajji was out for .\nI thought the matter had ended with Bhajji\u2019s dismissal and later I was surprised when I was told that\nthe Australians had lodged a formal complaint at the end of that day\u2019s play, apparently alleging that\nBhajji had called Symonds a \u2018monkey\u2019, which was being treated as a racial insult. What surprised me\nmost was the haste with which the Australians had lodged their complaint. I was later informed that it\nhad apparently been agreed between the Australian and Indian boards during their tour of India in\nOctober , following an incident in Mumbai, that the respective captains were to report to the\nmatch referee any incident with a racial element. Even so, I still believe that the matter would not\nhave been blown so out of proportion if Ponting had discussed it with the captain Anil Kumble,\nHarbhajan and the Indian team management before reporting the incident to Mike Procter, the match\nreferee. In turn, Mike Procter could also have handled the matter with a little more sensitivity.\nSoon after the end of play on the third day we were informed by Mike Procter that there would be a\nformal hearing on the incident at the end of the fourth day, which was later changed to the end of the\nmatch. It did not leave us in the best frame of mind in the middle of an intense contest. While it was\ndistressing to hear that Symonds felt he had been racially abused, it was equally distressing to observe\nwhat Bhajji was going through. As far as we were concerned, he had retaliated in the face of\nprovocation, which was par for the course in an Australia\u2013India cricket match. But he did not racially\nabuse another cricketer.\nWith the controversy overshadowing everything, the Test match assumed a completely different\ncharacter. By the fifth day we were batting to save the game. Mind you, there is little doubt in my\nmind that we would have drawn had it not been for what seemed to us to be mistakes by the umpires\nand some rather unsportsmanlike conduct by a few of the Australian players.\n\n\fRahul Dravid was given out caught behind off Symonds for  by umpire Bucknor when his bat\nseemed to be a fair distance away from the ball. The wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist was standing up to\nthe stumps at the time and was in the best position to see if the ball had touched Rahul\u2019s bat. Yet he\nwho prided himself on walking off if he nicked the ball appealed for the caught-behind and to our\ndisbelief we saw the umpire raise the finger. It was a shocking decision. Some of us actually wondered\nif Rahul had been given out lbw.\nA few overs later, Sourav was given out by umpire Benson after Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting\ndecided to appeal for what we thought was a grassed catch at slip. Finally, umpire Bucknor gave\nDhoni out leg-before when to us the ball would clearly have missed the stumps. It seemed that every\ndecision that could go against us had done so.\nAfter the Test had ended with an Australian victory in the dying minutes of the fifth day, the Indian\nteam were instructed to stay behind at the ground for the Bhajji hearing. Despite this, however, I was\nthe first person to go out and congratulate the Australians, regardless of all the controversy and\ndisappointment. In those circumstances, to have to hang around in order to testify on an important\nincident like that wasn\u2019t ideal, to say the least.\nThe hearing was conducted rather strangely, it seemed to me, with the Australians and Indians\nasked to testify separately, without the other side being present in the room. This certainly didn\u2019t\nimprove the trust between the Indian and Australian players. I was the principal witness because I was\nbatting at the other end from Bhajji and I recounted the incident to the match referee in detail. Apart\nfrom Bhajji himself, Chetan Chauhan, our manager on this tour, MV Sridhar, the media manager, and\nAnil Kumble, the captain, were also called.\nMike Procter did not look very convinced by our version of events and we found it surprising that\nhe asked us to wait in our dressing room till well past midnight. In fact, it was not until  a.m. that we\nwere allowed to return to our hotel. The controversy had started to cast a pall over the series. After the\nhearing there was serious ill-feeling between the two teams and we felt betrayed by the turn of events.\n\nStanding up for justice\nWe were preparing to travel to Canberra the day after the Sydney Test to play a first-class fixture\nwhen we heard that Bhajji had been banned for three matches. We had had enough. It was just not\nacceptable and we decided it was time to take a stand against the judgement. We did not agree with\nwhat the referee had done and felt that the hearing at Sydney had been something of a farce. We\ninformed the BCCI of the players\u2019 feelings and held a team meeting to decide what to do about it.\nAnil Kumble and I took the lead and it was unanimously decided that we would boycott the tour if\nBhajji\u2019s ban was upheld. Anil is one of the politest cricketers I have known but he is also very strongminded. I have great admiration for the role he played as captain during this controversy. We decided\nto lodge an appeal against the ban and, in a gesture of protest, we also decided not to travel to\nCanberra \u2013 even though we had already loaded all our cricket gear into the bus. It was time for stern\nwords and strong action.\nThe BCCI was behind us all the way and duly lodged a formal appeal contesting the ban. Mr VR\nManohar, one of India\u2019s legal luminaries, was handling our case. We had regular conversations with\nhim and provided him with all the relevant details. I must reiterate that we were very serious about the\nboycott. If Bhajji\u2019s ban was upheld, it would mean an acceptance of guilt and imply that Bhajji had\nracially abused Symonds, which he most certainly had not. We were fully prepared to accept the\nconsequences of walking out of a tour, knowing that such an action might have resulted in the ICC\n\n\fbanning the Indian team. The issue was now bigger than just Bhajji. Indians all over the world felt\nslighted and we felt it was our responsibility to stand up for our cause.\nHaving made our decision, we needed to find some way of reducing the tension. In the end we went\nto Bondi Beach and played a game of volleyball. It had a magical effect. It served as a fantastic teambonding session and helped give us the determination to carry on. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the media\nfollowed us wherever we went, particularly Bhajji. On a lighter note, I remember saying to him that he\nmust be the second most popular man in the world after Michael Jackson, with so many cameras\nfollowing him. In fact, I called him MJ for some time during and after the controversy.\n\nThird Test, Perth, \u2013 January \nOnce we had lodged our appeal, we agreed to go to Perth for the third Test. On the eve of the match\nthe ICC had flown in Ranjan Madugalle, its senior match referee, in an attempt to defuse the\nsimmering tension between the two teams. A meeting was staged between the two captains at the\nHyatt Hotel in Ranjan\u2019s presence and Anil and Ricky shook hands for the cameras. In reality nothing\nhad changed. The unpleasantness of Sydney would not go away and a number of issues remained to be\nstraightened out at the WACA, where India had never won a Test.\nThe Perth Test turned out to be one of the best Test matches I was involved in. There is little doubt\nin my mind that the controversy had brought us together as a team. Sehwag was back and he gave us a\nquick start against Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Tait and Stuart Clark on the first morning,\nhelping us to win the first skirmish. He only scored  but it was enough to set the foundation for the\nmiddle order. Rahul and I then put together a very important partnership of .\nIt was in this innings that I had one of my toughest contests with Brett Lee. He bowled at real pace\nand I had to be at my best. I hadn\u2019t been in long when Lee bowled a fast bouncer. The shot I played\nstill gives me a lot of satisfaction. I readied myself to play the upper cut over the slips, but then I\nrealized that the ball was jagging back at me at furious pace. Within a fraction of a second the ball was\njust inches away from my head. I kept my eyes on the ball and was leaning back at almost  degrees\nwhen I finally met the ball with the bat right in front of my eyes. The ball flew over the\nwicketkeeper\u2019s head to the boundary. After that, I had a feeling it was going to be a good day. I went\non to make  in our score of , with Dravid contributing .\nAnil picked up his th Test wicket in Australia\u2019s first innings when he had Symonds caught by\nRahul at slips. Anil\u2019s uncharacteristically exuberant celebration was an eye-opener for all of us and\nshowed how much the wicket meant to the team after the Sydney Test. Breaking the partnership\nbetween Symonds and Gilchrist proved crucial. We went on to bowl Australia out for , with RP\nSingh taking four wickets, giving us a -run lead. We had set Australia a target of  and were\nbeginning to scent victory. But there was still a job to be done and there was no room for\ncomplacency.\nThe final day was a classic piece of Test cricket. In fact, Ishant Sharma\u2019s spell of fast bowling that\nmorning was one of the best spells by an Indian bowler in all my years of international cricket.\nPonting and Michael Hussey came in intent on staging a fightback after Irfan Pathan had picked up the\ntwo openers the previous evening. Anil had set a good field to Ponting and Ishant was given the ball. It\nwas inspiring to see an Indian fast bowler bowl at real pace to one of the world\u2019s premier batsmen and\nmesmerize him with balls that came in from a good length.\nThe length Ishant was hitting was the key. I was standing at mid on and kept reminding him to bowl\nthe same line and length over and over again. There was no need for anything fancy, as he already had\n\n\fPonting in some difficulty. I could also sense Ponting trying to upset Ishant by threatening to come\nforward, to force him to alter his length. It was a true test between bat and ball and I was impressed to\nsee Ishant stick to doing exactly what had been asked of him.\nBy the end of eight overs Ishant showed no reduction in pace. He had beaten Ponting on numerous\noccasions but somehow the batsman had survived. It was an important moment. If he managed to play\nIshant off, Ponting would be able to relax and we would have missed an opportunity. Anil, however,\nwas tempted to give Ishant a rest \u2013 until some of the senior players persuaded him to allow Ishant one\nmore go at Ponting.\nThe gamble paid off and Ishant finally got Ponting to edge one to Rahul at slip. It was a just reward\nfor a great piece of fast bowling. We had our man and could now have a crack at the Australian middle\norder. We kept taking wickets at regular intervals and in the end it was the left-arm seamer RP Singh\nwho clean-bowled Stuart Clark to give us an amazing victory.\n\nReasons to be cheerful\nAfter the game a number of bottles of champagne were opened in the dressing room and one was also\nsent across to the touring Indian media contingent, who had played a very important role in standing\nbehind us during the Sydney controversy. I\u2019m pleased to say that Brett Lee and Adam Gilchrist also\ncame to our dressing room to congratulate us and it was a gesture that was much appreciated.\nAs I look back at the Perth Test a few things stand out. We arrived in Perth with a sense of purpose.\nWe all felt hurt by what had transpired in Sydney and the best way to vent our anger was on the cricket\nfield. And that is what we did.\nThe second thing I remember about Perth is the arrival of Gary Kirsten, who had been nominated as\ncoach of India but who was yet to take charge. Gary did not say much at first and just wanted to\nobserve how the Indian players went about their routines. It was Gary who suggested that the team\nshould go cycling in Perth, to get our minds off cricket for a while. It certainly did us a lot of good. At\nsuch times net practice is not always the only answer. No one will ever become a Sunil Gavaskar or a\nKapil Dev in two days of practice. It is just as important to recharge mentally and it often helps to\nspend some time together away from the cricket field.\nFinally, the support of the fans was particularly memorable. We were \u2013 down in the series and a\nlot had been written about the fragility of the team on the fast and bouncy WACA track. None of this\ngloomy talk stopped the Indian fans from coming and lending their support. It was terrific to see the\ntricolour being waved in the stands and it was a reminder of what the game meant to Indians all round\nthe world. It felt good to have made them proud.\nWe had proved that the Indian team could play within the spirit of the game both on and off the\nfield.\n\nFourth Test, Adelaide, \u2013 January \nAs we prepared for the final Test at Adelaide, Gary asked me if I wanted to bat in the nets and I said\nI\u2019d prefer to practise to some short-pitched throw-downs. This was the start of a ritual that continued\nfor four years, with Gary throwing hundreds of balls to me before every game. He never seemed to get\ntired and his commitment to the job was amazing.\nWhen he asked me at Adelaide if I wanted to practise against short throw-downs, I asked him to\nthrow full and fast at me, because I had a feeling Brett Lee would bowl a full-length delivery the\n\n\fmoment I went in, as he had got me out with a full delivery at Perth. Sure enough, as soon as I walked\nout to bat at the Adelaide Oval, Lee bowled a delivery at my pads. I was prepared and instead of\nplaying square, which perhaps he was expecting me to do, I played a straight drive past the umpire for\nfour. After the stroke I looked towards Gary in our dressing room.\nI went on to score  and we put more than  runs on the board, with Sehwag and Bhajji both\nscoring  and Kumble playing a captain\u2019s innings down the order of . Australia batted just as well\nin response, with Hayden, Ponting and Clarke all making hundreds, and the match ended in a draw \u2013\nbut only after Sehwag had added an impressive  in our second innings. We had not managed to\nlevel the series but we had won back credibility and respect.\n\nThe final verdict\nBefore bringing down the curtain on the controversial \u2018Monkeygate\u2019 saga, as it had been dubbed in the\npress, Justice John Hansen heard everybody\u2019s evidence in the appeal on  January . I stated\nexactly what I had heard and seen and also said that I had taken exception to us being labelled \u2018liars\u2019\nby the match referee, Mike Procter, who had mentioned in his statement that \u2018I believe one group is\ntelling the truth\u2019. That he banned Bhajji for three Test matches seemed to us to show which group, in\nhis opinion, was lying. It is never a pleasant thing to be called a liar and I was extremely angry.\nIn the end justice prevailed. The verdict of the appeal was that there was no evidence to suggest the\nuse of a racist remark by Bhajji and the ban was lifted. Instead Bhajji was fined half of his match fee\nfor using abusive language against Symonds. Bhajji could finally breathe a sigh of relief and we as a\nteam felt vindicated.\nIndia in Bangladesh \nst Test.

A lot of the tension from the controversial Test series that preceded it was carried into\nthe limited-overs arena and the Indian team under new captain MS Dhoni were determined to return to\nIndia with the Commonwealth Bank trophy.\nThe pitch at the MCG on  February was one of the fastest I\u2019ve played on. We fielded first and\nDhoni was standing way back and still had to catch most balls at chest height. I was standing at slip,\nwhich was at the edge of the thirty-yard circle, an indication of the pace and bounce of the pitch. I\nremember mentioning to Dhoni, after an outside edge off Matthew Hayden\u2019s bat flew past me, that the\npitch was going to favour the fast bowlers throughout the match and no chase was going to be easy.\nOur bowlers used the conditions well and dismissed Australia for only . Ishant bowled\nbeautifully again to pick up \u2013 and Sreesanth also did well, taking \u2013. At the break our dressing\nroom was buoyant, though we knew that their fast bowlers would enjoy the conditions just as much.\nSure enough, in the third over of the innings Lee bowled a fast short ball that flew off the shoulder of\nmy bat over slip towards third man. Just as I was completing the single, Lee walked up to me and\ncasually said with a smile that he was feeling very good and was going to bowl really fast at me. Lee\nhas always been a good friend and while it wasn\u2019t exactly sledging, it was enough to fire me up. As he\nwalked past I just muttered to myself that, come what may, I was going to take him on. It turned out to\nbe one of our most memorable contests.\nMy chance came in the fifth over. Sehwag had just been dismissed at the other end, lbw to left-arm\nseamer Nathan Bracken for , and Lee was steaming in. His second ball was slightly wide but I still\ndecided to go for a drive through cover. I connected moderately well and the ball raced to the fence.\nLee just gave me another smile and walked back to his mark. I thought I knew what he would try next.\nHe ran in fast and, as anticipated, bowled a fuller-length ball. I came down hard at it and hit it straight\nback at him. It must have been one of the most powerful shots I have hit in my life. Lee didn\u2019t have a\nhope of bending down to stop the ball. In fact, the ball had reached the boundary by the time he\nfinished his follow-through.\nBy now Lee was even more pumped up and the next ball was a  kph delivery, which I defended\noff the back foot. I was determined to keep attacking and I got another opportunity off the fifth ball of\nthe over. It was full and fast and again I hit it back past Lee for four. While the first straight drive had\ngone to the left of the bowler, this one went to his right. Those two drives gave me a lot of confidence\nand I went on to make . When I got out in the twenty-sixth over we needed  runs and Rohit\nSharma and Dhoni played well to finish off the job.\nImmediately after the match, I started to feel some soreness in my adductors, the muscles in the\ngroin, and informed John Gloster about the problem. We took remedial steps but the pain refused to\ngo away and I was still feeling it when we played our last pool match against Sri Lanka on \n\n\fFebruary in Hobart. It was a game we had to win to qualify for the three-match final against Australia.\nSri Lanka scored , with Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar both taking four wickets, and when our\ninnings started I managed to connect well from the off and went on to make  as we knocked off the\nruns in thirty-three overs. It felt good to spend time out in the middle again after several low scores\nand I headed to Sydney for the first final relieved at having scored some runs.\nWhile I was looking forward to the finals, I was conscious that the pain in my adductors was getting\nworse after every practice session. I was having problems with running, twisting and even bending\ndown to pick up a ball. It reached a stage where in fielding practice I had to just stand at the stumps\nwhile my team-mates threw the ball in. With the final just a day away, painkillers were the only\nremedy.\n\nCB Series, first final, Sydney,  March \nBefore the finals, the atmosphere got a little heated again when Ricky Ponting declared that Australia\nwould have to play only the first two of the three finals, as that was all it would take to send India\npacking. His comments only added to our determination.\nAustralia batted first at the SCG after winning the toss. It\u2019s usually a sensible ploy to bat first in a\nbig final, because even a mediocre score can be made to look good in a must-win situation. Australia\nmade  on the day, with Matthew Hayden contributing , and we didn\u2019t think it was a bad total in\ngood bowling conditions.\nRobin Uthappa was opening the batting with me and our first task was to see off the new ball. We\nknew that if the team batted our full fifty overs, we should win the match, and I advised Robin to be\npatient and not to be aggressive early in the innings. Being a naturally attacking batsman, Robin was\nitching to play his shots and at one point I had to get a little angry with him, telling him not to do\nanything rash. We managed not to lose a wicket until the eleventh over, when Robin played his first\nbig pull shot to deep square leg, where Mike Hussey caught the ball low down. Robin might have\nscored only , but he had helped see off the new ball and we had put together a -run first-wicket\npartnership.\nI sensed that the match would be ours if we kept our nerve. Unfortunately for us, we lost Gautam\nGambhir and Yuvraj within a few overs and needed another partnership to rebuild the innings. Rohit\nSharma had come out to bat and I asked him to play straight and not try any fancy shots early on. He\nbatted brilliantly and soon we were in a position to grind down the opposition. Rohit finally got out to\nthe all-rounder James Hopes for , just after I had reached my century.\nDhoni came out next and we knocked off the  runs needed to finish the match quite easily in the\nend. The only scare was a beamer from Brett Lee that hit me on the side of my helmet grille and the\ntop of my left shoulder. The ball had slipped out of his hand and could very easily have injured me. I\nfelt a little dizzy and jokingly suggested to Lee that he would have to answer to my son Arjun when he\nnext went to Mumbai. Lee knew Arjun well and had spent some time with my family when we had\nfilmed a Boost commercial together. He apologized immediately and the matter was put to rest there\nand then. It was an accident, of course, but the shoulder felt sore and the area between shoulder and\nelbow turned black.\nIt was a very satisfying feeling to bat through the innings. It was a big match but we decided not to\ncelebrate too much because the second final in Brisbane was only a day away and we knew it was\ngoing to be tough because of the high humidity.\nI could not sleep a wink that night and ached all over. The pain in my groin had increased and I was\n\n\fstarting to get scared. The next morning I could barely walk and it was an ordeal boarding the earlymorning flight. In Brisbane I was given a long massage as soon as we reached the hotel. Seeing my\ncondition, Dhoni suggested that maybe I should miss the second final and play in the third if needed. I\nsaid to him that \u2018Sher jab gira hua hota hai use tabhi mar do\u2019 (When a tiger is down and out, just\nfinish it off. Don\u2019t give it a second chance.) He agreed with me that it would be better to close out the\ncompetition in Brisbane if we could.\n\nCB Series, second final, Brisbane,  March \nWhen we arrived at the Gabba we found that there was a lot of moisture in the pitch. It was bound to\nbe difficult for batting early on and the obvious plan was to field first if we won the toss \u2013 but I urged\nDhoni not to do so. I reckoned that the Australians might well want to bat first, preferring to bat\nwithout the pressure of chasing a target. I thought it would be better if we set a target, even if it meant\nstruggling through the initial period of dampness on the wicket.\nDhoni agreed and we batted first. Again, I told Robin Uthappa in no uncertain terms not to risk a\nsingle expansive shot till we had played out the first ten overs. In those conditions not losing wickets\nwas far more important than trying to score runs. Robin successfully held back and we survived the\nfirst twenty overs intact, giving us a solid foundation to launch an assault. We then scored at almost\nsix runs an over and ended up with , a reasonable score to defend in the circumstances.\nI was pleased to score , but by the end of the innings I also knew that my body was in bad shape\nand if we weren\u2019t able to win in Brisbane I would be in no condition to play the third final. In fact, I\nwas forced to leave the field in the fourth over of the Australia innings, when Dhoni dived to catch\nHayden off Sreesanth and the ball ricocheted and hit me exactly where I had been hit by the Lee\nbeamer.\nMeanwhile our opening bowler Praveen Kumar produced a great spell and picked up three crucial\nAustralian wickets. Hayden and Symonds then put together a big partnership and the stage was set for\nBhajji to have the final word on Australian soil. First he ran Hayden out, following a\nmisunderstanding with Symonds, and then just two balls later Symonds missed a ball that turned a\nlong way and was trapped lbw. Unsurprisingly, Bhajji enjoyed his wicket more than any other.\nThe match wasn\u2019t over yet, however, with James Hopes playing some aggressive strokes. In the end,\nHopes was out last, for , but by picking up wickets regularly at the other end we had ensured that he\nwas constantly under pressure. Nevertheless, the match was closer than expected and when the final\nwicket fell, Australia were only ten runs away from winning the game.\nIt was a great feeling to win, and seeing the tricolour being waved all over the Gabba was a terrific\nsight. We had beaten Australia in Australia and were also delighted to have proved Ricky Ponting\nright. He did not have to play a third final, just as he had predicted.\n\nGrasping the nettle\nMy physical condition was deteriorating by the day. It didn\u2019t help that the problem still hadn\u2019t been\ndiagnosed properly and I didn\u2019t know exactly what I was suffering from. In any case, there wasn\u2019t\nmuch time to do anything about it as the first of three home Tests against South Africa was due to\nstart at Chennai a couple of weeks later, on  March .\nAfter getting as much rest as I could, I went to Chennai, and in the evening before the game had\nthree injections in my groin. The doctors sounded confident that they would enable me to play the next\n\n\fday. When I got up the following morning the pain was substantially reduced, but John Gloster and I\ndecided I should undertake a fitness test. I found I was able to run around during practice and also\nplayed our customary game of football without feeling too much discomfort. John declared me fit to\nplay.\nIt was unlucky for me that South Africa won the toss and then batted for two long days as they\ncompiled , with Amla making . Fielding in the heat quickly brought back the pain and when I\nfinally batted on the fourth day I was so stiff and sore that I got out without scoring to Makhaya Ntini,\ncaught by Kallis at second slip. At the end of the match, which was a high-scoring draw, I told Anil\nKumble and John Gloster that there was no point in pushing my body any further.\nI flew back to Mumbai and embarked on a process of rehabilitation under Nitin Patel, the physio of\nthe Mumbai Indians, the IPL team of which I had been made captain. The first season of the IPL was\njust round the corner and my initial aim was to get fit for the first match. Despite all my efforts,\nhowever, I was only able to play the last seven matches, and even then I was not  per cent fit.\nThe lack of a diagnosis led to some unhelpful speculation. Apparently, one doctor in Mumbai\nsuggested to a member of the Mumbai Indians management that the problem was actually in my head.\nI found out about it because one night Anjali asked me if the problem was really bad enough for me\nnot to play. How could Anjali ask me such a question? I said to her that I had played with broken\nfingers and toes, and played days after my father\u2019s death, so how could she of all people doubt my\nphysical condition? It was not until the competition had finished that Anjali told me what she had\nheard from a Mumbai Indians official about what the doctor had said. Frankly, I was shocked, but I\nwas also glad she didn\u2019t tell me until the end of the tournament, because I was trying everything\npossible to get fit and play, and it would have been very upsetting to hear that.\nUnfortunately for me, no one in Mumbai could diagnose the problem, despite the fact that I\u2019d\nundertaken various forms of treatment. Finally, it was in London, when I was there for a family\nholiday, that I met up with my surgeon Andrew Wallace and explained my condition. He\nrecommended Prof. Cathy Speed, who, on seeing the case history, immediately identified my problem\nas Gilmore\u2019s Groin, or Sportsman\u2019s Hernia, and referred me to Dr Ulrike Muschaweck in Germany.\nProf. Speed also prescribed a few medicines and gave me some exercises to do and I felt in good\nenough shape to go to Sri Lanka with the team for the Test series in July and August . I managed\nto get through the series, which we lost \u2013, without too much trouble, but before the start of the oneday series it was apparent to me that I had to do something about the condition.\nOn  August , I left for Munich alone to get myself treated by Dr Muschaweck at the Munich\nHernia Centre. It was a great revelation for me to discover this very specialized centre for hernia\ntreatment. Dr Muschaweck was highly recommended by Prof. Speed. She has been specializing in\nhernia surgery for close to two decades and has developed some new repair techniques in recent years\nthat have considerably improved the recovery process. She immediately makes her patients feel at\nease and she was quick to assure me that there was no chance of recurrence once she had operated on\nme. To my delight she was proved right.\nI had the first operation on  August and must say the pain was perfectly bearable. I had asked Dr\nMuschaweck if both sides of the groin could be done on the same day but was told that it wasn\u2019t\nfeasible because there would be far too much pain. Anjali hadn\u2019t been able to accompany me initially\nbecause of Sara\u2019s examinations, but she joined me on the evening of the th and I underwent my\nsecond operation on the morning of the th. I had insisted on having the two operations on\nconsecutive days to cut down the recovery time, in the hope of getting fit for the Australian Test\nseries. This time the pain was excruciating. Cleaning myself was quite an ordeal because of the\n\n\fserious pain in my abdomen and I wasn\u2019t able to eat a thing. I was given a laxative and this, a sweet\nsugar syrup with a very nice taste, was the only thing I enjoyed having that night! I could hardly sleep\nwith all the pain and was looking forward to getting back home.\nIt was an important operation and one that helped prolong my cricket career. It also draws attention\nto the lack of specialized sports science centres in India at that time. While I could afford to go to\nMunich and get myself treated by the best experts in the world, for other Indian athletes it might not\nalways have been feasible.\nI certainly knew I\u2019d had a serious operation afterwards. I remember leaving the clinic on  August\nin a wheelchair because I felt dizzy every time I tried to stand. I also remember telling Anjali that I\nwas about to faint when standing at the check-in counter at the airport and Anjali rushing to help.\nAfter landing in Mumbai, my friend Faisal Momen picked me up and for the first time in my life I\nasked him to drive as slowly as possible. I was frantically monitoring the road and if I spotted a speed\nbump I would lift myself a little with my hands to avoid jarring my abdomen.\nAs soon as I got home Anjali told the kids that for the time being they wouldn\u2019t be able to give their\nfather a hug. At that time, Arjun used to like play-fighting with me and I had to show him the\nbandages to make him understand that I was just too unwell. It was a difficult time for us all. I had\nalready missed days and months of my children\u2019s childhood. Now I was finally at home with them all\nday but was unable to play with them.\nOnce I\u2019d got over the journey, I started the recovery process under the aegis of Paul Close and Paul\nChapman. I did not go out for three weeks during rehab, as I was so tired from all my training, which\nwould start at seven in the morning. I spent the second week of my rehab at the National Cricket\nAcademy, and my training included strengthening exercises, cardio, pool sessions, running \u2013 both\nstraight and sideways \u2013 specialized exercises with the Thera-Band, and a number of other drills. It\nwould end at around two thirty in the afternoon, following which I would just go home, have lunch and\nsleep for a few hours, completely exhausted.\nThe target I had set myself was to recover for the Test series against Australia that started in\nBangalore at the beginning of October . I knew it would be a race against time and I had a lot of\nhard work ahead of me. There were days when I would push myself so hard that by the evening I\nwould just collapse on the bed and had no strength left, then I would get up very early the next\nmorning and start my exercises all over again. Throughout this period, my group of friends, including\nAtul Ranade, Sameer Dighe and Jagdish Chavan, were always there to motivate me and would train\nwith me all day. Their presence was a great help and I remain ever indebted to them for their support.\n\nAustralia in India, October\u2013November \nIt was a great relief to be back on the field for the first Test against Australia in Bangalore on \nOctober. Australia made  in their first innings, with Ponting and Hussey both making hundreds,\nand we made  in reply. I scored only  in my first innings, but did better in the second innings\nbefore falling to the leg-spin of Cameron White. I scored  but, more importantly, I was able to bat\nfor close to three hours and faced more than a hundred balls without feeling discomfort. The match\nwas drawn and we headed to Mohali for the second of the four Tests.\nThe series had assumed greater significance because Sourav had announced that he would be\nretiring at the end of the fourth Test at Nagpur. Sourav and I always had a great rapport and we shared\na lot of great moments together. As teenagers, we both spent a month at an Under- camp and were\npart of Kailash Gattani\u2019s touring team to England. We played together for over a decade in Test\n\n\fcricket and opened the batting for India in countless limited-overs international matches.\nOne of the habits that we got into was that every time I felt that Sourav was tense or that there was\nsomething troubling him, I would say something random to him in Bengali, which is his mother\ntongue. Often my words made little sense but they were good enough to make him laugh. There was\nno doubt I was going to miss him. I remember trying to persuade him to carry on, but he was sure it\nwas time to call it a day.\nIn the second Test at Mohali, starting on  October, I scored a fluent  in our total of  before\nfalling to Peter Siddle, caught at slip. My timing was definitely coming back. In the process I passed\nBrian Lara\u2019s tally and reached the figure of , Test runs. This achievement was marked by a\nfantastic fireworks display at the ground. It went on for close to three minutes and I felt privileged and\nhonoured at the affection heaped on me. Mr Inderjit Singh Bindra, one of Indian cricket\u2019s most\ndistinguished administrators, who was then president of the Punjab Cricket Association, told me that\nthere were more fireworks than the total number of runs I had scored. I felt overwhelmed. The PCA\nhas always been a great host and is an institution that has made playing in Punjab that much more\nspecial.\nFrom the start of Australia\u2019s first innings, our bowlers were bowling really good lines and managed\nto put the Australian batsman under pressure. The ball was reverse-swinging and both Zaheer Khan\nand Ishant Sharma were making the most of the conditions. In contrast, the Australian bowlers had\nfound it difficult to get their rhythm right and Gambhir, Sehwag and Dhoni had all made big scores\nagainst them.\nTo everyone\u2019s delight, Sourav scored a hundred in the first innings. I couldn\u2019t have been happier for\nhim and remember how he celebrated what was to be his final Test hundred with a pump of his fist\nand then raised his arms to acknowledge the well-deserved applause.\nThe Mohali match is also memorable for me because of the catch I took in the Australian second\ninnings. I was fielding at point when Simon Katich tried to cut Bhajji past me for four. He mistimed\nthe shot and I had to dive forward to reach the ball. I managed to get both hands under it and it was\ngreat to feel the leather on my hands. Such a quick reaction put quite a strain on my groin muscles, but\nI got up unhurt and the relief was evident on my face. My hard work during the recovery had paid off.\nIt was also an important breakthrough for us in the game and we were able to get into the Australian\nmiddle order sooner than expected. Zaheer and Ishant bowled exceptionally well and it was perhaps\nthe best I have seen Zaheer bowl. He was getting the ball to move late and the Australian batsmen\nstruggled against late swing. It\u2019s a shame Zaheer suffered so many injuries, otherwise I\u2019m sure we\nwould have seen his match-winning abilities on many more occasions.\nWe beat the Australians at Mohali by  runs and moved to Delhi for the third Test on  October\nleading the four-match contest \u2013. There we managed to keep the momentum going and were happy\nwith a draw, thanks mainly to double hundreds in the first innings by both Gautam Gambhir and\nLaxman. I scored  and felt comfortable enough to believe that a big score wasn\u2019t far away; I just had\nto be patient.\nThat Delhi Test turned out to be Anil Kumble\u2019s last and it was an extremely emotional moment for\nus all. Anil was one of the biggest match-winners India has produced and we had played together for\nclose to two decades. I was very surprised when he said he was thinking of retiring. He felt he was not\nbowling close to his best and was not able to give  per cent for the team. My argument was simple.\nEven  per cent of Anil Kumble was good enough for most batsmen and India still needed him.\nI almost managed to persuade him to carry on but an injury to his spinning finger on the third day of\nthe Test was the final straw. He had just recovered from a shoulder surgery and with the finger injury,\n\n\fwhich required eleven stitches, he simply couldn\u2019t bowl. We carried him on our shoulders and it was a\nfitting finale for one of international cricket\u2019s true all-time greats.\nHis final speech was very emotional for all of us and the crowd gave him a standing ovation. I\u2019m\nglad to say we managed to convince Anil to come to Nagpur for the last Test to be a part of the\ncelebration if India went on to win the series. It was only right that Anil should be there, because he\nhad captained us in two of the first three Tests and had also been the captain when we played in\nAustralia earlier in the year.\nWe started well at Nagpur on  November, with an opening partnership of close to a hundred by\nSehwag and Vijay, but then lost two quick wickets. I managed to build decent partnerships with\nLaxman and Sourav, with a number of lucky breaks going my way. I was dropped in the eighties and\nnineties and I told Sourav that God wanted me to score a century on the occasion of Sourav\u2019s farewell\nTest match.\nIn his final Test Sourav scored a valuable  for the team. We managed  in our first innings but\nI still felt we were  runs short. It was a good batting wicket and the Australians raced on in the last\nsession of day two to finish at \u2013. We knew we could not afford to let them get away the next\nmorning. We had to try something different to make them think and take some risks, because they\nwere the ones under pressure to level the series. I suggested to Dhoni that we needed to slow down the\ngame, and after that we employed an \u2013 field, with eight fielders on the off side and one on the on,\nsomething hardly ever tried in Test cricket, to Michael Hussey and Simon Katich, and despite\ndropping Katich early on we managed to restrict the runs. Zaheer and Ishant bowled well to the field\nand Australia just could not get away.\nThey added only  runs before lunch and Ishant also dismissed Simon Katich in the process. That\nwicket changed everything and we took a further three in the session between lunch and tea, conceding\njust  runs. The momentum had shifted and we knew we were back in control. We eventually set\nAustralia a target of  in their second innings, and then Amit Mishra, the leg-spinner who had\nreplaced Anil, and Harbhajan Singh finished things off midway through the second session on day five\nand we won the series \u2013.\nThe celebrations went on into the night and both Anil and Sourav were asked to give speeches.\nGary, who had played a huge role behind the scenes, had organized the farewell at the VCA Club in\nJamtha and it was a day everyone who was there will cherish for ever.
