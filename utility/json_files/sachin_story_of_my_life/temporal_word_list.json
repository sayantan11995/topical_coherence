    "1984-1988": " He was a natural cricketer.-Ramakant Achrekar\nIf the Kanga League is the heart and soul of Mumbai cricket, the\nHarris and Giles Shield inter-school tournaments are its roots. When\nSachin was growing up, the school scene was dominated by the likes\nofSharadashram Vidyamandir, Balamohan, St. Mary's, Don Bosco,\nSt. Xavier's and Anjuman-E-Islam.\nSharadashram has produced four Test cricketers-Chandrakant\nPandit, Pravin Arnre, Sachin Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli. By the\ns it had overtaken Anjuman-E-Islam as the winnet of the most\ninter-school tournament titles.\nPandit (a wicketkeeper-batsman) and Lalchand Rajput (opening\nbatsman) were in Ruia College with Ajit Tendulkar and were coached\nby Ramakant Achrekar, the official Sharadashram coach. Achrekar\nalso ran a few cricket clubs, including the Sassanian Cricket Club and\nthe Kamat Memorial Cricket Club for whom he kept wickets in\nKanga League matches well into his s.\nAchrekar never played first-class cricket. But for many years he\nwas the wicketkeeper-batsman for the strong State Bank oflndia team\nin the Times Shield which had in its ranks a future India captain and\ncoach, Ajit Wadekar.\nWe used to call him the Bradman of tennis-ball cricket, such was\nhis technique,' Wadekar told me in Mumbai in September .\nFor those who may scotT at the thought of playing cricket with a\ntennis ball, try it sometime. Keeping the ball on the ground is\ndevilishly difficult and reaching  runs is considered quite a feat.\n\n\f\\jit Tendulkar felt this was the ideal man to guide the early career\nof his little brother, who he was convinced had the spark in him to\nmake the big time. According to Ajit, Achrekar's biggest asset was the\nequal emphasis he laid on both net practice and match practice. The\ncoach ensured most of his boys were busy playing in one tournament\nor the other right through the year.\nAjit duly approached Achrekar 'Sir' (as he is respectfully referred\nto) and asked if he could bring his brother along for the net practice\nwhich Achrekar held for Kamat Club and the boys ofSharadashram\nat Shivaji Park. The coach, already well known in Mumbai cricket\ncircles, and soon to become a legend in the cricket world, agreed after\nfirst confirming that -year-old Sachin had never played with a hard\ncricket ball. Till then, it had been rubber-ball cricket for the little boy.\nOn the first day; Achrekar told Sachin to watch in order to get a feel\nof what playing with the 'big boys' would be like. 'For the first and so\nfar perhaps the only time in his cricket career, Sachinjust stood and\nwatched the others play,' remembers Ajit.\nOnce the batting was over Sachin did, however, get a chance to be\npart of the fielding drill. For the first time, he got the feel of a hard\ncricket ball. And Ajit, at least, was impressed. 'I realized once more he\nhad natural talent which should be nurtured.'\nI met Achrekar at his modest Dadar flat in September  to get\nhis first impressions of the boy who would be king. Achrekar, now in\nhis s, has slowed down after a stroke a couple of years ago. But he\nwas still rushing off to Shivaji Park for the daily coaching sessions.\nHis eyes lit up when I asked him about his most famous product.\n'Everything was just right. He was a natural cricketer. I did not have to\nchange much. By the time he was -, I knew he would make the\nbig time. Ifl told him something, he would be diligent and persevering.\nI would have to tell him something only once and he would stick to\nit.' Achrekar also emphasized that it was the Tendulkar family structure\nthat provided the bedrock for Sachin's career. 'His father was always\nbehind him and his brother Ajit would accompany him to the nets.\nThis was essential for the youngster.'\nOn the way home from that first session, Sachin told his brother\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fwith the same confidence with which he would handle the world's\nbest bowlers, 'I can bat better than any of them.'\nThe next day was the first batting session at the nets and though\nAchrekar did not express any opinion, he did invite him to continue\nhis practice sessions. Playing with a rubber ball meant Sachin resorted\nto cross-bat shots to cope with the exaggerated bounce. This led to an\noveremphasis on leg side play in the initial nets. But Ajit noticed his\n'uncanny ability'. to judge the length of the ball and middle it.\nLike all good coaches, Achrekar was loath to change the natural\nstyle of the youngster. He did, however, have a problem with Sachin's\nbatting grip, something he had acquired as a five-year-old when he\nplayed around with \\jit's bat. In order to grip a bat that was obviously\ntoo big for him, Sachin clutched it at the bottom of the handle, and the\nhabit stuck. The bottom-handed grip enabled him to hit strokes with\ngreat power. But Achrekar felt it affected his stance and would cause\nproblems as he grew taller. He tried to persuade Sachin to use the\northodox grip, holding the bat in the middle of the handle with both\nhands together. But Sachin felt uncomfortable with this new grip and\nfinally, Achrekar relented.\nSpeaking to me late in , Bishan Singh Bedi narrated an\nincident that occurred in New Zealand in , during Sachin's\nsecond tour. Bedi was the team's coach and was told by former New\nZealand batting great, Glenn Turner, that Tendulkar's grip was wrong.\n'Turner told me that as coach I should do something about it. But I\nrefused, as this was what had brought so many runs for Sachin at such\na young age.'\nTwo weeks at the nets and Achrekar invited the youngster to play\nhis first organized match, a -overs match between two teams made\nup of his wards. He had fixed Sachin's place as number four in the\nbatting line-up. The first two matches produced ducks. (So would his\nfirst two One-day Internationals [oms] in .) But those early\nfailures did not faze Sachin one bit. And soon, the runs began to flow.\n\\jit remembers scores of , and  (a batsman had to retire after\nreaching ), though the diary in which Sachin noted his scores has\nsince been lost. The coach was impressed enough to include him in\nSchoolboy Prodigy\n\nIS\n\n\fthe Kamat Memorial, one of the teams he managed. The year was\n.\nIt is said in Mumbai that if a boy wants to play cricket seriously, he\nshould study in Sharadashram English with its champion cricket\nteam. 'Boys joined the school for cricket. If they wanted to study they\ncould have gone somewhere else,' says Ranji Trophy player Amol\nMuzumdar who studied with Sachin in Sharadashram. (Outlook, \nJanuary ).\nSachin started school in the Indian Education Society's New\nEnglish School, close to the family home in Bandra (East) where\nmost of his friends also studied. But the school lacked a good cricket\nground and coach. Achrekar then approached Professor Rarnesh\nTendulkar with the suggestion that Sachin be moved to Sharadashrarn;\nhe was by now convinced the boy had potential. The father turned to\nAjit for his opinion. Till now Sachin had played cricket only during\nthe school vacations. Now he would have to combine studies and\ncricket.\nThe final decision was left to Sachin himself-a tough one for a\nboy so young. He would miss his school friends. Commuting every\nday from his home in Bandra (East) to the new school would take an\nhour each way, and he would have to change buses. However, it did\nnot take him very long to reach a decision. Cricket was more important\nthan fun and games in the backyard. Sharadashrarn it would be.\nFirst, though, carne the task of buying him a complete kit, under\nthe guidance of his coach. Ajit remembers that Sachin in his childlike excitement picked out the first bat he saw, one that appeared too\nbig and heavy for him. Both Ajit and Achrekar tried to dissuade him.\nBut he was firm in his choice and it has always been heavy bats from\nthen on. Today he wields one of the heaviest in the world, between \nand . pounds.\nBy now Sachin's life revolved around cricket and cricket alone.\nStudies had begun to take a backseat. Except for a four-month hiatus\nduring the monsoon months, when the only cricket played in Murnbai\nwas the Kanga League. Achrekar did not want to risk his star ward on\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe treacherous pitches where the ball would get up to all kinds of\ntricks, mostly of the dangerous variety. But those four months helped\nSachin forge what would become one of his closest friendships: with\nVinod Kambli. Before long, the two boys would find themselves in\nthe record books.\nSachin made his debut in  in the Giles under- tournament\nfor Sharadashram English (he was a reserve in the Harris under-)\nagainst Khoja Khan High School at the Navroze Cricket Club ground\non Azad Maidan; he was  and a half years old.\nHis first big match knock produced  runs. This included three\nstylish boundaries-a square cut, a cover drive and a straight drive.\nAjit was struck by the power in his kid brother's hands since most\ncricketers of that age do not have the strength to hit boundaries, getting\ntheir runs mainly in singles and two's. But Sachin's timing was so\ngood that he was able to find the gaps in the field, allowing the ball to\nrace to the boundary.\nThe first person to predict success for Sachin was an umpire by the\nname of Gondhalekar. He was umpiring the quarter-finals against\nDon Bosco at Cross Maidan in which Sachin smashed ten fours in a\nknock of . The umpire predicted toAchrekar that the lad would one\nday play for the country-a prediction Achrekar brushed aside since\nthis was Sachin's first year in competitive cricket. But Gondhalekar\ninsisted. Sadly, he would not be around to see his prediction come true\njust five years after it had been made.\nAchrekar was keen that Sachin get a place in the Bombay Cricket\nAssociation (BCA) nets for under- boys which were spread across\nthe city and were usually conducted by an ex-Test cricketer. These\nwere very popular during the summer vacations and there was a huge\nrush for the limited slots.\nAjit took Sachin to the MIG (Middle Income Group) Cricket Club\nground, a short walk from their home in Bandra, to meet the coach in\ncharge, a man named Dandekar. But Dandekarwas shocked when he\nheard Sachin was only , and bluntly told Ajit his kid brother was too\nyoung to get into the under- nets.\nSo the summer was spent in practice sessions with Achrekar, both\nSchoolboy Prodigy\n\n\n\n\fin the mornings and afternoons. Sessions intense enough for Sachin\nto say goodbye to a normal childhood with summer vacations filled\nwith childhood pranks and fun and games. At about this time, it was\ndecided that Sachin should move to his uncle and aunt's place near\nShivaji Park. The move was triggered by the events of one summer\nafternoon when Sachin and his friends were playing outside the house\nwhile the family watched the Hindi film Guide on television. They\nclambered up a mango tree to steal mangoes but came tumbling down\nwhen a branch broke under them. The next day his brother and father\nsent him for coaching and his career in cricket started.\nYears later, Sachin would list the names of his uncle and aunt, with\nthose of Ajit and his father, as his greatest influences.\nAll through this year of, it was cricket, cricket and more cricket.\nHe ate cricket, drank cricket, slept cricket. Even after he broke into\ninternational cricket, Sachin was known to talk--cricket, of course land walk in his sleep. And the phrase he uttered most often in his\nsleep? 'Don-ge' (Take two)!\nThe grind would begin at seven in the morning. Mter a quick\nbreakfast he would be at the ground at .. A batting session would be\nfollowed by tips from Achrekar, who was always on hand to guide his\nfavourite student. Bowling was a fascination with Sachin from the\nearly days and even then he bowled an assortment of medium pace\nand leg spin. Fielding was also taken seriously. The morning session\nwould last till ten and the afternoon one would begin at three and\ncontinue till seven. But there was no shortage of practice games either.\nIfhe got out early, Achrekar would take him across town on his scooter\nto the Azad Maidan where his Sassanian Cricket Club was playing,\nand Sachin would get to bat twice during the day. Thus were his\nsummer months spent, engrossed in the game.\nAt the age of, Sachin played his first match in the Kanga League,\nscoring five for the Young Parsee Cricket Club in the 'F' division.\nThis was during the monsoon. The season began in right earnest in\nOctober and this time Sachin played for another of Achrekar's clubs:\nHind Sevak Cricket Club in the Gordhandas Shield, open only to\nclubs in the suburbs ofMumbai. The team won the tournament with\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fSachin scoring  in his first game and  in the semi-finals, against\nexperienced bowlers with '!\\ division experience. A special batting\nprize was presented to the precocious youngster, still one year short of\nhis teens. By now he had made quite a name for himself and his\nschool fielded him in both the Giles and Harris Shield tournaments.\nIn fact, his maiden century came in the Harris, the senior of the two,\nin the - season.\nThe landmark came against Don Bosco School, Matunga, at the\nBharat Cricket Club ground at Shivaji Park. Sachin was unbeaten on\n at the end of the first day of the three-day match, coming in after\nthe loss of two wickets. To get over the tension, he decided to spend the\nnight at his parents' home instead of his uncle's. But it was a sleepless\nnight.\nEarly on the second day, one of the rival team's pace bowlers was\nsquare-cut to the boundary and Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar's first\ncentury entered the record books.\nSachin was then chosen for the Mumbai under- team for the\nVijay Merchant inter-zonal tournament to be played in Pune.Joining\nhim in the side was school chum Vinod Kambli. But he was run out\nfor one in a tournament marred by rain and did not make it to the West\nZone under- team.\nBy this time, the big names ofMumbai cricket were beginning to\ntake notice of the wonder boy. Former Ranji Trophy captain Milind\nRege, who was also a junior selector, assured Ajit that Sachin had the\npotential to go all the way. The - season had turned out to be a\nnotable one for Sachin. A maiden century and a recommendation\nfrom one ofMumbai cricket's old guards!\nHe played a full season ofKanga League cricket in - for the\n'F' division team of the John Bright Cricket Club. He scored  runs\nfor an average of nearly  when teams were struggling to reach \non the treacherous pitches. Scores of and  for the Shivaji Park\nGymkhana team against P.J.Hindu Gymkhana and the Dadar Union\nCricket Club in the G.RVisvanath Trophy for under- boys saw\nhim secure a berth in the Mumbai under- team for the Vijay\nMerchant Trophy.\nSchoolboy Prodigy\n\n\n\n\fIt has happened countless times since in newspapers and magazines\naround the world. But the very first time Sachin's photograph appeared\nin the papers was when he scored  against Maharashtra in just \nminutes, in the opening game at Baroda. That got him into the West\nZone under- team as he continued to scale the ladder of success at\nbewildering speed. West Zone lost to holders South Zone with Sachin's\n run-out being the highest score.\nNow it was back to do dmy for Sharadashram in the Harris Shield.\nIn the very first match he registered an amazing score for a boy barely\ninto his teens:  against BPM High School, that too in a single day\nagainst boys three or four years older than him. Just one rung lower,\nin the Giles Shield, Sachin had been appointed captain. The first\nmatch was against the powerful Balamohan, Ajit' s former team. Sachin\nconfidently predicted he would win not only the match, but the title\nas well.\nSharadashram were struggling at  for  in reply to Balamohan's\n when the captain came in and smashed  not out in two hours.\nThe team was on its way. And so was Sachin. Centuries came thick\nand fast as he switched back and forth between the under- and the\nunder- grade. Against St. Xavier's Fort in the Harris, he hit  for\nhis third consecutive inter-school ton. Then came  not out against\nthe same school in the Giles, and  against Barfiwala High School.\nIn the final of the Harris Shield, Sharadashram English faced their\nsister institution, Sharadashram Marathi. Sachin scored  and \nnot out in his side's victory and finished his Harris season with \nruns in five innings. Captaining his school in the Giles, Sachin\nsmashed  in the semi-finals, and then it was time for the final\nagainst Don Bosco, Matunga. His knocks of  and  were the top\nscores in a low-scoring game. And true to his word, he had led his\nschool to victory, scoring  runs with three centuries in the Giles\nShield. Sharadashram English achieved the Harris/Giles double that\nyear, largely due to Sachin's huge scores.\n\nMumbai's local newspapers have always devoted plenty of space on\ntheir sports pages to local cricket, from the Kanga League to school\ntournaments.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fThe distinction ofbeing the first journalist to interview the prodigy\nright after the 'double' fell to Sunil Warrier ofMid Day. Warrier, now\nwith the Times iflndi\u00a3, sent me a copy of that first interview (published\nin December ). He has vivid memories of the meeting, claiming\nwith a laugh: 'I made Sachin famous and then he made me famous.'\n'Sachin was making runs by the tons. I went to Shivaji Park in\nDadar and met him just around lunch. I told him that since he was\nfielding I would come later in the evening to chat with him,' Warrier\ntold me. 'I was quite surprised to see his brother too with him in the\nevening. I was wondering how he had found the time to call his brother\nto the ground. I suggested we go to a restaurant and have a cup of tea.\nThey agreed and we walked a short distance from the ground to a\nsmall Irani restaurant. It is one of the oldest in that area. As we started\nchatting I realized that Sachin was keeping mum and f\\jit was doing\nall the talking. Every time I asked a question, Sachin would prompt\nhis brother in Marathi, \"Tu sang na\" (You tell him). So I told him,\nsince you go to an English medium school you should speak to me in\nEnglish and not in Marathi. He smiled politely. We had tea and bun\nmaska and the session must have lasted about  minutes or so. I did\nmeet Sachin subsequently when he scored debut hundreds in the\nRanji Trophy and Irani Trophy. But I was weaned away from cricket\nto hockey and football and I never met Sachin again.'\nWarrier's interview mentioned that Sunil Gavaskar and Vivian\nRichards were Sachin's favourite batsmen, something he maintains\nto this day. 'The square cut and the off drive are his favourite strokes,'\nWarrier wrote. 'He loves to play one-day cricket more than a four-day\nmatch. His natural instincts are to attack from the word go.' The\ninterview revealed that 'he thrives on Michael Jackson songs' and\nconcluded with 'Sachin is also a good singer.'\nThere were so many tournaments to play and Sachin did not want\nto miss any of them-the Cosmopolitan Shield, the Bombay Junior\nCricket tournament, the Mahim-Dadar Shield and the Gordhandas\nShield, as well as a few matches for the BCA Colts. He scored his\nsecond double-century of the season,  in a day, against IES High\nSchoolboy Prodigy\n\n\n\n\fSchool in the Matunga Shield. (Incidentally, it would take him a\ndecade to score his maiden first-class double century and the same\nnumber of years to score his first Test double ton.)\nBut the fantastic season was destined to have a disappointing end.\nSachin had scored twice as many runs as any other school cricketer\nand was the only batsman to have scored a hundred for Mumbai in\nthe Vijay Merchant Trophy. He was the top scorer for the West Zone\nin the zonal competition for the same tournament. He had been prolific\nin club cricket against senior bowlers. Yet, he was bypassed for the\nBCA's Best Junior Cricketer of the Year award.lt was a strange decision.\nThere was consolation, however, in the form of a letter from Sunil\nGavaskar dated  August , which contained encouraging words\nand a postscript: 'Don't be disappointed at not getting the Best Junior\nCricketer award from BCA. If you look at the best award winners you\nwill find one name missing and that person has not done badly in Test\ncricket!!'\nEven while scoring a mountain of runs, Sachin did not neglect his\nbowling and picked up quite a few wickets with his medium-pacers.\nIn October of that year, he was part of the selection trials at the MRF\nPace Academy in Chennai (then known as Madras), overseen by\nAustralian fast bowling legend Dennis Lillee. But Lillee was not\nimpressed with his bowling and told him to concentrate on batting.\nSachin was not selected for the Academy.\nThe - season was a turning point in Sachin's fledgling career.\nEven while he was making his mark in every junior tournament\nin the city, both he and Ajit felt at the start of the season that there was\na chance to make it to first-class cricket. Sure enough, at the age of ,\nSachin became the youngest player ever selected for Mumbai in the\nWest Zone Ranji Trophy league.\nAfter useful scores in the Kanga League-where he had now\nleapfrogged to the 'B' division-he was selected for the Sportstar\nTrophy for boys under . The tournament, organized for schoolboys,\nfeatured teams named after famous Indian cricketers. Sachin's scores\nof ,  and  won him the Man of the Series award and rook his\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fteam (Dattu Phadkar XI) to victory.\nOn  November , the Mumbai Ranji Trophy selection panel\nof Ajit Wadekar, Sudhir Naik, Bapu Nadkarni and Sandeep Patil\nannounced the names of probables. Sachin's name was on the list.\nIt was just seven months after his fourteenth birthday.\nThe name ofSunil Gavaskar also figured on the list. But Gavaskar\nhad announced his retirement during the MCC Bicentenary match at\nLord's in August and thus the two narrowly missed playing in the\nsame team.\nSachin was in the reserves for the opening West Zone league tie\nagainst Baroda on  December. Though he got the chance to field as\na substitute in some of the games, he was not selected for the playing\neleven that season.\nRuns continued to flow in junior tournaments. But he failed to\ngain selection to the Indian team for the under- World Cup in\nAustralia. In the Giles and Harris Shield he had a fantastic run:  not\nout, ,  not out,  not out,  not out,  not out,  and .\nThe 'failures' ofO and , as well as  not out, were scored in the\nGiles Shield. His Harris Shield total of , runs came to the\nstaggering average of ,! The two triple centuries had come in the\nHarris Shield, in the semi-finals against St. Xavier's, Fort ( not\nout) and in the final against Anjuman-E-Islam ( not out).\n\nSchoolboy Prodigy\n\n\n World Record\n\nHe is a sure betfor India in afew years' time.- Raj Singh Dungarpur\n\nThe Harris Shield semi-final against St. Xavier's, Fort (Sunil\nGavaskar's old school) was played at the Sassanian Cricket Club\nground on Azad Maidan on - February , and it was this\nmatch that propelled Sachin into the world record books for the first\ntime.\nSt. Xavier's had in their ranks leg-spinner Sairaj Bahutule, a future\nTest cricketer, while defending champions Sharadashram had Vinod\nKambli and Amol Muzumdar besides Tendulkar in their team.\nMuzumdar would go on to captain Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy; he\nholds the world record for the highest score by a debutant in first-class\ncricket ().\nSachin won the toss and took first strike. Opening bowler Sanghani\npicked up the wickets of openers Atul Ranade () and R.Mulye ()\nand the score was  for  when Sachin joined Vi nod, who had by\nthen reached . At the end of the first day's play, Vinod was batting on\n and Sachin on .\nAchrekar was at the ground on the first day to watch his two pupils.\nBut he couldn't make it on the second and his deputy Laxman Chavan\nwas told to keep in touch with him over the phone. It was not long\nbefore both batsmen crossed  on the second morning and the total\nmounted to . Chavan spoke to Achrekar who told him to pass on\ninstructions to Sachin to declare and give enough time for his bowlers\nto dismiss St. Xavier's on the second day itself.\n\\chrekar Sir's assistant ran all round trying to attract our attention\n\n\fso that he could tell us to declare. Sachin kept telling me not to look at\nhim. We even started singing,' recalled Kambli years later in the\ntelevision documentary Tendulkarat .\nFinally, a stern warning over the phone during the lunch break\nforced Sachin to declare at   for . He was on  (one six,  fours)\nand Kambli on  (three sixes,  fours). The runs had come from\njust  overs: more than a run a ball. The sole maiden was bowled by\nSanghani who had the 'best' figures of for . Bahutule conceded\n runs from his  overs. By close, a thoroughly demoralized St.\nXavier's were  for .\n'Yes, I was angry with Sachin and Vinod as they batted on and on,'\nAchrekar recalls with a chuckle. 'After all, you cannot bat forever.'\nPerhaps for the first time, Sachin got a ticking offfrom his coach. He\ndid not play in the match the next day as he shifted grounds to play in\na Giles Shield game. St. Xavier's crumbled to  with Kambli picking\nup  for   with his offbreaks.\nA month later, it was revealed in the media that the unbeaten stand\nfor the third wicket worth  runs was a world record for any wicket\nin any class of cricket. The previous record stood in the names ofT.\nPal ton and N. Rippon for Buffalo River v Whoroughly at Gapstead in\nVictoria, Australia in -.\nThanks to that band of dedicated number crunchers, the\nAssociation of Cricket Statisticians and Scorers oflndia, this feat was\nrecognized as a world record, and the boys got plenty of coverage.\nThey were thrilled to see their names in both the Guinness Book if\nVHJrtd Records and Wtsden Cricketers' Almanack.\nWhile Sachin was not a new name for Mumbai cricket followers,\nhe was for most of us in the rest of the country. I was then with the\nIndian Express in Chennai. My brother sent me a cutting from Delhi,\nof an article on the world record by the late Sunder Rajan that had\nappeared in the Times ifIndia, Mumbai. He wrote across the cutting:\nWatch out for this boy.'\n'The world record helped us a lot,' recalled Kambli in an interview\nto the Sportstar ( September ). 'That enabled us to jump the\nladder. Previously you had to come through the rungs; we were lucky.'\nWorld Record\n\n\n\n\fThe Harris Shield final is the most important fixture in Mumbai\nschool cricket. Befitting the occasion, the match is played at Brabourne\nStadium, still a favourite with the city's cricket cognoscenti despite\nthe presence of the Wankhede Stadium just across the street.\nSharadashram English were up against the formidable Anjuman-EIslam who had an equally glorious record in the competition. Sachin\nwon the toss and decided to bat. But there wasn't going to be a repeat of\nthe world-beating semi-final. Kambli was out for  with the score on\n for . By close, Sachin was batting on . He had begun slowly,\nbut gradually played his favourite lofted shots to spread the field. He\nadded a further  runs the next day and was on  in a total of \nfor . The local press had by now latched on to the fact that there was\na real talent in their midst and most papers carried Sachin's photograph\nthe next morning. Sharadashram added  runs before being all out\non the third morning, Sachin's share being  to stay unbeaten on\n-his second consecutive unbeaten triple century in the\ntournament. There was just one life-he was dropped in the covers\nwhenon.\nAnjuman finished the third and penultimate day on  for .\nStraight after the rigours ofhis triple ton, Sachin came on to bowl\novers of medium pace on the trot. The match ended with Anjuman\non  for  with Sachin having claimed four wickets in  overs (\nmaidens). Since even the first innings could not be completed, it was\ndecided that the teams would be declared joint winners.\nTendulkar paid tribute to the Harris Shield and its role in his early\ndevelopment, on the hundredth anniversary of the tournament. In\nthe Lord Harris Shield Cricket Tournament: Commemoration Tf:Jlume,  he wrote:\nOne cannot but be amazed at the vision and dedication of those\nwho had thought of organizing the tournament for\nschools .... The Harris Shield has a special significance for me.\nAs everyone knows, the unbeaten partnership of between\nVi nod Kambli and myselfbrought both of us into the limelight.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fThus, often I wonder what I would have been had there been\nno Harris Shield tournament. As it has been in my case, the\nHarris Shield has shaped the destiny ofcountless cricketers in\nMumbai.\nThe tournament has made Mumbai cricket a great force to\nreckon with. Its contribution to the game is invaluabl~. And it\nhas withstood the test of time. There are not many tournaments\nin the world that can claim to have completed one hundred\nyears.\nI particularly cherish the fact that I had the good fortune of\nleading my school, Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English), to\nvictory in the Harris Shield.\nThe tournament enabled me to show my cricketing skills at\nan early age. With the game becoming increasingly popular\nand with youngsters taking to it in large numbers the Harris\nShield assumes added significance as the launching pad for\nfresh talent.\nSachin was still in school when Raj Singh Dungarpur, one of the\ndoyens of Mumbai cricket and the president of the Cricket Club of\nIndia (cCI), took the initiative to make Sachin a member of the\nprestigious club, whose home is the Brabourne Stadium. The club\nchanged its rules to allow Sachin to play for them in the Kanga League.\nClub rules stipulated that no one below  years was allowed in the\npavilion or the dressing rooms. Sachin was just !\nIn an article on Tendulkar by Scyld Berry (Wtsden Cricket Monthly,\nJune ), Raj Singh-then chairman of the national selection\ncommittee-looked back eight years on Sachin's innings in the Harris\nShield final of April .\n'What I recall was his tremendous maturity. He was playing on a\nfull-sized ground for the first time. The field was spread out and he\nkept driving singles to long off and long on. Then he checked his shot\nand started taking twos. That was maturity and a high level of\nconfidence.' Raj Singh was also quoted in a more contemporary profile\nWorld Record\n\n\n\n\fofSachin by Shirish Nadkarni soon after his school and early Ranji\ntrophy feats, in the Cricketer International (April).\nThis boy is simply amazing; I have never seen so much\nconcentration and stamina in one so young. He is very strong\non the leg side, but otherwise plays strictly in the 'V' to either\nside of the bowler and all along the ground. His concentration\nis really astounding-in the two days-plus that he batted while\nscoring  against Anjuman, there was just one blemish and\nperhaps one uppish square-cut that nearly went to hand.\nFurther, you must remember that he came to the wicket when\nhis team was in a tight corner, having lost early wickets. He\nplayed with great responsibility and never lofted the ball. And\nthen he came on to bowl all those tidy overs of medium pace\nand spin! There is so much of Greg Chappell that I see in\nhim-the batting, the strokes, the bowling style. If carefully\nnurtured, he is a sure bet for India in a few years' time.\nThe prediction would come true seven months-not seven\nyears-after the article was published. For Sachin would make his\ninternational debut in November .\n\n\n\nSachin\n",
    "1989-1993": " A Boy Among Men\n\nTendulkar neverfoils.-Naren Tamhane\nRaj Singh Dungarpur, with his eye for talent, played a major role in\nthe formative stages of Sachin's cricketing career. The former\nRajasthan medium-pacer (and erstwhile royalty) arranged for a\nsponsor (the Birla Trust) to enable Sachin to go on his first tour abroad,\nto England with the Star Cricket Club. The manager of Star was\nanother former RaJasthan medium-pacer, Kailash Gattani, who also\nhad playing experience in England with the Kent second eleven. The\ntour began in June , when the hot summer months in Mumbai\nensured that there was no competitive cricket to speak of.\nIt was a tight schedule, with  matches (all of  overs) played in\na span ofjust  days. Two days of sightseeing were allotted for the\nboys, all under , during which they visited Edinburgh Castle and\nthe museum at Lord's. Future Test cricketers Vi nod Kambli and Sameer\nDighe were also in the squad. In the first match against Indian\nGymkhana, Sachin scored . He followed it up with scores of, \nnot out, ,  not out and , all scored at a rapid rate.\nWhat is more, he played throughout with an injury: a wart on the\nleft hand between the thumb and the index finger which caused\nconsiderable pain and prevented him from gripping the bat properly.\nSachin was back in the UK the following year with Star, and this\ntime he scored his first century on foreign soil. It was in the opening\nmatch against Haywards Heath Cricket Club and came from just \nballs, with  fours and two sixes. The team had a few first-class\ncricketers from Sussex in the side, as well as future South Mrican Test\n\n\fpace bowler Meyrick Pringle. There was nearly another century for\nSachin, against Horsham Cricket Club, and this time his  came off\n deliveries.\nThe two trips gave Sachin valuable exposure to the variable pitches\nand the changing weather patterns in England. The experience would\nhold him in good stead, for just  months after the second tour hewould be back again-this time as a member of the Indian national\nteam.\nMter returning to Mumbai with the Star team in , it was time\nfor Sachin to play for the CCI in the first division of the Kanga League.\nHe was among the top scorers with  runs in six innings. The\nsecretary of the CCI cricket committee and former Mumbai Ranji\nTrophy captain Milind Rege was suitably impressed by the way Sachin\nplayed-like a 'grown-up man'-getting on top of the ball even on a\ndrying track. The seniors in the team paled by comparison.\nThere was just one more taste ofjunior cricket before Sachin made\nhis first-class debut. This was as captain of the Mumbai under- side\nin the Vijay Hazare tournament, in which he scored  in the final of\nthe West Zone league, against Maharashtra.\nA week later, his world would change forever.\nThere was little doubt now that Sachin would make his Ranji Trophy\ndebut in the season's opening West Zone league game at the Wankhede\nStadium against Gujarat. But before that, he had to play in the trial\nmatches. The selection committee ofNaren Tamhane, Milind Rege,\nSudhir Naik and Ajit Wadekar were suitably impressed, for Sachin\nscored  in the first game and  in the second, with nine boundaries.\nThe innings came against an attack that included Test opening bowler\nRaJu Kulkarni, reckoned at the time to be one of the fastest in the\ncountry, and that too on a green top.\nYears later, Sachin would recall how he irritated Kulkarni by batting\nwithout a helmet. It was not meant as a provocation-he simply did\nnot possess one!\nRege- wrote in Sportsweek, We decided to induct Sachin in the\nBombay Ranji XI at his usual number four position. Every member\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fin the team was delighted with the way Sachin batted. In fact, he was\nthe only one to drive off the front foot while facing Kasliwal, Kher and\nSabnis who worked up a decent pace on the Wankhede practice wickets\nwhich are fairly nippy. The reason why I say this is because everybody\nthese days tends to go on the back foot for a medium-pacer.'\nDilip Vengsarkar was captain of both the Mumbai Ranji Trophy\nteam and the national team at the time. He had never seen Sachin bat\nand needed to be convinced that this boy, who was just  and barely\nfive feet two inches tall, could stand up to adults. The Indian team was\nin Mumbai for a Test match against New Zealand, and Vengsarkar\ninvited the schoolboy to the nets where he got a chance to face the\nmighty Kapil Dev. Kapil initially bowled off a shorter run-up. But\nseeing Sachin play him confidently, he stepped up the pace and even\nslipped in a few bouncers. Sachin was unfazed and stood up to him\nwithout flinching.\nAsked for his verdict, Kapil was cautious. 'Don't write too much\nabout him now,' he told the newsmen. 'There is some way to go.'\nVengsarkar, though, was impressed enough to give the go-ahead for\nthe teenager's inclusion in Mumbai's Ranji fixture against Gujarat.\nThe experience of facing Kapil left a lasting impression on Sachin.\n'I couldn't sleep that night because I had played  balls from Kapil\nDev. I remember each of those balls like it was yesterday,' he was to say\nten years later (Outlook,  August ).\nSachin's debut match was played on - December  and\nwas the opening match in the Talim Shield, symbol of supremacy in\nthe Ranji \u00b7ophy West Zone division. With Vengsarkar on national\nduty, Mumbai were led by Lalchand Raj put who had earlier opened\nin Tests for the country. Gujarat's captain was Dhansukh Patel.\nNormally, a match involving Gujarat, one of the traditional\nwhipping boys in the W('st Zone, would evince little interest. But this\ntime Mumbai's cricketing elite turned up in force to watch the prodigy\nmake his debut. The entire selection committee was present as were\nGavaskar, Achrekar and Raj Singh-who was at the time the chairman\nof the national selection committee. The small crowd of about \nincluded many boys from Sahitya Sahawas as well as from\nA Boy Among Men\n\nJl\n\n\fSharadashram, all come to cheer their friend.\nThe match began dramatically after Gujarat won the toss, with\nS.D. Pathak bowled by Kasliwal from the first ball of the match. Gujarat\ndid not recover from that early shock and were skittled out for \nbefore the tea break. By close, Mumbai were  for the loss ofShishir\nHattangadi's () wicket. The fans would have to wait one more day\nto watch their favourite in action.\nGujarat's total was passed quickly enough on the second day. Alan\nSippy and his captain added  runs for the second wicket and the\npair batted serenely almost till the lunch break. But the spectators had\ncome for one thing only-to watch Sachin bat. With the interval\nbarely  minutes away, Rajput going for a third run was run out for\n at  for , and Sachin made his way to the crease, heralded by\nrapturous applause. His moment had arrived.\nSeven deliveries later, Sachin faced his first ball in first-class cricket,\nbowled by off-spinner N isarg Patel. The batsman defended. The same\nwith the second. The third, tossed up outside the off stump, was\npromptly driven inside out through the covers for four. Sachin's first\nscoring stroke in first-class cricket was a boundary. A sign of things to\ncome for bowlers around the world! The next two balls were defended\nand the last of the over produced another boundary, driven past the\nbowler and mid-on. At lunch Sachin was on ten. Between lunch and\ntea his score progressed to the s with a full range of attacking strokes\nas Mumbai strove for quick runs and bonus batting points. Together,\nSachin and Sippy added  runs to the score, then the left-bander\ndeparted for , bowled by left-arm spinner Joy Zinto, and Mumbai\nwere  for .\nA mini collapse ensued. Iqbal Khan was bowled for a duck and\nSuru Nayak was run out for two. Sachin was joined by another\ndebutant, Sameer Talpade, by which time he had progressed to .\nLeft-arm spinner Bharat Mistry came on to bowl to a slip, point, cover,\ndeep extra cover, mid-off, long off, mid-on, midwicket and square leg.\nMistry tossed the ball up, inviting the drive. Sachin obliged, the shot\nleaving the fielders rooted as he raced to . The tension in the stands\nwas now at breaking point. The next ball was faster and flatter. Sachin\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fwent on the front foot and with a neat turn of the wrists to backward\nsquare leg, he got the vital run. The century on debut was complete\nand the stadium erupted in applause. The  had come offjust \nballs, with  fours. In the next over, Talpade was out for five and\nMumbai declared at  for . The crowd rose as Sachin returned to\nthe pavilion, unbeaten on .\nAt  years,  months and  days, Sachin Tendulkar entered the\nrecord books as the youngest Indian to score a century on first-class\ndebut. The match was drawn as Gujarat scored  in their second\ninnings and Mumbai finished on  for , with Sachin not batting a\nsecond time. But for once, the result was irrelevant.\nThere were five days between this opening match and the next\nagainst Saurashtra at Rajkot-enough time for more Harris Shield\ncricket. Against Bandra Urdu High School, Sachin's  runs were\nscored in a mere two hours. That same night he left with the team for\nRajkot, where a shock awaited Mumbai. Raj put and Sippy were both\nout for a duck in the very first over bowled by left-arm medium-pacer\nRajesh Jadeja. Unlike in his debut match, this time there was the\npressure of a scoreboard reading  for  when Sachin came to the\ncrease to join opener Hattangadi. He put his head down as the situation\ndemanded, and batted for  minutes and  balls before getting\nout for . The stand was worth  and Hattangadi went on to score\n in a small Mumbai total of. None of the other batsmen could\ncross . Saurashtra gained the rare honour of taking the first innings\nlead as they scored .\nIn the second innings Sachin came in at number three with the\nscore reading  and this time played  deliveries for his innings\ntop score of with seven boundaries, the same as in the first innings.\nHe narrowly missed his second century in three innings when he\nplayed an overambitious shot, slashing at spinner Virbhadran Gohil\nto be well caught by Bimal Jadeja at point. A newspaper report the next\nday commented that 'Tendulkar showed uncanny judgement in\nmeting out the right treatment to every ball.... He danced to hit the\nball to the straight field and imparted quite a bit of power to his cover\ndrives and square cuts. He has one flaw. He gets carried away and\nA Boy Among Men\n\n\n\n\fcannot be curbed even by the non-striker or by advice shouted from\nthe gallery.'\nThis match too was drawn, with Mumbai declaring their second\ninnings at  for  and Saurashtra scoring  for .\nFollowing his first two matches, a remarkable article on Sachin by\nMumbai journalist Shirish Nadkarni appeared in the Cricketer\nInternational (April ). The headline was startling: ~ Good As\nGavaskar?' Mter recountingSachin's scores in the first three innings\nof his fledgling first-class career, Nadkarni wrote: 'If this is the rate at\nwhich Sachin Tendulkar is going to be setting cricketing records, he\nmay even end up putting the great Sunil Gavaskar in the\nshade .... [Sachin] is already being talked about as being better than\nGavaskar was at the same age. Mter all, Gavaskar was not called up for\nRanji duty until he was out of his teens, whereas Sachin will only\ncelebrate his sixteenth birthday on  April. Until this point the\ncomparison runs very much in his favour, but otherwise it is invidious,\nsince Sachin is basically an attacking batsman whereas Sunny was a\nmaster of classical defensive technique.'\nEven after making a mark at the first-class level, Sachin continued\nto play for his school and age-specific tournaments, treating all matches\nwith equal importance. By now, Sanjay Manjrekar, Dilip Vengsarkar\nand Chandrakant Pandit were back from the Test series against New\nZealand and turned out for Mumbai in their third league match\nagainst Baroda in Thane. But there was no dislodging Sachin from\nthe team. Baroda were led by Anshuman Gadcwad with wicketkeeper\nKiran More and left-arm medium-pacer Rashid Patel (all with Test\nexperience) also in the side. This would be Sachin's most formidable\nopposition to date.\nBaroda batted first and scored . Mumbai lost openers Rajput\nand Hattangadi with only  on the board, and Sachin came in ahead\nofVengsarkar who was nursing an injured right knee. Patel and Abhay\nPalkar were both working up a good pace. Sachin quickly hit them\nboth for boundaries. But a- lifter from Patel had him caught behind by\nMore for , his first failure in first-class cricket. Mumhai gained a\nlead of  runs and the match was drawn, with Sachin not batting in\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fa second innings total of  for .\nThe Indian under- team was to tour Pakistan for the first time and\nSachin was a certainty. He scored  in the trial match and also had a\ndouble century and a century in the under- Coach Behar Trophy.\nBut the tour was for six weeks' duration and his Secondary School\nCertificate (sse) finals were not far off His family decided that his\nfinal year of school had to take precedence. However, he continued\ntouring with the Mumbai Ranji Trophy side since he would be away\nfrom home for only a few days. His school books were packed with his\ncricket gear. 'The school teachers were willing to help me whenever I\nwent to them for guidance,' said Tendulkar in an interview to the\nSportstaf ( May ), looking back on those early years. 'I used to\nattend those special classes. It was just that I had to miss classes in my\nlast year in school. It was hard to cope with studies. My father had a\ngreater role to play in my success. He told me, \"Whatever you want to\nbe, see that you achieve something. Do something where the future is\nfully secured. I don't want you to try out in every field. If you want to\nplay tennis, establish yourself as a good tennis player. Or prove to be a\ngood cricketer. I don't want to compel you to pursue something.\"'\nObviously, the late Professor Tendulkar was a man of vision. Sachin\ndid pass his exams but from then on, all further tests would be on the\ncricket field.\nThe last West Zone league match was at Aurangabad in January\n against Maharashtra. With Ravi Shastri back in the team after\nTest duty, Mumbai now had eight former, current or future Test players\nin its ranks. The home side fielded two promising pace bowlers, Salil\nAnkola and Gregory D'Monte. Ankola had taken a hat-trick in his\ndebut match against Gujaratearlier in the season, while D'Monte had\ntoured Zimbabwe with the India under- team.\nMaharashtra ran up a huge  in their first innings with opener\nSurendra Bhave scoring nearly half the total off his own bat. Rajput\nand Pandit gave Mumbai a flying start with an opening stand worth\n and with Manjrekar also chipping in, they were well placed at \nfor . They finished on . Tendulkar scored  and four not out in\nA Boy Among M-en\n\n\n\n\fthe drawn match and Maharashtra finished on top of the West Zone\nleague with  points. Mumbai were second, on , to join them in\nthe knockout stage. Remarkably, for a -year-old in a team full of\ninternational stars, Sachin topped the Mumbai batting in the league\nphase with  runs at an average of.. One fascinated viewer of\nSachin's  was Sandeep Bamzai who wrote about it in his book\nGavaskar and Tendulkar: Shaping Indian Cricket's Destiny:\nAnkola tried to intimidate the little fella (Sachin), but he took a\nheavy toll of the wayward bowling. Benign surface or not, it\nwas a stylish knock which still reverberates in the corridors' of\nmy mind for the sheer elan and timing displayed. As Ankola\nbowled on his legs, Tendulkar smashed him to the mid-wicket\nfence twice, in a trice. The following over, he gave him the\nsame treatment, but this time round, on the off side. He raced\nto  and there was a shot where he bisected the cover fielders,\nrocking on his backfoot which took our collective breath away\nin the sharniana which served as the press box.\nThe match was played shortly before the team for the tour to the\nWest Indies was selected and Ankola was on the short-list, though he\ndid not make it. He would eventually play for the country. Mumbai\ntook on Hyderabad next, led by future India skipper Mohammad\nAzharuddin, in the pre-quarter-finals at Secunderabad in February,\nand by coincidence I was in Hydcrabad to report on the national table\ntennis championships for the Indian Express. With Sachin's reputation\nhaving preceded him, every sports journalist in town made a beeline\nfor the dust bowl that was the Gymkhana Ground at Secunderabad,\nthe twin city ofHyderabad.\nThe large open ground was dotted with shamianas and had no\nseating to speak of. But Sachin had already become a major crowdpuller and there must have been close to , spectators-an\nunusually large crowd for a Ranji Trophy match, even one with so\nmany Test players in both sides. The pitch was a typical turner and the\nspinners played a leading role from the very first session of the first\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fday Hyderabad had three spinners of note: Venkatapathy Raju (leftarm), Arshad Ayub (off spin) and M.V. Narasimha Rao (leg spin)\nwhile Mumbai could call on the services ofRavi Shastri (left-arm),\nSuru N ayak (leg spin) and Kir an Mokashi (off spin).\nSure enough, wickets tumbled to spin as Hyderabad were dismissed\nfor  (Shastri -, Mokashi -). Mumbai too were struggling at\n for  by the close of the second day. Mokashi was sent in as\nnightwatchman after Ayub and Raju had accounted for Raj put, Pandit\nand Manjrekar. But he too fell to Ayub, and Sachin came in at  for \nat the fag end of the day in the company of captain Vengsarkar.\nSachin defended the first ball he faced and drove the next to the\nboundary. That evening he cornered the team's manager, P.K. 'Joe'\nKamath with whom he was sharing a hotel room. Kamath reported\nthe conversation in the Wisden Cricket Monthly Guly ): 'Sir, why\ndid you send a bowler ahead of me? Did you not have confidence in\nme?' asked Sachin. Kamath confessed that he did not have an answer.\nThe tiny baby-faced Sachin and Vengsarkar, the towering captain\nof the national team, were a study in contrast, at least physically. But\nSachin matched his skipper stroke for stroke as they added  runs to\ntake Mumbai out of the woods and eventually to a narrow first innings\nlead. Sachin's  came in  minutes and contained  fours. In the\nsecond innings, he took  runs. Mumbai won the match by six\nwickets. I recall everyone in the press box, both experienced hands and\nrookie reporters, being struck by the maturity of the callow youth and\nthe confidence ofhis stroke play Many in the fraternity were predicting\ngreat things from the schoolboy.\nRavi Shastri was the third Mumbai captain in the season for the\nquarter-final against Uttar Pradesh which was played at home, as\nVengsarkar was unavailable. Mter an opening stand worth  between\nR~putand Hattangadi (), the Mumbai battir::gcollapsed, the next\nnine batsmen failing to reach even double figures. Sachin was\ndismissed for just seven by Test off-spinner Gopal Sharma who had\nthe. best figures of  for . But Uttar Pradesh suffered an even more\ndramatic collapse, crumbling from  for  to  all out. Mumbai\npiled up  in their second innings (Sharma -). There was\nA Boy Among Men\n\n\n\n\fanother half-century by Sachin, his  taking four minutes short of\nfour hours, his longest stint at the crease so far. Mumbai won by \nruns and ran into the formidable Delhi in the semi-finals at the\nWankhede Stadium.\nMumbai were weakened by the absence ofVengsarkar, Shastri and\nManjrekar, back on national duty in the West Indies. The Delhi side,\non the other hand, had a formidable look to it with Madan Lal,\nManinder Singh, Manoj Prabhakar and Raman Lamba. Delhi piled\nup  in their first innings. Manu Nayyar () and Prabhakar ()\nput on  for the opening wicket. Tendulkar got his first chance to\nbowl in first-class cricket (---; ---) and also took his first\ncatch (Manoj Prabhakar for  off Nayak's bowling in the second\ninnings). Left-arm spinner Maninder Singh, who had not been\nconsidered for the West Indies tour, had the splendid figures of-~\n- when Mumbai batted. Hattangadi () was once again among\nthe runs and was third out at . But it was Sachin who took the\nhonours and top-scored with . It was his seventh score of  plus in\nthe season, in  innings, and contained a six and five fours. He began\naggressively, hitting boundaries off Maninder and Madan Lal,\nscattering the field. But the rest of the Mumbai batting could not\ncounter Maninder's spin and at the end of the third day, they were\nstruggling at  for  with Sa chin on . His first six came early on\nthe third day, a huge shot that travelled nearly  yards from a drive off\nSanjay Sharma, an off-spinner. Sachin was lastman out and Mumbai\nwere dismissed for . The match was drawn, but Delhi were in the\nfinal thanks to their first-innings lead of runs.\nManinder, one of the most talented spinners to play for the country,\nhas fond memories of that match. His seven wickets proved to be a\nmatch-winning performance. But it was Sachin's  that caught his\neye.\n'The first ball I bowled to him he smashed over extra cover, one\nbounce four. I was so impressed that for the first time in my entire life\nI said, \"God, I hope he scores runs. I would love to watch him,\"'\nManinder told me when I interviewed him in August .\n'He was so good, so compact at the age of  and a half, it was\n]\n\nSachin\n\n\ftremendous. When I came back to Delhi after that match, I told my\ncoach that I had just seen a future star in action.'\nDespite his outstanding maiden first-class season ( runs from\n innings at ., with one century and six s) it had been deCided\nthat Sachin was too raw to be chosen for the Indian team on their tour\nofthe mighty West Indies. The chairman of the selection board, Raj\nSingh, admitted the selectors 'seriously thought' about choosing him.\n'But we decided to wait till until the tour of Pakistan [later in ] .'\nIt was perhaps a wise decision not to expose him to the West Indian\nquicks at such a tender age. Not that Sachin himself thought so.\nJust before the team to the West Indies was announced, actorjournalist Tom Alter interviewed Sachin for a sports video (Sports\nChannel).\nAlter: Are you willing to go to the West Indies?\nSachin: Ifl get selected I will go.\nAlter: How will you face Ambrose, Walsh and the others?\nSachin: I will try my best to face them.\nAlter looked back at that interview in Outlook magazine Ganuary\n):\nFour points stood out. Firstly he stated that Gavaskar and\nRichards were his heroes. Secondly, without hesitation he said\nthat he could read Hirwani's googly, and was ready to face the\nWest Indian fast bowlers (in fact, he said he prefers fast bowling).\nThirdly, when asked whether he grew tired of batting while\nwith Kambli in that mammoth partnership, Sachin's reply was\nan almost unbelievable shake of the head. And fourthly, Sachin\nmade it very clear that being compared to Gavaskar was a bit\nembarrassing to him, and that he simply wanted to play his\nown, 'natural' game.\nThe - season kicked off in Mumbai with the Irani Trophy\nmatch between Ranji Trophy champions Delhi and the Rest oflndia\nA Boy Among Men\n\n\n\n\ffor whom Sachin was an automatic choice. It was played on -\nNovember  and was a virtual selection trial for the tour to Pakistan\nstarting later that month. The selection committee consisting of Raj\nSingh Dungarpur (chairman), G.R.Visvanath, Naren Tamhane,\nRamesh Saxena and Akash Lal were to select the team on the third\nevening of the match, so competition was hound to be intense.\nDelhi piled up  and by close on the second day, Rest were  for\n with Rajput, Surendra Bhave and Manjrekar the batsmen back in\nthe pavilion. It would be uphill all the way after that. When Gursharan\nSingh was out for  on the third morning, Sachin joined\nnightwatchman Syed Saba Karim with the total on  for . Sachin\npunished the medium pace ofSanjeev Sharma and Atul Wassan, but\nwas troubled by Maninder's accurate left-arm spin. Wassan had picked\nup two of the four wickets that had fallen at that stage and was bowling\nwith his tail up. After playing himself in, Sachin on-drove and then\nstraight drove Wassan to the boundary. Captain Madan Lal replaced\nWassan with Sharma who was promptly smashed for four, followed\nby a square cut off Maninder that went racing to the boundary for\nSachin's fourth four. But Maninder was persisted with and made the\nbreakthrough under rather fortuitous circumstances. As Sachin\ndefended on the front foot, the ball went off the middle of the bat,\ndropped to the ground and spun on to the stumps to bowl him for a\ncrisply struck . Rest were dismissed for  to give Delhi a big lead.\nThat evening, all talk centred on the selection of the team to Pakistan.\nIt was an agonizing wait for the Tendulkar family, but finally they got\nconfirmation ofSachin's selection following a phone call late in the\nevening from a reporter asking for reactions. The match itself must\nhave seemed anticlimactic after that. There was no stopping Delhi,\nhowever, who declared on the fifth morning at their overnight total of\n for . The target of for Rest on the last day was an impossibility.\nBut it did give Sachin another crack at the record books.\nIncidentally, during the meeting to select the team for Pakistan,\nthe view was expressed that Sachin might be a failure. 'Tendulkar\nnever fails,' was the reply by the late N aren Tamhane, the West Zone\nrepresentative.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fSachin went in with the score at  for  and as if to celebrate the\nnews ofhis selection, went for the Delhi bowlers. Wassan and Sharma\nwere pretty liberal with the short-pitched stuff, but it didn't seem to\nbother Sachin. By now, it was virtually Sachin v Delhi as wickeb\ntumbled at the other end. Maninder, who had taken four wickets in\nthe first innings including that ofSachin, was hit over mid-wicket for\na huge six. 'It was a brilliant innings. He was hungry for runs and\nmore runs even at that age,' Maninder told me. 'That is what makes\nhim get out of tricky situations. From  years onwards, it was his\nhunger for perfection that was his greatest quality.'\nSachin raced to  from just  balls, with seven fours, and was\nrapidly running out of partners. Maninder once again bowled well to\nclaim three wickets. At  for , the tail was exposed. Sachin tried to\nretain the strike as much as possible. Razdan and he added  runs,\nVivek Razdan's cootrfumion being just two. But at  for ,\nVenkatapathy Raju came otlt in the form of the last man as Gursharan\nSingh had fractured a finger on his right hand while batting. Raju was\nout at  with Sachin atill  runs short of the magic three-figure\nmark. By this time Raj Singh had told Gursharan to pad up and stay\nwith Sachin till he got his c-entury. He batted with only his left-hand\nglove on as he could not slip the other glove on. Batting courageously\nwith one hand, Gursharan faced  deliveries, finally retiring hurt on\nfive when Sachin cover drove Maninder for his fourteenth boundary\nto go from  to . The Rest innings was terminated at  and\nSachin had registered his second century in eight first-class matches.\nIt was during this match that Gavaskar presented his ultralight\nmoulded Morant fibreglass batting pads to the young batsman who\nwould take over his mantle as the bedrock of the Indian batting in the\nyears to come. At  years and  days, Sachin had added another\n'youngest' record to his collection-the youngest to score a century in\nthe Irani Trophy, that too on debut.\nNow for the cauldron of Pakistan.\n~\n\nA Boy Among Men\n\n\n The lad is agenius.-Abdul Qadir\nThe selection of the team to Pakistan for what turned out to be the last\nTest tour by an Indian team (till mid-), generated more than the\nusual share of controversy. The team would be captained in Tests for\nthe first time by Tamil Nadu opening batsman Krishnamachari\nSrikkanth. His elevation had come under remarkable circumstances,\neven for Indian cricket, where unusual happenings are commonplace.\nIndia had been beaten - in five Tests in the Caribbean and swept\naway - in the one-day series. Mter the West Indies debacle, the\nIndian captain Dilip Vengsarkar had given a taped interview to Mudar\nPatherya of Sportsworld (May ) in which he blamed everyone but\nhimself, despite his woeful batting form. To make things worse, he\nhad gone on to the United States, with several other cricketers, to play\nexhibition matches which had been specifically forbidden by the BCCI.\nThe players were banned on their return to India, and though the\nSupreme Court subsequently lifted the ban, Vengsarkar's brief reign\nas captain was over.\nSrikkanth can consider himself lucky that midway through the\nWest Indies tour he had his arm fractured by a short ball from Ian\nBishop, or he would certainly have joined the team to the us. As it\nhappened, he was the compromise candidate of the Board. The shock\nomission was that of Mohinder Amarnath. Vengsarkar had ruled\nhimself out of the tour, perhaps anticipating he would be dropped in\nany case.\nThe team was widely described a:; the weakest bowling\n\n\fcombination ever sent to Pakistan. In the event, the fact that the fourTest series was drawn - is a tribute to the captain and the players\nunder his command. But perhaps the biggest factor in India escaping\nunbeaten was the appointment of two neutral umpires, John Holder\nand John Hampshire from England.\nThis was the idea of Pakistan captain lmran Khan who wanted to\nput to rest, once and for all, the complaints against Pakistani umpires\nby visiting teams. The neutral umpires experiment had been tried out\nin an earlier series in Pakistan when the West Indies were the visitors,\nwith two Indian umpires standing in for the first time. This time\nround, though neither Holder nor Hampshire was faultless, their\nsupervision reduced the level of tension caused by the umpiring\nwhenever and wherever the two countries had met in the past.\nSrikkanth's leadership impressed one and all, but he failed with\nthe bat. And this would prove to be his first and last assignment as\ncaptain. Mohammad Azharuddin replaced him for the tour to New\nZealand in .\nOne thing which may have told against Srikkanth was his backing\nof his players in their protest against the BCCI on the eve of their\ndeparture to Pakistan. The Board and the team could not agree on\nfinancial terms, and as a protest the entire team decided to forfeit their\nearnings from the series. Only the three newcomers, Sachin, Vivek\nRazdan and Salil Ankola were exempted from this action by the players\nand allowed to pocket their fees. Srikkanth, perhaps, was made to pay\nthe price for supporting his teammates. Certainly, the pay dispute was\nan unfortunate prologue to Sachin's bow in international cricket. His\nselection, however, was widely welcomed.\nThe tour began on  November at Lahore with a one-day charity\ngame in aid oflmran Khan's cancer hospital. The next day was the\n'\nonly first-class\nfixture before the start of the first Test: a three-day\ngame against the Cricket Board Patron's XI at Rawalpindi where\nSachin made his first appearance in national colours. The match was\ndrawn, with the tourists scoring  in their only innings. Sachin's\ncontribution was a useful before he was stumped offleft-arm spinner\nIqbal Qasim. His performance removed any lingering doubt over his\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n\n\n\finclusion in the first Test at the National Stadium, Karachi starting\non  November .\nThere were three significant landmarks for India in this Test. At \nyears and  days, Sachin became the youngest Indian Test player\nand the fourth youngest of all time. Laxman Sivaramakrishnan ( \nyears  days) held the previous Indian record. Salil Ankola made\nhis Test debut in the same match. This was also Kapil Dev's hundredth\nTest match in which he claimed his three hundred and fiftieth Test\nwicket. Before him, only Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar had\nplayed as many matches for India.\nThe match also marked the turning point in the career of\nAzharuddin. He was not <;>riginally scheduled ro play. But Raman\nLamba ruled himself unfit on the morning of the match and Azhar\nwas in. He scored  in both innings and also equalled the world\nfielding record of five catches in an innings.\nAs far as the age record is concerned, three Pakistanis-Mushtaq\nMohammad, Aaqib Javed and Aftab Baloch-were all listed at the\ntime as being younger than Sachin on debut. However, lmran Khan\nhas maintdined that all Pakistani cricketers (except him) have routinely\ntaken two years off their age. Unofficially at least, this made Sachin\nthe youngest in history\u00b7 to play Test cricket. There was another\nsignificant debutant in the match on the Pakistani side-fast bowler\nWagar Younis. The opening day at Karachi was reported to be his\neighteenth birthday.\nIt must have been a strange feeling indeed for a -year-old to\nsuddenly find himself among the big names oflndian cricket. Sachin\nadmitted as much in an interview to Sebastian Coe of Daily Telegraph\n(May ): 'I remember walking into the changing room and\nwondering how I would cope with all the famous names around me\nand they were all about twice my age. My captain, Krish Srikkanth\nwas a great supporter. He sat me down before the game and told me\nthat I belonged in the team, and they were all proud of my achievement.\nNobody made me feel Hke a teenager.'\n_\nSrikkanth won the toss in his first Test as captain and put Pakistan\nin. India had immediate success when Kapil Dev dismissed Aamir\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fMalik for a duck with four runs on the board. By close on the first day,\nPakistan had reached  for  with Javed Miandad () and Imran\n() at the crease. Shoaib Mohammad had shored up the batting with\n. Unfortunately, Sachin's first day in Test cricket was marred by a\nspectator running on to the field and attacking the Indian captain after\nfirst menacing Kapil. The rest of the team grabbed him before security\nofficers took him away, but not before he had torn Srikkanth's shirt.\nMiandad could add only two more the next morning before he\nbecame Kapil's three hundred and fiftieth Test victim. But there was\nno stopping lmran, who recorded his fifth Test century-his third\nagainst India. The Pakistani total of  was a challenging one. It\nassumed huge proportions when India slumped to  for . Wasim\nAkram and Wagar bowled with hostility as Srikkanth, Navjot Singh\nSidhu, Manjrekar and Prabhakar all failed to reach double figures.\nThis was surely a baptism by fire for Tendulkar. As he was to\nremember in Outlook ( January ): There I was in the middle, all\nof  years old, absolutely blank and very nervous, butterflies flying\naround in formations in my stomach! I really didn't know what was\nhappening. Akram was bowling very fast. I think he bowled four\nbouncers in a row. It was very tough and I thought I was not going to\never play Test cricket again. At times I was beaten by pace, the ball\nwent past my bat before I had completed my shot. I made , then a\nhalf-century in the next match. After that I don't remember being\ntroubled by pace as such.'\nIt was a torrid time for the teenager, but he hit  from  balls in\n minutes, including two fours, and was bowled by Younis with the\nscore at  for . In the dressing room, the batsman, perhaps still shellshocked, walked up to Ravi Shastri and said in Marathi, 'Me khup gahi\nkeli' (I was too hasty). Shastri reassured him: 'Young man, you don't\nhave to worry about anything. The fact that you are playing for your\ncountry at  is good enough. Only one thing you must remember.\nWhen you are playing at the highest level, no matter how talented\nyou arc, you must respect the situation on hand.' (Mid Day,  May\n)\nAzhar was lbw to Imran, and India were staring the follow-on\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n\n\n\fsquare in the face at  for .\nThis is where the Indian team showed resilience and fighting spirit\nthat had been sadly lacking on recent tours of Pakistan. By close on\nthe second day, the score had progressed to  without the loss of\nanother wicket as Shastri () and Kapil () began repairing the\ndamage. India still needed  runs to make Pakistan bat again.\nAlthough Kapil could add only six more runs to his overnight , the\ntail wagged effectively and India finished on . Shastri and\nwicketkeeper Kiran More both scored half-centuries and their stand\nensured respectability for the tourists. Still, the lead of  was\nsubstantial and Pakistan enjoyed the upper hand. With two days still\nto play, they added  runs for the loss of three wickets. Shoaib's \nand Salim Malik's unbeaten  helped Imran declare at  for \nand set India the highly improbable task of scoring  in a minim urn\nof overs.\nWagar, who had grabbed four wickets in the first innings in a hostile\nspell, could not bowl in the second because of a strain in the back.\nThat eased the pressure on India. Sidhu's  and Manjrekar's  not\nout meant India finished at  for  and their honour intact in this\nopening encounter. Tendulkar did not get a chance to bat the second\ntime round. But he did have a chance to bowl on his debut, though\nwithout success ( --- and ---).\nWagar was not fit for the second Test which was played at the Iq hal\nStadium in Faisalabad from  November. India brought in mediumpacer Vivek Razdan for his debut in place of Ankola, while Maninder\nreplaced Arshad Ayub. This time, it was the turn oflmran to put the\nopposition in after winning the toss. But his attack was further\nweakened with an injured SaleemJaffar only able to bowl overs in\nthe first innings. Bad light saw only . overs being bowled on the\nopening day and once again the Indian batting was in trouble after a\nuseful opening stand of  between Srikkanth and Sidhu. Azhar failed\nto score, Shastri fell cheaply, and there was another crisis at  for .\nThe Mumbai pair ofManjrekar () and Tendulkar () saw to it\nthat there was no further damage; their stand was worth  at the close\nof the first day. Sachin curbed his natural attacking instincts and batted\n\n\nSachin\n\n\ffor  minutes, perhaps remembering the sound advice given by\nShastri after his dismissal in the first Test. The partnership was extended\nto  the next day and Sachin got his maiden Test half-century in\nonly his second innings. This gave him two world records-he became\nthe youngest to be involved in a century stand and the youngest to\nscore  in a Test match. Sachin had batted for  minutes and \nballs and hit four fours when lmran, bowling at his best in the series so\nfar, had him beaten comprehensively and got him plumb in front for\n.\nIndia's total of appeared inadequate and Pakistan piled up \nfor  declared, with opener Aamir Malik recording his first century.\nSachin took his first catch-Akram caught for  offPrabhakar. The\ndeclaration came  minutes after lunch on the fourth day.\nThe Indian batting came into its own in the second innings as it\nhad at Karachi a week before. Azhar marked his return to form with a\nstreaky  (his first century outside India) while Sidhu, Manjrekar\nand Prabhakar all scored half-centuries as India finished on  for .\nAzhar, not for the first time in his career, was like a cat on a hot tin roof\nin his s and caused jitters in the Indian camp as he almost got four\nbatsmen run out, including himself. Sachin () was one such victim,\nrooted a couple ofyards outside his crease, uncertain whether to respond\ntoAzhar's call for a single when he was on .\nJust  wickets fell in five days in the third Test which began three\ndays later, a match which was instantly dubbed 'the bore at Lahore'.\nMter the excitement of the first two Tests, it proved to be one of those\ntypical Indo-Pak matches played on a feather bed of a wicket, with\nplenty of records but little else. India's total of  saw Manjrekar\nreach his first Test double century, his  the highest against Pakistan\nby an Indian batsman. The total was also India's highest in Pakistan.\nSachin scored  before being bowled by Qadir. Unusually, the off\nand leg stump were disturbed, but the middle was left standing! But\nhis innings was buried under Pakistan's mammoth  for .\nMiandad became the first Pakistani to play  Tests and made the\nevent memorable by scoring a century. This was the same ground\nwhere he had made his debut against New Zealand in  when,\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n\n\n\ftoo, he had registered a century. This made his feat unique. Shoaib's\n not out made him and father Hanif the first father-son combination\nto score Test double centuries, something Sanjay's father Vijay had\nnot been able to achieve.\nThe Indian team was more than satisfied going into the third Test\nat Lahore without a defeat to their name. Despite better performances\nin the first half, Pakistan had been frustrated by India's batting strength,\nwith Manjrekar being the outstanding performer.\nIt would be no different at Sialkot, though for the first time in the\nseries it was India that emerged with the honours. Manjrekar, following\nhis Lahore double-ton, was once again top scorer in the first innings,\nwith . All the batsmen except numbers  and  reached double\nfigures, with Sachin contributing . India took the lead for the first\ntime in the series (and only for the second time in  Tests in Pakistan)\nas Pakistan crumbled to with medium-pacer Vivek Razdan---one\nof Sachin's confidants on the tour-picking up  for  in only his\nsecond Test.\nIndia faced another early-order crisis in their second innings when\nthey lost four wickets for  runs, with Akram picking up three.\nSrikkanth, Manjrekar, Azharuddin and Shastri all fell in single figures.\nThis brought out the best in Sidhu and Tendulkar and they took the\nscore to without further loss at the close of the fourth day, with the\nopener on  and Sachin on . The Pakistani pace attack oflmran,\nWasim and Wagar used the short ball effectively, especially targeting\nthe teenager. But Sachin stood up to everything they could fling at\nhim and even inspired his senior partner. Then, the unexpected\nhappened. A ball from Wagar did not rise as anticipated; it was topedged and struck Sachin on the bridge of his nose. He was wearing a\nhelmet without a grill, which he felt obscured his vision. Blood poured\nfrom the wound as he slumped to the ground and even the normally\nhardened Imran showed his concern. The crowd, perhaps the most\nhostile on tour, was baying for more blood.\nSachin merely threw back his head, pulled out a handkerchief to\nstaunch the blood and carried on bravely. Medical assistance was\nbrushed away. The next delivery, swinging and full pitched, was\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fgloriously square driven for four. The one after that was short outside\nthe off stump. The batsman rose on his toes and the ball was smashed\non the up, past the rooted cover fielder for another boundary. It was a\nstirring performance and the crowd fell silent, stunned and awed in\nequal measure.\nNo one after that would ever doubt Sachin's value to the Indian\ncause. The stand was worth  runs before he was caught behind for\n ( minutes,  balls, five fours) offlmran. Sidhu went on to \nand India were  for  when the match was called off. The result:\nfour draws out of four in the series.\nSachin in an interview to Sportsworld Qanuary ) was to look\nback at that incident as one that added aggression to his armoury.\nReplying to the question, 'How did you develop such an aggressive\noutlook?' he responded: 'It was a good thing that on my first tour I got\nhurt on the nose off a Younis delivery. I realized that there could be\nnothing worse than that. There have been worse injuries than mine.\nBut that gave me more confidence and allowed me to be aggressive in\nmy mind. Even ifl break my nose, I decided on staying there and not\nbe bothered about fast bowling.'\nSo Waqar Younis actually did a favour to Sachin Tendulkar and\nIndian cricket after all! Imran, for his part, claimed he was always\nconscious of bowling to a schoolboy. That 'schoolboy' finished the\nseries with a highly creditable average of. for his  runs, with\ntwo s and a couple of other useful scores besides.\nIn a tribute to him after the Test series, R.Mohan wrote in the\nSportstar ( December ) under the headline 'The Wonder Boy Is\nHere to Stay': 'The gut feeling is that Sachin Tendulkar will go places.\nMuch has been predicted for him by many. The projection is that he\nwill go even further than predicted. There is a quality to his game\nwhich goes beyond the ordinary talk of talent.'\nMohan, then chief cricket correspondent for the Hindu and the\nSportstar, was prescient when he predicted in the same article: 'This is\nno young man who will model his batting on Sunil Gavaskar's. He\nmay go beyond that and think of becoming aViv Richards. He is a\nborn stroke-player.'\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n\n\n\fThe Indian team had emerged with honour intact in the Test series.\nBut there was still the business of the One-day Internationals to be\nnegotiated. Sadly, weather conditions and crowd problems reduced\nthe four-match ODI series to a farce. The opening match at Peshawar\non  December was reduced to an exhibition game of overs per\nside to placate the crowd after a combination of bad light and fog held\nup play. In the second at Gujranwala, only  overs could be played by\neach side because ofbad light and a wet outfield and Pakistan won by\nseven runs. Karachi lived up to its reputation as having the unruliest\ncrowd in Pakistan. The third ODI had to be abandoned as the Indian\nfielders were constantly being pelted by stones. The end came after\njust . overs with Pakistan struggling on  for , Prabhakar having\npicked up all three wickets. Weather once again curtailed play in the\nfourth and final game at Lahore, reduced to  overs per side, which\nPakistan won by  runs.\nEven though the Peshawar opener was not considered an official\nOne-day International, it gave Tendulkar the opportunity to play in\nhis first limited-overs game in national colours. And how he made the\nmost of that opportunity is now part of the Sachin legend.\nSalim Malik with led the charge as Pakistan raced to  for ,\na rate of nearly eight runs per over. Mter losing their first three wickets\nfor , the Indians decided not to exert themselves. Srikkanth had\ndropped himself down the order and appeared to have given up the\nghost when he was joined at the crease by Sachin. The required run\nrate at this stage was over  an over.\nThe fireworks from the young man's bat had even the fiercely\npartisan crowd rooting for him. It all started in leg-spinner Mush tag\nAhmed's second (and final) over in which he was smashed for  runs\nby Sachin: two sixes and a four.\n'Let me see if you can hit my bowling the same way,' Qadir said to\nSachin after Mushtaq's over.\nSachin replied, 'You are such a great bowler, you will not allow me\nto do that.' (Sports Channel video, December )\nQadir got the pasting of a lifetime that evening in Peshawar from\na boy young enough to be his son. Three balls in a row were dispatched\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fwith power and timing over the ropes. Even Qadir applauded as he\nturned and saw the second one soaring over his head. Another was hit\nfor four and the next for three. The over produced an astonishing \nruns as Sachin reached his  from  balls. Srikkanth, one of the\nmost attacking batsmen in the game, was awestruck by his partner's\npower. By now it had come down to  for victory in the final over\nbowled by Akram. The Indians fell short by four runs. Srikkanth was\nleft on  while Tendulkar's contribution was an amazing  not out.\nQadir was generous in his praise. Soon after the thrashing, he told\nthe media: 'The lad is a genius. He is going to take bowlers apart in\ninternational cricket for a very long time.' Qadir had a very clear\nrecollection of the match when asked to look back on it for this book.\n'I did say in  that Tendulkar will be a great batsman. He was a\nschool kid and looked like an innocent boy. But the way he played\nagainst us was enough to convince me that he was going to be a great\nbatsman. I still remember when Wagar Younis bowled him his first\ndelivery when he made his Test debut in Kar<>_chi. It was a very fast\ndelivery. Tendulkar came forward and tried to drive the speedster\nthrough the covers. He didn't connect the ball and was beaten, but I\ntold myself, \"Here is a kid who will make his name in cricket.\"\n'It's a very interesting story (the Peshawar encounter). Firstly I\nwant to clarify that it was not supposed to be an exhibition match. It\nwas actually a One-day International. But it rained heavily in Peshawar.\nThe organizers didn't want to disappoint a large crowd of over ,\nso that's why they decided to convert the One-day International into\nan exhibition match. I tied down skipper Srikkanth and didn't allow\nhim to score freely. At that time, Tendulkar was standing at the nonstriker's end. At the end of the over, I asked Tendulkar to go after my\nbowling, so that the world knows that he has the potential of scoring\nruns against a quality bowler_ It was not that I wanted to bowl him\nloose deliveries, I knew that he could hit me for big sixes. I told him,\n\"Don't feel that a world class leg-spinner is bowling to you. Don't be\nafraid what will happen if you get out, just think that I am an ordinary\nbowler and try to score big sixes.\" When I bowled that memorable\nover, I didn't bowl badly, but Tendulkar hit me for three sixes and in all\nInto the Cauldron of Test Cricket\n\n\n\n\fcollected  runs. I still remember that he was dropped in that over,\nbut it didn't stop him from playing his classical shots to all parts of the\nArbab Niaz Stadium. It was after that match that I said that Tendulkar\nwill be a great batsman and I wasn't wrong because I knew that he\nwould make his name in cricket.\n'A couple of years later I went to Sharjah to play in a double-wicket\ntournament in which leading players like Salim Malik, Arjuna\nRanatunga, Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri and others were playing. Tendulkar\nwas also there. By that time he had made his name in the cricketing\nworld. That day I again asked him to score runs off my bowling. But\nhe didn't succeed in scoring as many as he scored in Peshawar.\n'I love innocent people and those who want to work hard. Tendulkar\nis certainly one of those players.'\nIn the first official One-day International at Gujranwala on \nDecember, Sachin was out for his first duck in international cricket,\ncaught Akram bowled Younis first ball. Quite shockingly; he was\ndropped for the next two matches.\nAt the start of the Test series in Karachi a poster was seen in the\nstands referr:ng to the new kid on the block. It read contemptuously,\nBaccha, tu idhar kya karta hai? (Child, what are you doing here?).\nA month later, at the end of the one-day game at Peshawar, another.\none popped up. It read: Ek sher aya hai (A tiger has arrived).\n\n\n\nSachin\n \nThe Burden Eases\n\nI was surprised and disappointed at the declaration.-Sachin Tendulkar\nafter being stranded on  in the Multan Test match.\nSachin Tendulkar's poor run ofTest match form from the disastrous\ntour to New Zealand carried on when the Kiwis visited India in October\n. This was his first taste of cricket following the World Cup,\nhaving opted out of the TVS one-day tri-series in Bangladesh\nimmediately following the World Cup. It also followed a visit to the\nUnited States for surgery on his right hand, an injury that had troubled\nhim right through his glorious World Cup run.\nScores of, ,  and  in the two Tests against New Zealand were\nfollowed by a splendid run in the ODI tri-series with Australia and\nNew Zealand. But two centuries and two s in the preliminary games\nwere followed by an unenterprising  in the final against Australia at\nKolkata which India lost by  runs. The ghost of the World Cup was\nback to haunt India.\nIndia under Tendulkar's captaincy had been whitewashed -\nwhen they last toured Australia in -. But it was a different\nteam and a different captain four years later when India were back\nDown Under for another gripping Test series.\nAustralia were the undisputed world champions in both forms of\nthe game and few gave the Indians much chance, given their abysmal\ntrack record on foreign soil.\nBut at the end of the series India were the moral victors as Australia\nhung on for a draw in the fourth and final Test at Sydney with the\nseries locked at -.\n\n\fIt was at Sydney, where he had made such an impact as a teenager\non his first visit in -, that Tendulkar finally came out of his\nTest match slump.\nRight through the series he had been overshadowed by the\nawesome form ofDravid, Laxman, Sehwag and Ganguly with even\nrookie Aakash Chopra being more consistent.\nScores ofO, , , and  had his fans dejected. In the third Test at\nMelbourne he was even shielded by Ganguly in the second innings,\ncoming in at number five.\nNow at Sydney he finally reached three figures for the first time\nsince the Kolkata Test against the West Indies in November seven Tests without a century.\nTendulkar eschewed all risks, cutting out virtually all off-side shots\nin a remarkable display of self-restraint. Of his  not out,  came\non the on-side in an innings stretching to over  hours, his longestever stint at the crease.\nJust for good measure he added  not out in the second innings to\nclimb to third in the averages behind the in-form Dravid and\nLaxman-but  of his  runs from his seven innings had come in\nthe final Test.\nThe two finals of the tri-series (with Zimbabwe as the third team)\nsaw India trounced by Australia for the third time in less than twelve\nmonths in the final of an  tournament. Tendulkar's scores of\nand  meant he had failed once again to rise to the big occasion.\nThe tour to Pakistan in early  had been on the minds of the\nIndian team even as they were battling away in the om series in\nAustralia. The safety concerns were naturally uppermost in their minds.\nIn the event it turned out be a hugely successful visit, both on and\noff the field. For the first time in over  years India won a Test match\n(and series) in Pakistan, and the  series too for good measure.\nTendulkar was the only player in the touring side to have played a\nTest match in Pakistan, having made his debut there in .\nHis major contribution in the  series was a fabulous  in a\nlosing cause in the third match at Rawalpindi, the first  century by\nan Indian batsman in Pakistan. The series went - in India's favour.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fThe Indian batting was in form in the first Test at Multan, carrying\non from where they had left off at Sydney just a couple of months\nearlier.\nSehwag became the first Indian cricketer to score a Test triple\ncentury, adding  for the third wicket with Tendulkar. The talking\npoint of the match was not only Sehwag's feat and India's win by an\ninnings and  runs but Tendulkar's public reaction to stand-in captain\nRahul Dravid's declaration with his score on .\nIt puzzled even his most ardent supporters that he should express\n'surprise and disappointment' at a decision that was after all for the\nbenefit of the team. It was his rd Test century, placing him just one\nbehind the world record held by Sunil Gavaskar.\nWhen India were well beaten in the second Test at Lahore it looked\nlike that elusive foreign series win would continue to evade the grasp\nof the Indian team.\nIt was fitting then that the final Pakistani batsman to fall in the\nthird and final Test at Rawalpindi should have been caught by captain\nGanguly off the bowling ofTendulkar.\nIt had been  long years since India had won a series away from\nhome, beating Sri Lanka - in , with only Ani! Kumble and\nTendulkar surviving from that era.\nFor the rest of the side it was a heady and intoxicating feeling. India\nhad now established themselves as the second best team in the world\nbehind Australia both in Tests and oms. And finally after nearly a\ndecade of carrying the Indian batting on his shoulders, the burden\nand pressures had eased for Tendulkar with Laxman, Dravid and\nSehwag emerging as world-class batsmen.\n\nThe Burden Eases\n\n  Runs Short of Glory\n\nI cried so much when I was out I could not see.-Sachin Tendulkar\nA month later, the Indian team were in New Zealand under a new\ncaptain, Mohammad Azharuddin, and a new coach, Bishan Singh\nBedi. The team had a fresh, youthful look to it-it was, as Raj Singh\nwould describe it, the 'team for the s'. Tendulkar scored , , \n(not out) and  in the two warm-up games prior to the first Test at\nLancaster Park, Christchurch. And in the first innings against New\nZealand President's XI at Pukekura Park, New Plymouth on \nJanuary , he became the youngest to reach the landmark of\nfirst-class runs.\nIt was a miserable batting performance by the visitors in the first\nTest at Christchurch as they were beaten by ten wickets with Tendulkar\nout for his first duck in Test cricket, in the first innings. Of the Indian\nplayers, only Kapil Dev had previous playing experience in New\nZealand. India crumbled to  all out in reply to New Zealand's \nand, following on, could muster only  (Tendulkar: ). Sir Richard\nHadlee became the first bowler in Test cricket to reach the landmark\nof  wickets when he bowled Manjrekar in the second innings.\nHadlee was arguably the best bowler in the world at the time and\nfacing him at such an early stage of his career was an education for\nSachin. He felt that Hadlee was the kind ofbowler who made batsmen\nthink all the time and after only his second tour, rated the Kiwi master\nas the best bowler he had faced till then.\nMter that early setback, the Indian batting clicked in the second\nTest at Napier where over two days were lost to rain and a draw was the\n\n\fonly verdict possible. W V Raman was out to Hadlee off the first ball\nof the match and it was Prabhakar () and Manjrekar () who did\nthe early repair work, adding  for the second wicket. Azharuddin\nchipped in with  and his departure brought Tendulkar in at  for\n. Bo!h Vengsarkar and Kapil came and went cheaply, and when\nwicketkeeper Kiran More joined Sachin at the crease, the score read\n for . More () played the dominant role as he and Tendulkar\nput together a record seventh-wicket stand worth  runs. Several\nairy-fairy shots outside off stump marked the early part ofTendulkar's\ninnings and he could have been out on numerous occasions. But his\nboyishness faded away gradually, and the longer he stayed at the wicket,\nthe more decisive he grew. By the close of the third day India were \nfor  and Tendulkar had batted five hours for his unbeaten . All the\nspeculation overnight centred on whether the long-standing record\nset by Pakistan's Mushtaq Mohammed.against India in -, for\nthe youngest Test century-maker, would be broken on the fourth day.\nMushtaq was  years and  days when he reached his maiden century\nin Delhi. Sachin was still two months shy ofhis seventeenth birthday.\nA teammate, unnamed by Sachin, perhaps added to the pressure\nwhen he told the not-out batsman that he was  runs short ofhistory\nas he returned to the dressing room that evening.\nThe next morning, the first ball of the day from Danny Morrison\nwas dispatched to the cover boundary and then Sachin ran four runs\nto a shot to deep mid-off as he moved quickly to . Perhaps overconfidence and youthful exuberance got the better ofhim, for the very\nnext ball was driven firmly but uppishly to captain John Wright at\nmid-off who took a ccmfortable catch on one knee. Sachin had batted\nfor  minutes, faced  balls and hit four boundaries. 'I cried so\nmuch when I was out, I could not see. The entire team consoled me,'\nsaid Sachin. 'I could have worked my way to the century. I suppose I\ngot carried away, wanting to take on the bowler.' (Sports Channel video,\nDecember )\n'I had two feelings when I caught him,' recalls Wright, now coach\nof the Indian team. 'Firstly one of relief, as at the time I was captain of\nNew Zealand and he was batting so beautifully we looked like we\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fwould never get him out. It was the second Test and we had won the\nfirst. My second feeling was one of almost feeling sorry for him as he\nwas only a lad really and he had batted so well and deserved a century....\nI was surprised, as he had hit the ball in the air, it was an easy catch and\nit came straight to me at mid-off.'\n'[Sachin's innings] left experienced members of the New Zealand\nteam agog,' wrote Don Neely, the convenor of the New Zealand\nselection panel, in the New Zealand CricketAlmanack ( ).\nThe third Test at Auckland, a high-scoring match in which\nTendulkar could score only five, was also drawn and New Zealand\nwon the series -. There was no second chance at the record for the\nyoungest Test centurion as the next Test series (against England), was\nfive months away.\nThe Auckland Test was followed by a one-day tri-series also\ninvolving Australia.

These were his first runs in One-day Internationals. India\nhad to beat Australia in the next match two days later at Hamilton if\nthey were to make the final.

Mter that early\nlapse, nothing got past Gooch's bat which assumed ever-larger\nproportions for the toiling Indian attack. He reached the first triple\ncentury in a Test at Lord's and now Garry Sobers' world record of\nnot out was in his sights. But the -year-old was beginning to feel the\nfatigue of an innings of more than ten hours. Mter adding  with\nRobin Smith, he was out to a tired stroke, bowled by Prabhakar for\n. England declared at  for  as soon as Smith reached three\nfigures and the Indian openers, Shastri and Sidhu, held on to score \nby the end of the second day. India used five bowlers during England's\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fonslaught and all save Shastri-who gave away -conceded more\nthan  runs. The target was now clear:  to avoid the follow-on.\nAnd India did indeed reach that score in a glorious manner.\nShastri held the top order together with a determined .\nVengsarkar, who had scored hundreds in each of his previous three\nTests at Lord's, this time contributed . But at  for , the follow-on\nwas still looming large.

Now it was up to the captain to\natone for his blunder with the toss. He did so in the only way he knew,\nunleashing a torrent of dazzling strokes that had the English bowlers\nwringing their hands in despair and the media singing his praises.\nOnce Azhar was bowled by Eddie Hemmings for , it was left to\nKapil to make England bat again. With nine wickets down and only\nHirwani for company, it was a do-or-die situation. Hemmings was\nthe bowler, and in four deliveries the follow-on had been saved in\nastonishing fashion-all four balls were sent over the boundary for\nsix!\nEngland raced to  for  declared to set an impossible target for\nIndia. Gooch entered the record books once again as the only batsman\nin the history of first-class cricket to score a triple and single century\nin the same match. The Indians, the second time round, could not\nrepeat their first-innings heroics and crumbled to  all out to lose\nby  runs. Tendulkar displayed rare application in an innings of\nin which he struck four boundaries. He occupied the crease for \nminutes, showed copybook technique and was willing to wait for the\nloose ball. But he got one from Fraser that took off from a good length\nspot and was caught at slip by Gooch.\nThe match produced a record for the most runs in a Lord's Testan amazing  at more than four runs an over. It was glorious\nentertainment for the spectators. And amidst all the landmarks and\nachievements recorded by both sides, there was one moment that is\nremembered clearly even today by those who witnessed it. Lamb,\nbatting in the second innings, had clouted Hirwani, but slightly\nmiscued the drive. Tendulkar raced across from the wide long off\nHail the Boy Kin.\n\n\n\n\fboundary, past the sight screen where the ball was heading. It was a\n-yard dash worthy of a Carl Lewis. As the ball dipped seemingly out\nofhis grasp, he thrust out his right hand and the ball stuck in his palm.\nA lV commentator gushed, 'Oh my goodness gracious me. He didn't\nlook like he had any chance of reaching it.' Harsha Bhogle, writing in\nMid Day, called it 'the greatest catch I have ever seen'. John Thicknesse,\nin Wisden Cricketers' Almanack () called it 'as wonderful an outfield\ncatch as Lord's has seen'. David Frith in f..Visden Cricket Monthly\n(September ) called it 'An amazing one-hander which deserved\nisolated billing in a meaningless drawn match rather than inclusion\namong such competing headlines.' Only someone of Tendulkar's\nyouthful exuberance would have attempted such a catch, let alone\nsuccessfully executed it.\nThe three-day game against Gloucestershire at Bristol,just before\nthe second Test, finished in a draw. Tendulkar's scores were  and .\nHe was also given his first long spell of bowling on the tour, indeed in\nhis entire first-class career to date. In  overs in Gloucestershire's\nfirst innings, he picked up the wickets of Hodgson, Romaines and\nAlleyne, three top order batsmen, for  runs. This was after left-arm\nspinner Raju had ended his tour with a broken hand while batting in\nthe first innings.\nThe second Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, which started on \nAugust would finally see the promise of youth translate into a display\nof greatness-a match-saving century from the youngest Test cricketer\nin the world. Centuries from Gooch-his third in succession-and\nfellow opener Atherton saw England finish the opening day on \nfor , inducing a sense of deja vu among the Indian bowlers who had\nsuffered a similar pasting at Lord's less than two weeks ago. Smith\nweighed in with a ton and England's massive score of once again\nmeant that India could only hope to save the Test match. They found\nthemselves on shaky ground at the end of the second day, with the first\nthree wickets falling for . But Azhar took over from where he had\nleft off at Lord's, and his domination of the bowling was such that the\nEnglish attack was made to look pedestrian. His  was his third\ncentury in successive Tests as captain, something no Indian captain\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fhad achieved. His -run stand with Manjrekar () took the score\nto  for  and was followed by another worth  for the fifth wicket\nwith Tendulkar. The captain was around to guide the young man\nthrough a tricky initial period at the crease. It took Sachin  minutes\nand  balls to get his first run. His contribution to the century\npartnership was _iust  as Azhar ran amok. But with the last five\nwickets going down for , his innings of  (eight fours) in \nminutes was enough to see England's lead cut to a manageable \nruns. It was also Tendulkar's highest score so far in Tests. A mark that\nwould be obliterated just two days later.\nGooch failed for the first time in the series in the second innings,\nbut England's  for  left India with a huge task ahead of them. To\nwin, they needed  runs from a minimum of  overs. Sidhu's\ndismissal for a duck saw the top order crumble for the second time in\nthe match, and now the only thought was of survival. Defeat here\nwould reduce the third and final Test at the Oval to a formality. When\nPrabhakar joined Tendulkar at  for , there were still two and a half\nhours remaining for England's bowlers to mop things up. But their\nfielders muffed two chances that would have sewn up the match and\nthe series. Hemmings dropped a sitter off his own bowling from\nTendulkar at ten and Gooch floored Prabhakar at slip. That was all the\npair needed. Tendulkar was watchful, considering the perilous position\nthe team was in. But he did not fail to punish the loose ball and reached\nhis second half-century of the Test from  balls. The landmark was\nreached with three shots to the boundary off Chris Lewis in one over.\nAt the start of the last  overs, the score was  for  and the field\nwas still an attacking one. Tendulkar off-drove Fraser for four, then\ncut him high and hard over the waiting slip cordon for another, to\nmove into his s. An elegant back-foot boundary offFraser took him\nto  and then at  there was just that tiny sign of nerves as he ducked\nFraser and left his bat sticking up, getting a single to long leg in the\nprocess. Another off drive for three runs, and the magic moment had\narrived. Sachin's maiden century had taken  balls,  of which had\nbeen crisply dispatched to the boundary.\nWith a shy half-smile he lifted his helmet to acknowledge the\nHail the Boy King\n\n\n\n\fapplause from the small crowd and a frenzied Indian dressing room\nwhere his mentor Sunil Gavaskar had raced from the commentary\nbox to witness the moment. Sachin was too young to vote, too young\nto drink alcohol, too young to sign his contract with the Board which\nhis father had done for him less than  months ago. But not too\nyoung to save his side in battle, overshadowing his teammates, some\nalmost twice his age, who had recklessly thrown away their wickets\non the final day. The line between prodigy and genius-the word\nDennis Compton used to describe him-had been crossed in only his\nninth Test.\nThe stand with Prabhakar was worth an unbroken , the allrounder not out on . And despite the five other centuries in a Test\ndominated by the batsmen, the critics had eyes only for the sixth and\nlast one. In all, Tendulkar had batted for  minutes, faced  balls\nand struck  boundaries. It made him at  years and  days the\nyoungest to score a Test century in England and the second youngest\never. Fraser, the pick of the bowlers at Old Trafford and the most\nsuccessful in a series awash with centuries, told Scyld Berry ofWisden\nCricket Monthly Oune ), 'He never looked raw or out of place,\neven at Lord's in the first Test. Some batsmen come in and freeze or\nseem unsure, but not him-not that he was cocky. It just didn't feel as\nif you were bowling to a  -year-old. His temperament allowed the\ntalent to flow.'\n'Fraser Denied by Tendulkar's Breathtaking Brilliance' was the\nheadline in the Cricketer International (October ). Wrote\nChristopher Martin-] enkins, 'Coming in at  for , with Hemmings\nturning the ball and Lewis fresh and firing, Tendulkar batted with\nquite astounding skill and composure.' The headline to David Frith's\nreport in Wisden Cricket Monthly (October ) proclaimed a new\nbatting master on the world stage: 'Hail the Boy King'.\nFounder and former editor ofwcM (and editor of the Cricketer\nInternational before that), author of over  books on cricket and one of\nthe game's greatest historians, Frith readily agreed to contribute his\nmemories of one of cricket's finest batting displays.\n'It was a considerable privilege to have witnessed Sachin\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's maiden Test hundred. Although the England attack was\nscarcely the greatest ever fielded by that country, there was a crisis to\nbe overcome on the final afternoon when India, needing  to win\nafter Gooch's declaration, had slipped to  for . Tendulkar had\nfailed at Lord's in the first Test but had scored  in the first innings\nhere at Manchester. Now he showed astonishing maturity in batting\nfor almost four hours to make  not out, his match-saving stand\nwith Prabhakar realizing . He was only  years and  daysthe second-youngest Test centurion, after Mushtaq Mohammadand we wondered what he might be capable of doing in the next ten\nyears or so.\n'Reverting to my notes from that Test match, I find the sense of\nwonder was real. How could anyone so young be so good at the highest\nlevel? He was wearing Sunil Gavaskar's off-white fibreglass pads,\nwhich made him appear to waddle rather like one of television's cuddly\ntoys. His first innings in this match was worth , and he had had to\nstruggle for almost an hour for his first run. That, for a start, told us\nsomething important about him. He stayed with his captain,\nAzharuddin, through a century stand, and finally gave his wicket\naway after three and a half hours at the crease. Most notable innings\nowe almost everything to a fielding error. In his second-innings century\nTendulkar escaped a chest-high caught-and-bowled to off-spinner\nEddie Hemmings when he was only . He inside-edged the next\nball, as England piled on the pressure, but emerged to play calmly and\nreassuringly.\n'India really had seemed doomed. Kapil Dev got out to a wild shot,\ncausing one of my neighbouring writers, a senior from India, to slap\nhis forehead and exclaim, \"Oh, my God!\" That's how bad it was. But\nyoung Tendulkar stood solid, and so did Prabhakar. The youngster\neven showed himself to be street-smart, for almost every time the\nbowler turned, preparing to bowl, he was still studying the field, or\nadjusting his gear, or marking his crease. With the fielders clustered\naround him like members of the fan club that was soon to make his\nlife difficult, Tendulkar dealt with everything England dished out,\ndriving powerfully and cutting like a flash. The hundred came with\nHail the Boy King\n\n]\n\n\fan off-drive for three off Angus Fraser. I was quite affected by this\nwonderful performance from one so young. He saw India to safety,\nand half-an-hour later, he was stepping forward in the pavilion to\nreceive his Man of the Match award. Under the glare of the spotlights\nhe gave the first discernible sign of nervousness. His lower lip seemed\nto tremble as he stepped forward to receive his magnum of champagne,\nand he was soon explaining that he was too young to drink.\n'At the press conference which followed, he replied to the kindly,\nalmost patronising questions in a quiet voice, one which had not as\nyet fully broken. Always prepared to gaze into years distant-past or\nfuture-I simply had to write: ''A smile came readily to his unrazored\nface, and already those with rich imaginations were envisaging the\nsophisticated grown-up face and the deeper voice which would respond\nto questions at some far-distant press conference to mark his breaking\nof Gavaskar's Test records.\" The young prodigy had helped India\nturn the tide in the match, transforming the seemingly inevitable\ndisappointment of millions into jubilation at his wondrous act. The\nfinest compliment of all probably came from England's dour skipper\nGooch: \"He played like an old pro.\"'\nSaid Richie Benaud on TV after Tendulkar had received his award\nfrom David Lloyd: We'll see a lot more centuries from his bat. I hope\nI'll be around to see them.' Bedi commented, 'He applied himself\nmagnificently and showed maturity beyond comprehension.' Bedi\ntold me he had observed during the tour that even Bradman at that\nage was no match for Sachin. 'Of course, the white cricket world was\nnot too pleased with that statement. And as it turned out, by the time\nSachin reached his s, he was way behind what Bradman had\nachieved at that age with his numerous double and triple centuries.'\nThe Indian manager by then had made quite a name for himself\nwith his numerous controversial comments. One such must have\nbeen acutely embarrassing to Sachin himself. 'The English media\nreported that I said that every Englishwoman would like to seduce\nSachin. Actually I said they would like to mother him. At that age he\nwas so adorable,' Bedi clarified to me.\nMter all that excitement, the third and final Test at the Oval was\n\n\nSachin\n\n\falmost anticlimactic. This would be the high noon for the Indian\nbatting machine, at a ground with happy memories for the country.\n(India's first Test victory in England was at the Oval in .) Never\nbefore had India scored over  against England and for the first time\nat home England were forced to follow-on against India. The massive\ntotal of  for  declared was built around opener Shastri's  and\nKapil Dev's . AJI but number ten Hirwani reached double figures\nand there were s for Azhar and More as well. Tendulkar was out to\ndebutant medium-pacer Neil Williams for  (including three\nboundaries), slashing to Lamb a.t first slip. England followed on after\ntrailing by  runs. But any hopes India may have harboured of\nforcing victory were thwarted by Gooch ( in both innings) and a\nmajestic unbeaten  by David Gower. Gooch garnered over \nTest runs over the summer, including three Tests earlier in the season\nagainst New Zealand. Tendulkar was third in the averages with \nruns at ., after Azhar and Shastri. It was a summer full of tons and\nruns and yet it was Tendulkar's match-saving knock at Old Trafford\nthat continued to be the talking point of the year.\nThere was the formality of one more first-class match to be gone\nthrough before the Indians could fly home after a tour lasting two\nmonths. It was a privately arranged match by TV personality and\njournalist Michael Parkinson, played in the festive atmosphere of\nScarborough, but it was a first-class game nonetheless. The match\nwas billed as Michael Parkinson's World XI v Indians and ended in a\ndraw. The World team was a motley bunch, including Kiwi Mark\nGreatbatch (who slammed unbeaten centuries in both innings),\nMudassar Nazar, Gordon Greenidge (the captain) and Chetan Sharma.\nThe Indians were set to score  in four and a half hours and in a\nvirtual replay of the last day at Old Trafford, once again it was Tendulkar\nwho saw them to the safety of a draw with  not out. The bowling\nattack in the hands ofEzra Moseley, Mike Whitney, Meyrick Pringle,\nChetan Sharma, Roger Harper and Peter Sleep was nothing to sneeze\nat. The century was reached from  balls, including  fours, and\nwas the perfect end to a perfect summer ofbatting.\nTendulkar finished with the highest aggregate for the touring side,\nHail the Boy King\n\n\n\n\fwith  runs from  matches ( innings) at the impressive average\nof. This included two centuries and six s. There was also a century\nin the one-day game against Derbyshire. As in the Test series, only\nAzhar and Shastri finished ahead ofSachin in the tour averages.\nThe tour of England was a huge step forward in the cricket\neducation ofTendulkar. Now he had other worlds to conquer.\n\n\n\nSachin \nHail the Boy King\n\nHe played like an old pro.-Graham Gooch\nDespite three half-centuries in his first six Test matches, there was\nsome speculation that Tendulkar would be dropped for the tour of\nEngland in the summer of .

Hemmings was\nthe bowler, and in four deliveries the follow-on had been saved in\nastonishing fashion-all four balls were sent over the boundary for\nsix!\nEngland raced to  for  declared to set an impossible target for\nIndia. Gooch entered the record books once again as the only batsman\nin the history of first-class cricket to score a triple and single century\nin the same match. The Indians, the second time round, could not\nrepeat their first-innings heroics and crumbled to  all out to lose\nby  runs. Tendulkar displayed rare application in an innings of\nin which he struck four boundaries. He occupied the crease for \nminutes, showed copybook technique and was willing to wait for the\nloose ball. But he got one from Fraser that took off from a good length\nspot and was caught at slip by Gooch.\nThe match produced a record for the most runs in a Lord's Testan amazing  at more than four runs an over. It was glorious\nentertainment for the spectators. And amidst all the landmarks and\nachievements recorded by both sides, there was one moment that is\nremembered clearly even today by those who witnessed it. Lamb,\nbatting in the second innings, had clouted Hirwani, but slightly\nmiscued the drive. Tendulkar raced across from the wide long off\nHail the Boy Kin.\n\n\n\n\fboundary, past the sight screen where the ball was heading. It was a\n-yard dash worthy of a Carl Lewis. As the ball dipped seemingly out\nofhis grasp, he thrust out his right hand and the ball stuck in his palm.\nA lV commentator gushed, 'Oh my goodness gracious me. He didn't\nlook like he had any chance of reaching it.' Harsha Bhogle, writing in\nMid Day, called it 'the greatest catch I have ever seen'. John Thicknesse,\nin Wisden Cricketers' Almanack () called it 'as wonderful an outfield\ncatch as Lord's has seen'. David Frith in f..Visden Cricket Monthly\n(September ) called it 'An amazing one-hander which deserved\nisolated billing in a meaningless drawn match rather than inclusion\namong such competing headlines.' Only someone of Tendulkar's\nyouthful exuberance would have attempted such a catch, let alone\nsuccessfully executed it.\nThe three-day game against Gloucestershire at Bristol,just before\nthe second Test, finished in a draw. Tendulkar's scores were  and .\nHe was also given his first long spell of bowling on the tour, indeed in\nhis entire first-class career to date. In  overs in Gloucestershire's\nfirst innings, he picked up the wickets of Hodgson, Romaines and\nAlleyne, three top order batsmen, for  runs. This was after left-arm\nspinner Raju had ended his tour with a broken hand while batting in\nthe first innings.\nThe second Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, which started on \nAugust would finally see the promise of youth translate into a display\nof greatness-a match-saving century from the youngest Test cricketer\nin the world. Centuries from Gooch-his third in succession-and\nfellow opener Atherton saw England finish the opening day on \nfor , inducing a sense of deja vu among the Indian bowlers who had\nsuffered a similar pasting at Lord's less than two weeks ago. Smith\nweighed in with a ton and England's massive score of once again\nmeant that India could only hope to save the Test match. They found\nthemselves on shaky ground at the end of the second day, with the first\nthree wickets falling for . But Azhar took over from where he had\nleft off at Lord's, and his domination of the bowling was such that the\nEnglish attack was made to look pedestrian. His  was his third\ncentury in successive Tests as captain, something no Indian captain\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fhad achieved. His -run stand with Manjrekar () took the score\nto  for  and was followed by another worth  for the fifth wicket\nwith Tendulkar. The captain was around to guide the young man\nthrough a tricky initial period at the crease. It took Sachin  minutes\nand  balls to get his first run. His contribution to the century\npartnership was _iust  as Azhar ran amok. But with the last five\nwickets going down for , his innings of  (eight fours) in \nminutes was enough to see England's lead cut to a manageable \nruns. It was also Tendulkar's highest score so far in Tests. A mark that\nwould be obliterated just two days later.\nGooch failed for the first time in the series in the second innings,\nbut England's  for  left India with a huge task ahead of them. To\nwin, they needed  runs from a minimum of  overs. Sidhu's\ndismissal for a duck saw the top order crumble for the second time in\nthe match, and now the only thought was of survival. Defeat here\nwould reduce the third and final Test at the Oval to a formality. When\nPrabhakar joined Tendulkar at  for , there were still two and a half\nhours remaining for England's bowlers to mop things up. But their\nfielders muffed two chances that would have sewn up the match and\nthe series. Hemmings dropped a sitter off his own bowling from\nTendulkar at ten and Gooch floored Prabhakar at slip. That was all the\npair needed. Tendulkar was watchful, considering the perilous position\nthe team was in. But he did not fail to punish the loose ball and reached\nhis second half-century of the Test from  balls. The landmark was\nreached with three shots to the boundary off Chris Lewis in one over.\nAt the start of the last  overs, the score was  for  and the field\nwas still an attacking one. Tendulkar off-drove Fraser for four, then\ncut him high and hard over the waiting slip cordon for another, to\nmove into his s. An elegant back-foot boundary offFraser took him\nto  and then at  there was just that tiny sign of nerves as he ducked\nFraser and left his bat sticking up, getting a single to long leg in the\nprocess. Another off drive for three runs, and the magic moment had\narrived. Sachin's maiden century had taken  balls,  of which had\nbeen crisply dispatched to the boundary.\nWith a shy half-smile he lifted his helmet to acknowledge the\nHail the Boy King\n\n\n\n\fapplause from the small crowd and a frenzied Indian dressing room\nwhere his mentor Sunil Gavaskar had raced from the commentary\nbox to witness the moment. Sachin was too young to vote, too young\nto drink alcohol, too young to sign his contract with the Board which\nhis father had done for him less than  months ago. But not too\nyoung to save his side in battle, overshadowing his teammates, some\nalmost twice his age, who had recklessly thrown away their wickets\non the final day. The line between prodigy and genius-the word\nDennis Compton used to describe him-had been crossed in only his\nninth Test.\nThe stand with Prabhakar was worth an unbroken , the allrounder not out on . And despite the five other centuries in a Test\ndominated by the batsmen, the critics had eyes only for the sixth and\nlast one. In all, Tendulkar had batted for  minutes, faced  balls\nand struck  boundaries. It made him at  years and  days the\nyoungest to score a Test century in England and the second youngest\never. Fraser, the pick of the bowlers at Old Trafford and the most\nsuccessful in a series awash with centuries, told Scyld Berry ofWisden\nCricket Monthly Oune ), 'He never looked raw or out of place,\neven at Lord's in the first Test. Some batsmen come in and freeze or\nseem unsure, but not him-not that he was cocky. It just didn't feel as\nif you were bowling to a  -year-old. His temperament allowed the\ntalent to flow.'\n'Fraser Denied by Tendulkar's Breathtaking Brilliance' was the\nheadline in the Cricketer International (October ). Wrote\nChristopher Martin-] enkins, 'Coming in at  for , with Hemmings\nturning the ball and Lewis fresh and firing, Tendulkar batted with\nquite astounding skill and composure.' The headline to David Frith's\nreport in Wisden Cricket Monthly (October ) proclaimed a new\nbatting master on the world stage: 'Hail the Boy King'.\nFounder and former editor ofwcM (and editor of the Cricketer\nInternational before that), author of over  books on cricket and one of\nthe game's greatest historians, Frith readily agreed to contribute his\nmemories of one of cricket's finest batting displays.\n'It was a considerable privilege to have witnessed Sachin\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's maiden Test hundred. Although the England attack was\nscarcely the greatest ever fielded by that country, there was a crisis to\nbe overcome on the final afternoon when India, needing  to win\nafter Gooch's declaration, had slipped to  for . Tendulkar had\nfailed at Lord's in the first Test but had scored  in the first innings\nhere at Manchester. Now he showed astonishing maturity in batting\nfor almost four hours to make  not out, his match-saving stand\nwith Prabhakar realizing . He was only  years and  daysthe second-youngest Test centurion, after Mushtaq Mohammadand we wondered what he might be capable of doing in the next ten\nyears or so.\n'Reverting to my notes from that Test match, I find the sense of\nwonder was real. How could anyone so young be so good at the highest\nlevel? He was wearing Sunil Gavaskar's off-white fibreglass pads,\nwhich made him appear to waddle rather like one of television's cuddly\ntoys. His first innings in this match was worth , and he had had to\nstruggle for almost an hour for his first run. That, for a start, told us\nsomething important about him. He stayed with his captain,\nAzharuddin, through a century stand, and finally gave his wicket\naway after three and a half hours at the crease. Most notable innings\nowe almost everything to a fielding error. In his second-innings century\nTendulkar escaped a chest-high caught-and-bowled to off-spinner\nEddie Hemmings when he was only . He inside-edged the next\nball, as England piled on the pressure, but emerged to play calmly and\nreassuringly.\n'India really had seemed doomed. Kapil Dev got out to a wild shot,\ncausing one of my neighbouring writers, a senior from India, to slap\nhis forehead and exclaim, \"Oh, my God!\" That's how bad it was. But\nyoung Tendulkar stood solid, and so did Prabhakar. The youngster\neven showed himself to be street-smart, for almost every time the\nbowler turned, preparing to bowl, he was still studying the field, or\nadjusting his gear, or marking his crease. With the fielders clustered\naround him like members of the fan club that was soon to make his\nlife difficult, Tendulkar dealt with everything England dished out,\ndriving powerfully and cutting like a flash. The hundred came with\nHail the Boy King\n\n]\n\n\fan off-drive for three off Angus Fraser. I was quite affected by this\nwonderful performance from one so young. He saw India to safety,\nand half-an-hour later, he was stepping forward in the pavilion to\nreceive his Man of the Match award. Under the glare of the spotlights\nhe gave the first discernible sign of nervousness. His lower lip seemed\nto tremble as he stepped forward to receive his magnum of champagne,\nand he was soon explaining that he was too young to drink.\n'At the press conference which followed, he replied to the kindly,\nalmost patronising questions in a quiet voice, one which had not as\nyet fully broken. Always prepared to gaze into years distant-past or\nfuture-I simply had to write: ''A smile came readily to his unrazored\nface, and already those with rich imaginations were envisaging the\nsophisticated grown-up face and the deeper voice which would respond\nto questions at some far-distant press conference to mark his breaking\nof Gavaskar's Test records.\" The young prodigy had helped India\nturn the tide in the match, transforming the seemingly inevitable\ndisappointment of millions into jubilation at his wondrous act. The\nfinest compliment of all probably came from England's dour skipper\nGooch: \"He played like an old pro.\"'\nSaid Richie Benaud on TV after Tendulkar had received his award\nfrom David Lloyd: We'll see a lot more centuries from his bat. I hope\nI'll be around to see them.' Bedi commented, 'He applied himself\nmagnificently and showed maturity beyond comprehension.' Bedi\ntold me he had observed during the tour that even Bradman at that\nage was no match for Sachin. 'Of course, the white cricket world was\nnot too pleased with that statement. And as it turned out, by the time\nSachin reached his s, he was way behind what Bradman had\nachieved at that age with his numerous double and triple centuries.'\nThe Indian manager by then had made quite a name for himself\nwith his numerous controversial comments. One such must have\nbeen acutely embarrassing to Sachin himself. 'The English media\nreported that I said that every Englishwoman would like to seduce\nSachin. Actually I said they would like to mother him. At that age he\nwas so adorable,' Bedi clarified to me.\nMter all that excitement, the third and final Test at the Oval was\n\n\nSachin\n\n\falmost anticlimactic. This would be the high noon for the Indian\nbatting machine, at a ground with happy memories for the country.\n(India's first Test victory in England was at the Oval in .) Never\nbefore had India scored over  against England and for the first time\nat home England were forced to follow-on against India. The massive\ntotal of  for  declared was built around opener Shastri's  and\nKapil Dev's . AJI but number ten Hirwani reached double figures\nand there were s for Azhar and More as well. Tendulkar was out to\ndebutant medium-pacer Neil Williams for  (including three\nboundaries), slashing to Lamb a.t first slip. England followed on after\ntrailing by  runs. But any hopes India may have harboured of\nforcing victory were thwarted by Gooch ( in both innings) and a\nmajestic unbeaten  by David Gower. Gooch garnered over \nTest runs over the summer, including three Tests earlier in the season\nagainst New Zealand. Tendulkar was third in the averages with \nruns at ., after Azhar and Shastri. It was a summer full of tons and\nruns and yet it was Tendulkar's match-saving knock at Old Trafford\nthat continued to be the talking point of the year.\nThere was the formality of one more first-class match to be gone\nthrough before the Indians could fly home after a tour lasting two\nmonths. It was a privately arranged match by TV personality and\njournalist Michael Parkinson, played in the festive atmosphere of\nScarborough, but it was a first-class game nonetheless. The match\nwas billed as Michael Parkinson's World XI v Indians and ended in a\ndraw. The World team was a motley bunch, including Kiwi Mark\nGreatbatch (who slammed unbeaten centuries in both innings),\nMudassar Nazar, Gordon Greenidge (the captain) and Chetan Sharma.\nThe Indians were set to score  in four and a half hours and in a\nvirtual replay of the last day at Old Trafford, once again it was Tendulkar\nwho saw them to the safety of a draw with  not out. The bowling\nattack in the hands ofEzra Moseley, Mike Whitney, Meyrick Pringle,\nChetan Sharma, Roger Harper and Peter Sleep was nothing to sneeze\nat. The century was reached from  balls, including  fours, and\nwas the perfect end to a perfect summer ofbatting.\nTendulkar finished with the highest aggregate for the touring side,\nHail the Boy King\n\n\n\n\fwith  runs from  matches ( innings) at the impressive average\nof. This included two centuries and six s. There was also a century\nin the one-day game against Derbyshire. As in the Test series, only\nAzhar and Shastri finished ahead ofSachin in the tour averages.\nThe tour of England was a huge step forward in the cricket\neducation ofTendulkar. Now he had other worlds to conquer.\n\n\n\nSachin On Top Down Under\n\nThis boy is from heaven. He will do anything.- Tim Laine\nThe hastily arranged South African tour gave the Indians precious\nlittle time to acclimatize and prepare for their Test tour to Australia.\nThe Indian team flew out straight after losing the third and final om\nin New Delhi on  November . The South Africans won the\ngame, but the series ended - in the home team's favour.\nIndia were slated to play five Tests Down Under for the first time\nsince -. In between the Test series, West Indies would join\nIndia and Australia for the wsc one-day tournament. And after that\nwas the big one-the World Cup. It would be the most gruelling tour\never undertaken by an Indian cricket team.\nJust how unprepared the Indians were to take on the might of\nAustralia was cruelly exposed in the first Test at Brisbane. This, after\nthey had been shot out for  in a one-day game against Western\nAustralia and beaten by New South Wales inside of three days in the\nonly first-class match before the Test series. The formidable Aussie\nfast bowling attack of Craig McDermott, Mike Whitney and Merv\nHughes blew away the Indians in the space of three and a half days by\nthe thumping margin of ten wickets. Still, there were two inspiring\nindividual achievements on the Indian side. On the third day, Kapil\nDev produced what Australian opening batsman David Boon described\nas 'the best three balls bowled consecutively that I have seen in Test\ncricket'. Boon was at the non-striker's end as Kapil bowled an inswinger to Allan Border of such perfect length that any left-hander\nwould have been bowled off-stump. The second ball, an outswinger\n\n\fto Dean Jones, beat bat and stump by a coat of varnish. The next ball\nwas brought back and bowled Jones for a duck. There were also some\nbatting heroics from Manoj Prabhakar who stayed at the crease for\nover five hours. The Test marked the debut ofJavagal Srinath who\npicked up three wickets.\nThe traditional Boxing Day Test at Melbourne followed much the\nsame pattern, the margin of victory for Australia this time being eight\nwickets. The destroyer-in-chiefwas Bruce Reid who replaced another\nleft-arm seamer, Whitney, in the attack. Reid had figures of for \nand once again the Test was over in four days. Tendulkar had been a\ndisappointment so far, as was the Indian batting as a whole. His first\nthree innings had produced scores of,  and . But in the second\ninnings at Melbourne, he hit a cultured  with five fours before a\nrush of blood saw him caught in the deep off spinner Peter Taylor.\nBorder took a brilliant catch, running back over a hundred feet to\nclutch the swirling ball. It was a chastening experience for the young\nman, who vowed never again to hit the ball in the air.\nThe Sydney wicket with its reputation for aiding spinners has\nalways provided welcome respite from the generally bouncy tracks\nfound across Australia, for touring Indian teams. It was surprising\nthen that India went in for the third Test with only one spinner (Ravi\nShastri), with Venkatapathy Raju and Narendra Hirwani having to\ncool their heels. Shastri emerged as the Man of the Match for the first\ndouble century by an Indian against Australia and four wickets in the\nsecond innings, which almost saw India pull off a shock victory. But it\nwas Tendulkar's sublime century that had the critics once again eating\nout of the palm ofhis hand. David Boon's  not out was the standout\ninnings in Australia's total of .\nIndia lost Navjot Singh Sidhu for a duck. But they had a stroke of\nluck when their tormentor in the previous Test, Bruce Reid, limped\noff with a torn muscle in the side after bowling just four overs, and\ntook no further part in the Test. That was just the chance the Indian\nbatting needed to finally come good after the defeats at Brisbane and\nMelbourne. Opener Shastri batted nearly ten hours for his  before\nbecoming the only victim ofleg-spinner Shane Warne who finished\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fwith  for  on his Test debut. Even as Shastri dropped anchor and\nsought to repair the early damage with a little help from Manjrekar\nand Vengsarkar, it was the silken skills of Tendulkar that had all of\nAustralia suddenly taking notice of the Indian team. The record stand\nfor the fifth wicket between Shastri and Tendulkar was worth  in\n minutes and as Shastri moved towards his first Test double century,\nTendulkar took centre stage with an array of dazzling shots that had\nthe spectators riveted. The fourth day's play belonged to Tendulkar as\nhe reached his century in  minutes from  balls, the youngest to\ndo so on Australian soil. Once again, as at Old Trafford in , the\nbat was lifted, the helmet taken off, and a shy half-smile crossed his\nlips.\nAt  years and  days, Sachin had surpassed the previous record\nheld by Australian left-handed legend Neil Harvey who had made\n against India at Melbourne in , at the age of years and \ndays,  years before Tendulkar was born. Harvey himself led the\nchorus which rang out across the country. He thought Sachin's\nperformance had been quite brilliant and expressed his belief that he\nwould be around for a long time and would break a few records before\nhe was finished.\n'He is the best player I have seen for ages. I love the way he places\nthe ball past fieldsmen and his back-foot technique is superb. He also\nseems to have a good temperament. Given his ability and the number\nof Test matches they play these days, he could play  Tests before\nhe's finished:\nThere was something else Sachin had in common with Harvey.\nHe forced a fielding captain to accept an offer ofbad light, something\nHarvey had achieved in South Mrica. With just a handful of Tests\nbehind him, Sachin's innings displayed a maturity that put the vastly\nexperienced batsmen who came before and after him to shame.\nVirtually everything came off the middle of the bat and he drove and\ncut with panache and precision.\nThe Aussies, meanwhile, had been giving a hard time to both\nShastri and Tendulkar with their patented form of abuse known\neuphemistically in Australia as 'sledging'. 'I had just reached my\nOn Top Down Under\n\n\n\n\fhundred and I was having a verbal duel with the Australians,' recalled\nShastri in MidDay (May). ~t the end of the over he came over to\nme and said in Marathi, \"Thumb, mazha pan shambhar hounde\" (Wait\ntill I get my hundred). And I said, with your brilliance young man,\nyou don't even have to do that. What happened is history. The Waugh\nbrothers were made to eat humble pie.'\nIndia declined to declare on their overnight  for  (Tendulkar:\n not out) on the final day and added a further  runs to swell their\nlead to . Tendulkar was now improvising and got  of the last \nruns. His  not out from  balls with  fours took a shade under\nfive hours. Needing  to avoid an innings defeat, Australia finished\non a precarious  for  with captain Border hanging on for . With\nthe wicket taking plenty of spin on the final day, Azhar in desperation\nturned to Tendulkar to bowl some off spin. And he claimed his first\nTest wicket in his only over when he had the obdurate Merv Hughes\ncaught by Prabhakar for . The draw was a huge turnaround from\nthe crushing defeats India had suffered in the previous two Tests and\nprevented the clean sweep which many Aussie supporters had been\npredicting. Victory could have been India's but for some strange tactics\nand also time lost to rain. Azhar was criticized for delaying the\ndeclaration till early on the fifth day. In hindsight, the  minutes he\nbatted on and the ten minutes for the change of innings may have\nproved the difference between victory for the Indians and a draw.\nDavid Frith summed up the match eloquently in Wisden Cricket\nMonthly (February ): 'Tendulkar's creamy elegance, power and\nprecocity had even the local partisans cooing ... It was bad luck for\nShastri that his double-century and his wickets will take second place\nin public memory behind Tendulkar's beautiful century. The boy\nwonder's talent is so great it's almost frightening.'\nBetween Test matches, India, Australia and the West Indies were\ninvolved in the World Series Cup (wsc) in which India had lost in the\nfinals in -. The tournament marked the start of the decline of\nthe mighty West Indies, World Cup champions in  and  and\nvirtually invincible in one-day games in Australia until now. Led by\nRichie Richardson, West Indies were without the one and only Vivian\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fRichards for the first time since the mid-s. Veterans like Desmond\nHaynes and Malcolm Marshall were coming to the end of their careers,\nand Brian Lara was yet to set the cricket world alight. Indeed, it was\nIndia who had first pricked the bubble of Caribbean invincibility, first\nat Berbice in  and then later the same year at Lord's in the World\nCup finals.\nThe tri-series began in sensational style at Perth on  December\n with Sachin Tendulkar getting the last West Indies wicket to\nearn a tie for India. Ttwas the first time in  oms that both sides were\nall out for exactly t; .. ame score-a perfect tie. In conditions ideal for\nswing and seam bowlers, both sides made their lowest total against\neach other. Shastri took a laborious  balls to score , the highest\nscore in the match. There were just two boundaries in the entire Indian\ninnings of  all out in . overs and Shastri hit both. West Indies\nwere quickly in trouble too, as debutant medium-pacer Subroto\nBanerjee picked up three wickets, including Lara for . The score\nwas  for  before the unlikely pair of Curtly Ambrose and Anderson\nCummins came together in the biggest stand of the match ().\nCummins and last man Patrick Patterson had pieced together  runs\nwhen Tendulkar had Cummins brilliantly caught in the slips by a\ndiving Azhar, with the scores level. It was his only over of the match\nand made up to some extent for his failure with the bat.\nTwo days later, it was Australia's turn to collapse for their lowest\nscore against India, a measly , as India scored a thumping win by\n runs against the reigning world champions. Shastri's - from\n. overs were the best om figures tor India till -. Tendulkar\ngave away just eight runs from his four overs and also scored a useful\n in India's score of for . Mter the shock at Perth, Australia came\nback strongly to crush India by eight wickets at Hobart and then edge\nWest Indies out by nine runs at Melbourne. Manjrekar and Tendulkar\nhit identical scores () and their stand of  stood out starkly in a\npaltry Indian total of  for  at Hobart.\nWest Indies' poor run continued as they were beaten by ten runs\nby India at Adelaide. The Indian total of for  would be the highest\nin a tournament in which the ball generally dominated the bat.\nOn Top Down Under\n\n\n\n\fSrikkanth-who was making a comeback after being\nunceremoniously dumped following the Palcistan tour-smashed \nat almost a run a ball with Manjrekar () and Tendulkar () helping\nto boost the score. Australia by now were on a roll, and they flattened\nboth their opponents. It would be a fight between India and West\nIndies for the other slot in the final. West Indies finally broke their\nwretched run as Cummins' - bowled them to victory by six wicket<>\nagainst India at Brisbane. Tendulkar's  was his highest score in \noms and he was now emerging as the most reliable of the Indian\nbatsmen. Each time he looked set to get a bigger score, though, he got\nout to impetuous shots. With the West Indies beating Australia and\nthen India losing to Australia, it came down to the last game. The\nwinner of the final league game at Melbourne would be in the final.\nWest Indies crawled to  for  from  overs and three run-outs\nensured that they could only reach  for . Though he did not\nclaim any wickets, Tendulkar gave away just  runs in his full quota\nof ten overs. The Indian batting was pinned down by an outstanding\nopening spell by Ambrose: ---. But Man of the Match Tendulkar\nhelped break the shackles with  not out, which saw India home by\nfive wickets and into the finals.\nAustralia romped home by eight wickets in the first final at\nMelbourne. The second at Sydney could have gone either way. India\nneeded  off the last over bowled by Whitney. They lost by six runs.\nTendulkar once again top-scored with  from  balls, though he\nhad some lucky escapes. He was dropped by Steve Waugh, who had\nearlier 'caught' him off a no-ball. Waugh floored a skier off his own\nbowling even as TV commentator Tony Greig was saying, 'No way in\nthe world will he drop that.' Then Tom Moody's throw from square\nleg hit the stumps and the TV replay showed Tendulkar was short of\nhis ground. This was before the advent of the third umpire with the\nbenefit of TV replays. Ironically, just ten months later Tendulkar would\nbecome the first to be given out (run out) to this technology.\nWith  runs from ten innings (one not out) Sachin was the\nleading Indian batsman. The wsc one-day games were an ideal warmup to the World Cup, though they did add to the fatigue of the players.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fBut for now it was back to the Test series with India down - after\nthree Tests. Shastri had suffered a knee injury during the wsc and his\nabsence from the last two Tests of the series was a major setback for the\nteam. The Indian bowling had come in for much flak at the start of the\ntour. But the bowlers had performed creditably, and it was their batting\nthat was the bane of the Indians. The bowlers had their finest hour in\nAustralia's first innings in the fourth Test at Adelaide after Azhar had\nwon the toss and put them in. Memories of a similar decision \nmonths ago may have been on his mind. But this time, it paid off\nhandsomely. Kapil Dev and Raju picked up three wickets apiece. And\nTendulkar broke the back of the batting with two vital wickets at the\nstart of the innings. He bowled opener Mark Taylor for , and then\nhad Border caught by Pandit for his second duck of the series. Australia\ncrashed to  all out.\nKapil was having a vintage series with both bat and ball, and his \nwas the first half-century of the match. But with the top six batsmen\nswept away by Hughes and McDermott with just  on the board, it\nlooked like Australia would take the lead after all. However, this time\nthe Indian tail wagged and a lead of runs was their reward.\nThe Australian umpiring sunk to new depths during the series\nand was a persistent grouse with the tourists. When Boon was on ,\nKapil rapped him on the pads, but he was given not out. It seemed an\nunjust decision at the time to the Indians and they would certainly\nhave cause to rue it, for Boon () and Taylor () added  for the\nsecond wicket, helping Australia cross the  mark for the first time\nin the series.\nIndeed, eight Indian batsmen would be given out leg before in this\nTest, against two for the Australians. But it was the shocker which\nVengsarkar received in the second innings, stretching well forward to\nHughes, that took the cake and led commentator Ian Chappell to\nblurt out on air, 'If that was not outside the line of the off stump when\nit hit, then I'm a Dutchman.' This from a true-blue Aussie!\nThe normally diplomatic Indian cricket manager Abbas Ali Baig\nasked cuttingly if there had been any changes in Law  which his\nteam were unaware of, and about which he wished to speak to the\nOn Top Down Under\n\n\n\n\fumpires for the fifth Test.\nAzhar's form in the series had also become the topic of discussion\namongst the team and back home. He had eked out just  runs so far\nand there were murmurings that he was not worth his place in the\nside. It hardly helped matters that the side contained four former\ncaptains-Shastri, Kapil, Vengsarkar and Srikkanth-perhaps still\nnursing a desire to get back the captaincy.\nIn his authorized biography of Azharuddin, Harsha Bhogle hinted\nat this while stressing that the younger members of the team were\nbehind their skipper. 'Sachin Tendulkar told me, \"If only Azzu could\nscore runs, it would make such a difference. For his sake, we all want\nhim to get runs. You know, the other day, I just couldn't control myself\nand I went and told him that if he batted like this, it might help.\nPerhaps I shouldn't have done it but all of us so badly want him to\nscore\"' (Azhar: The Authorized Biography cif Mohammad Azharuddin ).\nThe final day, and the equation was clear. India had all their wickets\nintact and the target was now  from  overs. Azhar had dropped\nhimself down to number six to accommodate Tendulkar at four, since\nthe team had decided to go all out for victory in the hope of keeping\nthe series alive. It was make or break for both the team and their leader,\nand Azhar responded with the most dazzling batting exhibition so far.\nJust as he had done in England and New Zealand in , he went tor\nthe bowling and tore it apart. Prabhakar ( ) put on  with him for\nthe seventh wicket in less than  minutes, and while they were at the\ncrease an improbable Indian victory suddenly loomed large. Azhar\nsmashed  between lunch and tea, at which point the score was \nfor , with  more needed. It took a tremendous burst with the\nsecond new ball by McDermott and another diabolical umpiring\ndecision to thwart the victory charge. Azhar was snapped up at slip by\nMark Taylor for  as McDermott took the final four wickets to fall,\nincluding Prabhakar lbw off an inside edge. With five wickets in both\ninnings, the Man of the Match award was his. The series could so\neasily have been - going into the final Test at Perth. Instead, Australia\nhad pocketed it - and the Indians were to rue several missed\nopportunities, not to mention the umpiring that did them in at crucial\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fmoments.\nDespite there being little to play for at Perth, the Test produced\nsome glorious personal milestones and achievements. The resultAustralia's victory by a whopping  runs-seemed almost\ninconsequential. Three Australian batsmen-David Boon, Dean Jones\nand Tom Moody-reached three figures (it was Boon's third century\nof the series) and Mike Whitney took the bowling honours (- and\n-). But it was Tendulkar and Kapil who had the media and the fans\nenthralled. When Kapil had Taylor lbw for  on the fourth day, he\nbecame only the second bowler after New Zealand's Sir Richard\nHadlee to reach the milestone of  Test wickets. With four wickets\nin the Test, the medium-pacer who had made his debut in  had\nhis best overseas series with  victims in all. Only McDermott with\n topped that.\nThe fourth day also saw Tendulkar progress from his overnight \nnot out to his second century of the series, and already predictions\nwere being made by journalists and former cricketers about the\nglittering career that lay ahead of him. After Australia's , it took\nTendulkar's daring strokes to get his side to within  runs in the first\ninnings. A total of -plus in the fourth innings was always beyond\nIndia's batsmen. But their capitulation to a mere  all out after an\nopening stand of stunned one and all.\nTendulkar's century came from only  balls, with  fours, as he\ncut the formidable Australian pace attack to size in a breathtaking\ndisplay of aggression. The second  of the innings came from \nballs with six boundaries. He was like the boy who stood on the burning\ndeck, for every other batsman in the side struggled to cope with the\nsteep ling bounce. There would be two more boundaries before he was\ncaught knee-high by Moody at second slip offWhitney. He had scored\n out of the  runs made while at the crease. The innings was\nmarked by cutting and driving of ferocious power and timing. Often\nhe would go up on his toes to smash the ball to the distant square\nboundaries. The series saw some dazzling batsmanship on both sides.\nBut they all paled iii comparison to Tendulkar's third century in \nTests.\n\n\fThe Tendulkar fan club was now growing rapidly. Former\nAustralian Test batsman Norman O'Neill had this to say: 'The\ndifference between an ordinary and a class player is the time he has\neven to make last second adjustments to play his strokes. Tendulkar\nhas it. He is all class. I enjoyed every moment of his innings.' Said\nBorder, 'If he could play like this at , I shudder to think what he will\nbe at .' In fact, he was still a couple of months shy of his nineteenth\nbirthday at the end of the Perth Test. Even ABC radio commentator\nTim Laine's gushing praise did not seem out of place: 'This boy is\nfrom heaven. He will do anything' (Sportstar,  February ). Nearly\na decade later, even after his twenty-fifth Test century, Tendulkar\nhimself rated this knock as among his top three (Cricket Talk, \nDecember ).\nDavid Boon told me, 'It was quite amazing that someone so young\ncould show the maturity he did. His shot selection and execution\nwere of someone who would normally be much older and more\nexperienced.'\nCricket manager Abbas Ali Baig shared his memories of the tour\nand ofTendulkar in particular with me in his office in New Delhi in\nOctober . 'At Sydney he had a senior pro (Shastri) with him to\nnurse him along-not that he really needed it at that stage of his\ncareer. The wicket at Sydney was also rather slow. At Perth it was\nanother matter. It was a very nasty and fast wicket and the Australian\nfast bowlers were playing havoc with our batsmen. But Sachin was\nhooking them with impunity; he was cutting and driving them. I rate\nthis innings very, very highly. The Australians secretly adored him\nbut on the field they gave him a bit of stick as is their wont. They\nalways pick out the best player and target him. But he never flinched\nand gave it back to them.\n'At team meetings he would be very involved. He would sit quietly\nbut then his little voice would suddenly pipe up. He would be to the\npoint and didn't waste your time. Even at that age you had to take note\nof his suggestions. He was remarkably mature for his age.'\n\n\n\nSachin\n Home, Sweet Home\n\nIt is impossible to fathom what the youngster is capable c!f-R. Mohan\nIt was exactly  months after he made his international debut that\nSachin Tendulkar finally played a Test match on home soil.\nThat  month-period saw the Indian team play an amazing ten\nTest matches, as well as One-day Internationals in Pakistan, New\nZealand, England and Sharjah. Mter all that hectic activity, the Indians\nwould play just one Test in the next  months. Indian fans longing to\nget a glimpse of the teenager who had wowed audiences around the\nworld finally got their opportunity with the one-off Test against Sri\nLanka at Chandigarh in November .\nSri Lanka were still the pushovers of international cricket, a far cry\nfrom their post- status. The prosaic sounding Sector  Stadium\nin Chandigarh was hosting its first Test match, which would also be\nits last. (From  international cricket in the city moved to the\nsuburb ofMohali on the outskirts ofChandigarh. Expansion at Sector\n was ruled out due to local building laws and the Punjab Cricket\nAssociation now has one of the best stadia in the country.) The match\nhad been shifted from Jalandhar at short notice due to political unrest\nthere. For the first time in India security was so tight that the police\noutnumbered the spectators on a couple of days. Both teams were\nguarded day and night at the stadium and their hotel by \npolicemen. It was a pointer of things to come.\nThe under-prepared pitch was the talking point of the Test that\nIndia won by an innings with a day to spare. Azhar won the toss and\nbatted first. Ravi Shastri's  was the lone half-century of the match\n\n\feven as India struggled to reach . But that score was more than\nenough as the visitors crumbled to  and  all out.\nThe Man of the Match was left-arm spinner Venkatapathy Raju.\nIn only his third Test he had figures of  for  and  for  from .\novers. It was Azhar's first win as captain and the first for the Indian\nteam after playing  Tests abroad.\nSachin managed only . But it was a heady experience being on\nthe winning side for the first time since his debut a year before. The\nIndian dressing room was a joyous sight with champagne corks\npopping, though the captain and the prodigy were among those\nabstaining from the bubbly.\nSri Lanka's plea for an extra Test match was turned down by the\nBCCI, citing short notice. With Pakistan subsequently cancelling their\nvisit to India on security grounds, this remained the lone Test of the\n- season.\nIndia took the three-match om series against Sri Lanka that followed\nthe one-off Test with a - margin. For the first time, Tendulkar\nshowed glimpses ofhis prowess with the ball.\nIndia won the first  at Nagpur by  runs with Tendulkar\ncontributing . The second at Pune on  December saw him pick up\nhis first wickets in international cricket, those of openers Roshan\nMahanama and Dhammika Ranatunge, returning figures of-- with his gentle medium-pacers. To add to his wickets, Tendulkar\nrecorded his first ODI () which saw India win comfortably by six\nwickets. He reached his half-century in just  balls and hit seven\nfours and a six in a sparkling innings. His stand with Azhar for the\nthird wicket was worth  runs in only . overs. The all-round\nperformance-which included two catches and the run-out of skipper\nArjuna Ranatunga-earned Sachin the first of his numerous Man of\nthe Match awards. It was one of those games in which everything he\ntouched seemed to turn to gold.\nThe final game at Margao was played on an under-prepared pitch\nand halfway through the innings, Azhar and Tendulkar had to call for\nhelmets to play the Sri Lankan spinners as the ball turned and jumped\nalarmingly. Tendulkar's  was the top score in a miserable Indian\n\n\nSachin\n\n\ftotal of  all out. The visitors romped home by seven wickets after\nthe pitch had dried out.\nThere was success at home for the Indians in the Asia Cup which\nfollowed. But with Pakistan pulling out, the tournament was robbed\nof its glamour and India fought it out with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\nTendulkar had a quiet tournament, though he equalled his highest\nscore of  in the final at Kolkata, in which India beat Sri Lanka by\nseven wickets.\nThe lack of international cricket for the rest of the season was a\nblessing in disguise for Indian cricket. Finally, the big names in the\ncountry like Kapil Dcv, Ravi Shastri, Dilip Vengsarkar, Sachin\nTendulkar and others would be available to assist their state and zonal\nteams in the domestic tournaments. The result was some gripping\ncricket after a gap of many years. Sachin enjoyed being a member of\ntheM urnbai team that won the Wills Trophy and the West Zone team\nthat lifted the Deodhar Trophy, both limited-overs tournaments. Both\nthese tournaments were a novel experience for him, as was the zonal\nfirst-class Duleep Trophy in which West Zone lost in the final to\nNorth Zone under highly contentious circumstances.\nThe quarter-finals against East Zone at Guwahati from  to \nJanuary  saw Sachin complete a unique treble. With an innings\nof  in the first innings he entered the record books as the first and\nstill the only batsman to score a century on debut in the Ranji, Irani\nand Duleep Trophy. The first two feats had been achieved before the\nstart ofhis international career. Now, after a year in world cricket, he\nhad made it three out of three in domestic cricket's first-class set-up.\nThe East Zone bowling attack was certainly no great shakes and\nhad no big names to speak of Their batting was marked by Sourav\nGanguly's maiden century in his seventh first-class match. Uniquely,\nthere were two future India captains in this match, Ganguly and\nTendulkar, as well as two from the recent past-Ravi Shastri and Dilip\nVengsarkar.\nThe West Zone batting, on the other hand, was formidable, with\nthe first six batsmen in the line-up as well as number eight Kiran\nMore having international experience. Little surprise then, that on a\nHome, Sweet Home\n\n\n\n\fplacid track there should be massive scores. Lalchand Rajput (),\nSanjay Manjrekar () and Vengsarkar () all cashed in while\nTendulkar top-scored with . East were no match for the West total\nof  and were all out for . The match was drawn with West\nadvancing on their huge first innings lead. Tendulkar's innings, his\nfifth century in  first-class matches, was divided in pace. It took him\n minutes to reach three figures, but he lashed out after that. The\nlast  runs included nine fours and two sixes and came from a mere\n balls.\nThe semi-finals between West Zone and South Zone at Rourkela\nproduced a typical run-feast. South piled up . But that was dwarfed\nby West's  and once again West advanced on the basis of their first\ninnings lead. This time the bowling attack was certainly more\nchallenging than in the previous match. South had in their ranks\nJavagal Srinath, Venkatapathy Raju, Arshad Ayub, Robin Singh and\nAni) Kumble. Not that it bothered Tendulkar. His contribution this\ntime was another century: .\nThe stage was set for the battle of the giants of domestic cricket,\nNorth Zone and West Zone, atJamshedpur. It was a match that was\ndestined to go down in history, but for all the wrong reasons.\nNorth Zone, led by Kapil Dev, were more than a match for West in\nbatting and bowling. Their total of was beyond the reach of even\nthe formidable West batting line-up which could muster 'only' \nagainst a bowling attack that was virtually that of the Indian team\nitself\nTendulkar failed this time, and that may have made all the\ndifference. Both sides had three century-makers. But Tendulkar's\ncontribution was just  and with his dismissal, West's hopes faded.\nThe North second innings was a formality. But it ended in an ugly\nbrawl between bowler Rashid Patel from Gujarat and batsman Raman\nLamba from Delhi. There had been plenty of bad blood spilled in the\nmatch already, with the North bowlers resorting to beamers and\ndeliberate overstepping, and the air thick with foul language. Patel\ndecided to give the North batsmen a taste of their own medicine in the\nshort time left for them to bat out the match, and bowled some\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fmenacing bouncers and beamers. Hot words were exchanged between\nbatsman and bowler and for the first time, cricket witnessed a bowler\nassaulting a batsman with a stump on the field of play. Both Lamba\nand Patel received bans of varying degrees from the BCCI for their\nbehaviour even as the match was abandoned by the umpires.\nIn one of those strange twists offate, the Delhi opener, one of the\nmost prolific batsmen in domestic cricket, died eight years later, in\n, after being struck on the head while fielding in a club match in\nDhaka.\nIndian cricket spent almost as much time in the law courts as out\non the field of play in this particular season, with controversies galore.\nThere was a two-month gap between the first two and last two quarterfinals as a dispute between Karnataka and Bengal dragged on and on.\nEven during the league stage, a legal dispute between Punjab and\nDelhi in the North Zone had threatened to disrupt the tournament.\nThe end result of all this acrimony was that the tournament for the\nfirst time dragged on till May.\nTendulkar had missed the West Zone league stage in the Ranji\nTrophy. But with Mumbai qualifYing as the second team in the league\nafter Maharashtra, he returned to assist them in the knockout stage.\nMter beating Uttar Pradesh by ten wickets in the pre-quarter-finals,\nMumbai faced the might ofDelhi in the quarter-final tie at the Feroze\nShah Kotla. The match was played in the middle of April.\nA number of Delhi players had been contracted to play league\ncricket in England that summer. Conflicting interests led to a fixed\nmatch, as the Delhi players admitted to the Central Bureau of\nInvestigation (CBI) a decade later, during its investigations into matchfixing and corruption in cricket. At the time, of course, no one suspected\nanything, and the Mumbai-Delhi match was widely thought to be\none of the most exciting Ranji Trophy matches of all time. Tendulkar\ntop-scored with  in Mumbai's total of. Bantoo Singh's century\nfor Delhi guided them to  for . But when Wassan was bowled by\nPatil for , Mumbai were assured of a place in the semi-finals on the\nbasis of their first innings lead of one run. And the Delhi cricketers\ncould happily book their tickets to England. Failure to arrive on time\nHome, Sweet Home\n\n\n\n\fwould have invited hefty fines from their clubs.\nMumbai made a mountain of runs in their second innings: \nfor  declared. Tendulkar's  was his third century in five first-class\nmatches. Though Delhi's second innings was a formality, there was\nenough time for Tendulkar to make his mark again, this time with the\nball.\nHe had bowled just one over in the first innings. Now, in the\nsecond, he got one to leap from the placid pitch and hit Bantoo Singh,\nfracturing the nose of the first-innings century-maker. Tendulkar had\nfancied himself as a fast bowler till Dennis Lillee told him to\nconcentrate on his batting. But it is doubtful whether even the great\nAustralian would have been able to extract such life out of a dead Kotla\npitch on the final day.\nEven by the batting standards oflndian domestic cricket, Mumbai's\n for  declared in the semi-finals against Hyderabad at the\nWankhede Stadium four days later was an awesome figure. Sanjay\nManjrekar's  was the highest ever by a Mumbai batsman in the\nRanji Trophy. There were centuries from Vengsarkar and Kambli as\nwell, while Tendulkar's contribution was  and  in Mumbai's\nsecond innings of  for  declared. Hyderabad stood no chance at\nall.\nFor the first time Sachin would experience the thrill of playing in\nthe final of the National Championship, that too at home at the\nWankhede Stadium. Mumbai's opponents were Haryana, who under\nKapil Dev had made short work of Bengal in the other semi-final.\nKapil, Chetan Sharma and Ajay Jadeja (yet to make a mark in\ninternational cricket) were the only known names in the Haryana\nline-up. Mumbai, on the other hand, was a virtual who's who oflndian\ncricket and the red-hot favourites. It turned out to be one of the best\nRanji finals of all time. Haryana's huge  was built around opener\nDeepak Sharma's  while both Jadeja and Chetan Sharma fell in\nthe s. Most of the top Mumbai players made useful runs, Tendulkar\ncontributing  before he was lbw to Chetan Sharma. It was\nnightwatchman Sanjay Patil who top-scored with . However,\nMumbai's  was well short of Haryana's total and it looked like\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fcurtains for the side. But their bowlers turned in a strong secondinnings performance and had Haryana on the ropes at  for  before\nAjay Banerjee ( not out) rallied them to . The target was  for\nMumbai to win back the Ra~i Trophy they had last claimed in . The run rate was stiff, more than five an over.\nAt  down for , Tendulkar and Vengsarkar gor together in a\nrollicking stand worth  runs. Sachin took the bowling attack\nspearheaded by Kapil Dev and Chetan Sharma apart. He reached his\n from just  balls, taking over the attacking role from his captain\nand senior partner. The Haryana bowling was dispatched all around\nas Tendulkar raced towards a century which appeared inevitable till\nhe was caught by Jadeja off the bowling of off-spinner Yogendra\nBhandari for . Sachin was going for the boundary that would have\ngot him his ton. The last  runs had come from just  balls and the\nsparkling innings was studded with five sixes and nine fours. A crowd\nof  had turned up to watch the final day's play-a large number\nfor a domestic match in India. They had pinned their hopes on the\nyoung hero ofMumbai. Such was his dazzling stroke play on the last\nday that even Kapil Dev was seen shaking his head in bewilderment.\nJust two and a half years earlier, the schoolboy Sachin had faced the\nchampion bowler in the nets at the Wankhede Stadium. Now he was\ndictating terms to him.\nSachin's dismissal at  for , followed by that ofVinod Kambli\n(), triggered another collapse even as Vengsarkar marched towards\na majestic century. When the ninth wicket fell, debutant pace bowler\nAbey Kuruvilla joined the captain with  runs still needed for victory.\nAs tension mounted, the pair added  before the last man was run\nout. Victory was Haryana's by two runs. Though Vengsarkar's \nnot out was the top score for Mumbai, the run chase would have been\ngiven up as futile if it hadn't been for the teenager's batting\npyrotechnics.\nTendulkar would have to wait some more time to be part of a Ranji\nTrophy winning side. He ended the season with  runs from four\nmatches at the outstanding average of .. There were also two\nindividual honours for him. He was named as the Association of\nHome, Sweet Home\n\n\n\n\fCricket Statisticians and Scorers oflndia (ACSSI) Cricketer of the Year\nand one of the five Cricketers of the Year by Indian CricketAnnual.\nThe cancellation ofPakistan's visit to India meant there would be no\ninternational cricket till October  when India were scheduled to\nbe back in Sharjah for the three-nation Wills Trophy. There would be\nnon-stop action for the next six months, culminating in the \nWorld Cup in Australia.\nThe opening match for India in the Sharjah three-nation Wills\nTrophy against Pakistan on  October  saw the side record a rare\nwin over their arch-rivals. Manjrekar was the top scorer with . But\nit was Tendulkar's  not out from  balls, with five fours, that\nprovided the impetus towards the end of the innings. The match also\nmarked the international debut of Vi nod Kambli, three and a half\nyears after he had been involved in the world-record partnership with\nhis school chum for Sharadashram Vidyamandir.\nIn the final league match, which India lost to Pakistan under dark\nskies and in controversial circumstances, Tendulkar fell one short of\nanother . But he failed in the final, lbw first ball to Aaqib Javed. That\ncompleted a hat-trick for the medium-pacer who had tlgures of for\n, a world record in One-day Internationals that would last for ten\nyears. West Indies were beaten by India in both their league games. In\nthe second of these, Sachin got the Man of the Match award, but not\nfor his batting. He returned his best bowling figures of  for  as the\nformer world champions crun bled to  all out. Tendulkar accounted\nfor opener Clayton Lambert, captain Richie Richardson, Gus Logie\nand JeffDujon. His success with .the ball meant he was now an integral\npart of the team's bowling plan.\nMeanwhile, in faraway South Mrica, dramatic events were rapidly\nunfolding that were soon to bury the evil of apartheid. India had been\nin the forefront of the movement to ban South Africa from\ninternational cricket in . Until then, South Mrica only played\nTest cricket against the 'white' nations of the ICC. Mter the ban, they\nfound themselves in exile for  years. With the release of Nelson\nMandela, the dismantling of apartheid and the advent of multiracial\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fsports, it was once again India that took the lead at the ICC meeting at\nLord's which saw South Mrica return to the fold. South Mrican cricket\nsupremo Dr Aaron 'Ali' Bacher showed his gratitude by agreeing to\ntour India. He hurriedly assembled a team under the captaincy of\nveteran Clive Rice and flew to India to play three ODis at the request of\nBCCI secretary Jagmohan Dalmiya.\nThe first match at Eden Gardens, Kolkata on  November \nin front of over , spectators was truly a historic event, going\nbeyond mere sporting cliches. All but Kepler Wessds, who had\npreviously represented his adopted country of Australia, were making\ntheir international debut. On the ground, the emotion was palpable\nand the enormous crowd, the likes of which the visitors had never\nseen, egged the home side to victory.\nThough the South Mrican total of  for  in  overs was hardly\nthreatening, India made heavy weather of it initially. South Mrica's\nspearhead Allan Donald blasted out the top order to capture the\nimpressive figures of for  as India lost their first four wickets with\njust  on the board. At this stage, a dream victory for the debutants\nwas very much on the cards. The damage for India was repaired by the\nMumbai pair ofTendulkar and debutant Praveen Amrein a rollicking\nstand worth  runs that snatched the initiative from the visitors.\n(Amre was the third of coach RamakantAchrekar's students to make\nit to the big league, following the examples ofTendulkar and Vinod\nKambli. His  at Kolkata would be followed a year later by a century\non Test debut against the same opponents at Durban. It was a feat that\nAchrekar's other two prodigies had been incapable of.)\nR.Mohan was effusive in his praise ofTendulkar's many talents\n(he also picked up the wicket of South Mrica's top scorer Wessels) in\nthe Sportstar ( November ): 'It is impossible to fathom what the\nyoungster is capable of. He is a match winner pure and simple. The\nmanner in which he adapted to the slow wicket and played the shots\nfew others could strike with any great conviction is a clear pointer that\nhe is the jewel in the Indian crown. Soon, very soon, people will be\nturning up only to watch Tendulkar play. He has so much of the\nchampion phenomenon in him. And he is not capable of playing for\nHome, Sweet Home\n\n\n\n\frecords because he has such a positive approach. Ifhe continues to bat\nlike this he will be the leader of the new era in which the raw power of\nbatting is going to dominate cricket as it has baseball. Only Tendulkar\nwould use that dominance in that refreshingly orthodox way of his.'\nThe Man of the Match award was shared by Donald and Tendulkar,\nan unusual occurrence in international cricket, but one in keeping\nwith the spirit of the occasion.\n\n\n\nSachin World Cup Debut\n\nInzamam is a much better batsman against fast bowling.-Imran Khan\nThere was some speculation at the end of the Test series that the Indian\nteam would return for a short break before their opening World Cup\ngame at Perth against England on  February, just  days after the\nfifth Test at the same venue had ended. Many of the players were\nhomesick after so many weeks away from their families, and the\nprospect of another month of travelling the length and breadth of this\nvast land for the World Cup was a daunting one. However, it was\ndecided that they should stay on and play a couple of warm-up games,\nthough the team was hardly short of match practice. Ajay Jadeja and\nVinod Kambli joined the team for the World Cup and Ravi Shastri\nwas back from Mumbai, having been declared fit after the knee injury\nthat had kept him out of the last two Test matches.\nThe (ifth edition of the World Cup to be staged in Australia and\nNew Zealand, or the Benson and Hedges World Cup to give it its full\nname, was unique in many respects. For the first time on the world\nstage, matches would be played under lights with the players donning\ncoloured outfits and using two white balls from either ends. This\nwould set the trend for future World Cups. There was also considerable\nexcitement over the debut of post-apartheid South Mrica. Also, there\nwas a new round-robin league format, with all the nine teams facing\neach other.\nThe tournament could not have got off to a more sensational start.\nNew Zealand, which had failed to make the semi-finals in ,\nstunned World Cup holders Australia by  runs in Auckland, with\n\n\fKiwi skipper Martin Crowe stroking a masterly  not out-and\nsurprising one and all by opening the bowling with off-spinner Dipak\nPatel. On the same day at the Western Association Cricket Association\n(wAcA), India came within a whisker of upsetting the  runnersup England, ultimately losing by just nine runs. This was a match\nthat swung back and forth as India became the first team to bat under\nlights in a World Cup game. With Graham Gooch () and Robin\nSmith () to the fore, England made a brisk start and were looking\ngood for a big score. Smith was out at  for  and the last six wickets\nthen crashed for just  runs. The English tally for the last seven overs\nwas  runs for the loss of six wickets and a total of for  appeared\neminently achievable. That certainly seemed the case as openers\nShastri and Srikkanth put on  in contrasting styles. There were\nseven boundaries in the latter's , while Shastri top-scored with a\nrather laborious . Azhar's nightmare run with the bat continued, as\nhe got out on the first ball. At  for , it was left to the Mumbai pair of\nShastri and Tendulkar to put the innings back on the rails. This they\ndid in a stand that doubled the score by the thirtieth over.\nNow Ian Botham swung the advantage back England's way with\nan inspired spell ofbowling that would win him the Man of the Match\naward. Just as Tendulkar was looking like he would win the game\nsingle-handed, Botham tied him down and then foxed him with a\nslower one. The perfectly pitched away cutter had him playing forward\nand well caught by wicketkeeper Alec Stewart for a smart  from \nbalb, with five fours. The experienced Botham was delighted; the\nyoung Tendulkar anguished. It was a dismissal he would forever look\nupon with considerable chagrin, for he did not have a clue to the\ndelivery. Botham also accounted for Vinod Kambli and the equation\ncame down to  from seven overs, then to  from three with the last\nwicket pair ofBanerjee and Srinath at the crease. Some amazing shots\nsaw them needing  from the last over from Chris Lewis. But\nEngland had the last laugh.\nIndia's next match against Sri Lanka at Mackay was abandoned\ndue to rain after just two balls had been bowled and both teams were\nawarded one point. Australia had suffered another shock defeat,\n\n\nSachin\n\n\ffollowing their loss to New Zealand m the opening game. This time\nthey were handed out a nine-wicket trouncing by South Mrica who\ncould not have marked their World Cup debut in greater style.\nThe India-Australia bout at Brisbane on  March was thm. a needle\nmatch with both teams looking for their first win. It turned out to be\none of the greatest games of cricket ever, at the venue of the first ever\ntied Test (in ).\nAustralia batted first. Dean Jones hit  from  balls, while\nBorder's miserable form with the bat continued, and they finished on\n for . Kapil Dev and Prabhakar turned in identical figures of-\nfrom ten overs. India, in its innings, had reached  for  (Srikkanth\nthe batsman out, bowled for a duck by McDermott) after . overs,\nwhen there was a -minute delay on account of rain. The rain rule\ncame into play then, and the revised target (under the 'highest scoring\novers' formula) was now  from  overs. While only two runs had\nbeen knocked off the target, India would have three overs less to play.\nThe damp ball after the rain made things slippery for the Aussie\nbowlers. Azharuddin played one ofhis gems, a rare occurrence in a\ntour of horrors for the Indian captain. Kapil Dev was promoted to\npush the scoring along and slammed  in a run-a-ball cameo. This\nafter Shastri had got bogged down, plodding to  from  balls.\nIt was Manjrekar, coming in at number six, who gave his captain\nthe necessary support to go for the win. Azhar played typically glorious,\nwristy shots all round the ground and raced to  from  balls (ten\nfours) before becoming the first offour run-out victims in the innings:\nBorder's rocket-like throw caught him short of the crease. His stand\nwith Manjrekar was worth , and when he fell the score was  for\n. With eight overs and six wickets in hand, the target had come down\nto . Manjrekar lifted the tempo and it was now down to  from five.\nHe hit Hughes for a six and a four and raced to  from  balls, then\nhe too was run out at  for , with  runs still needed for what\nseemed an improbable win. Tendulkar's failure (he was out for )\nput further pressure on the lower order.\nIt was now left to the tail-enders and they took the team to the very\ndoorstep of victory. A miscalculation by Border saw his main strike\nWorld Cup Debut\n\n\n\n\fbowler McDermott bowl the penultimate over from which he\nconceded just six runs and now  were needed from the last over by\noff-spinner Tom Moody. Kiran More smashed the first two to the\nboundary. But he was bowled next ball, trying to finish the game with\nanother four. Prabhakar scored a single from the first ball he faced and\nwas run out from the next. Four runs were now needed from the last\nball. Srinath swung hard and connected cleanly, sending the ball\nsoaring down to the fine leg boundary for what appeared to be a certain\nsix and victory. Indeed, last man Raju was already doing a victory jig.\nThen came the final breathtaking twist. At full tilt, Steve Waugh ran\nround and reached for the catch, only to drop it even as the crowd\ngasped in dis belie\u00a3 Waugh grabbed the ball as it slid towards the gutter\nwhile Srinath and Raju ran for their lives, and threw as the batsmen\nwere crossing for the third run that would have tied the game. The\nthrow was wayward and Boon, keeping in place of the injured Healy,\nhad to drag it in, but he managed to remove the bails a split second\nbefore Raju could complete the run. Australia had won by one run,\njust as they had at Chennai in the opening match of the  Reliance\nCup, which they went on to lift. Finally, it looked like their defence of\nthe title was back on the rails. India could only curse the wretched rain\nrule.\nThe round-robin format of the World Cup ensured that all the\nteams played each other before the knockout stage. Thus, for the first\ntime in five World Cup tournaments, India and Pakistan would come\nface to face. Until now, organizers had made sure to place the traditional\nrivals in different groups. Even as India were looking for their first\nwin in the tournament, Pakistan were decidedly lucky to be saved by\nrain against England, at Adelaide, after crashing to  all out.\nThe two teams met at the Sydney Cricket Ground on  March\n. The pressure on both sides was intense. The crowd of ,\nwas almost entirely made up of expatriate Indians and Pakistanis.\nAzhar took first strike on winning the toss. The Indian total of\nfor  was built around Ajay Jadeja's  (he opened in place of Shastri)\nand Tendulkar's  not out from  balls. Kapil Dev provided the\nimpetus towards the end with a quick-fire . Pakistan began their\n\n\nSachin\n\n\frun chase with Azhar setting an attacking field from the start.\nInzamam-ul-Haq and Zahid Fazal both fell for two and at  for , the\nIndian bowlers had gained the upper hand. Opener Aamir Sohail and\nJaved Miandad began the rescue act in a partnership of, punctuated\nwith a confrontation between wicketkeeper More and Miandad. It\nwas Tendulkar who made the breakthrough, getting Sohail caught\nlow down at midwicket by Srikkanth for . Once Miandad had been\nbowled by Srinath for a painstaking , the rest of the batting fell apart\nand subsided to  all out, leaving India winners by  runs and\nTendulkar with his first Man of the Match award in the World Cup.\nMter all the frustration with the rain rule in the match against\nAustralia, things evened out for India in the next match against\nZimbabwe in Hamilton, New Zealand. The match was initially\ncurtailed to  overs. Zimbabwe's innings was terminated by another\ndownpour, at  for  in . overs. Though India's score at the same\nstage was  for , their 'best'  overs had produced , hence the\nstrange calculations and victory to India by  runs.\nIndia opened with Kapil Dev, but it was Tendulkar who stole the\nshow. He smashed his highest ODI score of from  balls, with eight\nfours and a six, that saw them to  for . He mastered all the bowlers\nexcept veteran off-spinner John Traicos, who was  years older than\nhim. Traicos claimed - from his six overs. Though this contrived\nresult kept their hopes alive, India were struggling and it was no\nsurprise when they lost their next three matches against the West\nIndies, New Zealand and South Mrica, and made their exit from the\ntournament.\nTendulkar failed against the West Indies at Wellington, caught\nbehind off a perfect leg-cutter from Curtly Ambrose as India went\ndown by five wickets. He came roaring back against New Zealand,\novertaking his previous highest score of  by three runs. He was\ndropped early at short cover, after which he unleashed a range of\nsparkling strokes with six boundaries in his knock of  from \nballs. His stand of in  overs with Azhar produced some dazzling\nbatting in front ofa crowd of exactly . But it wasn't enough, as the\nhosts won by four wickets to make it six wins in a row. The Indians\nWorld Cup Debut\n\n\n\n\fweren't helped by the freezing conditions: Caris brook in Dunedin is\ncricket's closest venue  the South Pole. The defeat finally dashed\nwhatever slim hopes India may have harboured of reaching the semifinals. Their last match at Adelaide against South Mrica was once\nagain reduced hy rain. South Mrica won in the thirtieth and final over\nto make it to the last four in their maiden World Cup.\nIt was an unhappy end to a disappointing campaign by the \nWorld Cup champions.\nTendulkar's personal total of runs came from seven innings at\nan average of ., with three s. He was now emerging as the\nteam's potential match winner. 'His contributions were consistent,\nbut not enough,' summed up manager Abbas Ali Baig.\nPakistan were the surprise winners of the World Cup final at the\nMelbourne Cricket Ground (MeG) on  March.

When\nTendulkar first came to Pakistan in , his timing was very\ngood. Tendulkar's innings management is much better than\nInzamam's. He times the ball very well and he manages his\ninnings to perfection. But I still say that Inzamam is a much\nbetter batsman against fast bowlers. He has played a number of\nmatch-winning innings for Pakistan against quality fast\nbowlers, whereas I don't think Tendulkar has played that many\nmatch-winning knocks for India. There are lots of other\nbatsmen I would like to mention. Allan Border and Javed\nMiandad were not that talented, but the big plus of these\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fbatsmen was that they were very good at building their\ninnings-a quality which certainly Tendulkar has.\n\nWorld Cup Debut\n\n\n\n\fII\n\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\nNo one could have done a betterjob if breaking the ice.\n- Geoffrey Boycott\nFew Indian cricketers have enjoyed long stints in English county\ncricket. Kapil Dev, Ravi Shastri and Azharuddin played briefly for\nNorthamptonshire, Glamorgan and Derbyshire respectively, while\nin more rect:nt years Javagal Srinath, Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid\nand Sourav Ganguly have turned out for various teams with mixed\nresults. Sunil Gavaskar played just one season, and that was in \nfor Somerset. The only Indian who made a career out of county cricket\nwas wicketkeeper-batsman Farokh Engineer who was part of the\nLancashire squad that enjoyed much one-day success in the s.\nSachin Tendulkar had made a huge impression on the English public\nand the media on his first tour in . His century at Old Trafford at\nthe age of  had captured public imagination. It wasn't surprising,\ntherefore, that he should receive an offer to play county cricket. The\nreal surprise was that the offer came from Yorkshire.\nWhile county cricket had been thrown open to foreign professionals\nfrom the s-and many played in England long before that toothe only county that did not allow 'outsiders' to be part of their team\nwas Yorkshire, also the most successful team in county cricket history.\nCricket is part of the Yorkshire ethos, much as it is in Mumbai, or in\nVictoria and New South Wales in Australia. Great pride is taken in\nbeing able to wear the Yorkshire colours and there is a saying that\n'When Yorkshire is strong, England is strong.' Yorkshire, in fact,\nextended their ban on outsiders to anyone born outside the boundaries\n\n\fof the county. Along with their pride came a sense of parochialism and\nin more recent years, charges of racism. It is ironical given the large\npopulation of Pakistani immigrants, particularly in Bradford, that\nYorkshire has never awarded a county cap to even those Asians born\nwithin its boundaries. To add to their reputation, the crowd at\nHcadingley, Leeds was often virulent in its taunts and slurs.\nWhile other teams were marching ahead with their overseas stars,\nYorkshire cricket went from bad to worse. They had last won the\ncounty title in  and in  they took the wooden spoon for the\nfirst time. The team was also riven asunder by internal squabbles that\ncaused immense bitterness in the s and beyond. In frustration,\nmany of its best players migrated to other counties. Finally, Australian\nfast bowler Craig McDermott was signed up on a three-year contract\nstarting from . But injury forced him to pull out. Former Yorkshire\ncaptain Geoffrey Boycott, the focus ofa great deal of controversy at the\nclub during his playing days, then decided to sign up Tendulkar in\nplace of McDermott. He came up against opposition from another\nformer captain, Brian Close, the chairman of the Cricket Committee.\nClose was adamant that a fast bowler should replace McDermott. But\nwith time running out, a lack of international fast bowlers to choose\nfrom, and sponsors Yorkshire Television keen on a big-name signing,\nthe final choice remained Tendulkar. And it proved to be an inspired\none, more off the field than on it.\nThe deal was worth \u00a3, to Sachin. Yorkshire ChiefExecutive\nChris Hassell flew to Mumbai in April  for the signing, which\nTendulkar agreed to after receiving the stamp of approval from coach\nRamakant Achrekar and mentor Sunil Gavaskar. Yorkshire were keen\nto shake off the racist tag and also to attract more Asians to their\nmatches. But, while they may have succeeded to a limited extent in\nthe PR department, there was hardly a surge of interest among the\nimmigrants. As Michael Calvin pointed out in the Daily Telegraph, the\nimmigrants mainly consisted of Pakistanis who were not particularly\nenthused by the presence ofTendulkar. For his part, Tendulkar fitted\nin remarkably well, considering he was just  and aware that there\nwas a fair amount of opposition to the century-old 'no outsiders'\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n\n\n\ftradition being dismantled in his favour. A Press Association photograph\nthat was published in virtually every Indian newspaper showed him\ngamely attired in a Yorkshire flat hat, in his hand a glass of Tetley\nBitter beer, one of the team's sponsors.\nOn the field, he was consistent without being spectacular. There\nwas just one century (exactly  vDurham) and seven s in a total\nof  championship runs from  innings at ., placing him\nfortieth in the year's averages. In the Sunday League ( overs), his\nbest was  from  balls against Lancashire. The century against\nDurham powered Yorkshire to victory after they had been set a target\nof. Teammate Phil Carrick was quoted on that innings by Scyld\nBerry in Wisden Cricket Monthly Oune ):\nI walked over to have a chat with him as he came in and I\nremember him staring at me quite intently-perhaps he\ncouldn't understand me! I passed on some information, then I\nthought: 'what am I doing telling him?' You could tell he had\na fantastic talent, class oozing through every vein.\nI told him it was the sort ofwicket where you couldn't hit it on\nthe up, and shortly after he came in he smashed one straight\npast Ian Botham. It was a full-length ball, so I thought, 'well, he\nmight have heard me,' and he went on to win the match. The\nonly criticism that you could make was that sometimes he'd be\na bit impetuous, he'd get to  or  and set the game up, then\nget out in ways he wouldn't do now. He'd never play for\nhimself-in fact we wished he would bat for himself a bit more.\nOtherwise he made an ideal first overseas player, for us and\nhim. He contributed a few ideas and in the dressing-room he\nused to fiddle with his bats-tremendously heavy bats-or\nlisten to his music, and just get on with it.\nAgainst Essex he struck a classy  as Yorkshire won by a huge\nmargin of an innings and  runs. The Roses match saw him strike \nnot out and  as Yorkshire beat traditional rivals Lancashire by four\nwickets. In addition, he struck  against Hampshire and a brilliant\n\n\nSachin\n\n\f against Gloucestershire. Yorkshire's downward slide, however,\ncontinued as they fell two places to finish sixteenth in the county\nchampionship and eight places to fifteenth in the Sunday League.\nSachin's real success was in breaking down barriers and creating\ngoodwill wherever he went, with colleagues, fans and the media.\nBoycott summed it up in his book, Gec!lfrey Boycott on Cricket: 'He had\na lot to prove. If he had tailed with the bat or behaved carelessly, the\noutcome would almost certainly have been disastrous. Happily, we\npicked a winner. Unfailingly well-mannered and charming, with a\nshy smile on his lips, he settled quickly into the dressing room, and\nthe Yorkshire public, shrugging off their reservations, took him to\ntheir collective .heart. No one could have done a better job ofbreaking\nthe ice on behalf of the imports.'\nThe positive reaction in the Yorkshire county circles paved the\nway the next year for West Indian captain Richie Richardson to join\nthe team. In , Yorkshire won the county title for the first time\nsince . Their match winner throughout the season was Darren\nLehmann, an Australian left-bander not good enough for the\nAustralian touring side, but good enough to finish second in the\nnational averages that season.\nTendulkar has always looked back on his county stint with affection.\n'It was a tremendous experience and exposure and, in many respects, a\nhighlight for me, particularly as I was the first overseas player to play\nfor Yorkshire,' he told Sebastian Coe of the Daily Telegraph ( May\n). 'I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer, but there was just no way I\ncould combine five months' commitment to the Indian team with a\ncounty season. I don't think it will be possible for me to play for a\ncounty again.' According to Boycott, writing in Outlook ( January\n): 'Yorkshire supporters loved him. Sachin played well for a\nmedium team but at the age of he was not the finished article. We\ndidn't expect him to be but he created an enormous amount of interest\nand left behind tremendous goodwill. I wouldn't have swapped him\nfor any other player.'\nTendulkar's season was curtailed when on  August he was\nsummoned by the BCCI to play in the Duleep Trophy. As if he were\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n\n\n\fstill on trial! He was interviewed by Andrew Collomose for the Cricketer\nInternational (November ), at Scarborough, during his last game\nagainst Nottinghamshire. Wrote Collomose of 'Yorkshire's Fresh\nSpice': 'Tendulkar's warmth, courtesy and obvious enthusiasm for\nthe cause quickly made a nonsense of unspoken pre-season fears that\nthe racist element among Yorkshire followers would sour his season\nbefore it really got underway. \"It is a time I will treasure,\" said\nTendulkar. ... \"Everywhere I have played, both in Yorkshire and\nelsewhere, people have gone out of their way to be friendly. Yes, I was\na little nervous when I first arrived in England. Yorkshire is such a\nfamous county and I was going to be their first overseas player. It was\na big responsibility. But my only regret is that it took me so long to\nscore a hundred. At one stage it seemed I would never do so.\"'\nHe shared a flat in Dews bury with old school chum Vinod Kambli\nwho was playing with Spen Victoria in the Bradford League. Despite\nthe numerous Indian restaurants in the county, they ate mostly\nChinese, or a pizza, or maybe a Kentucky Fried or something at\nMcDonald's. 'The Indian food over here is not quite the same as I am\nused to at home. Not enough fresh spices.'\nIn late , India were invited to be the first team to play in South\nMrica since the apartheid ban imposed in . With Nelson Mandela\nall set to assume leadership of the 'new' South Africa, it was a historic\nvisit in many ways. Indeed, from the moment they landed till the end\nof the tour, the Indians were feted and felicitated wherever they went,\nparticularly by the local Indian community which tended to go\noverboard in its enthusiasm. One of the Indian team's sponsors who\ntravelled with the team confided to me that such was the hectic round\nof parties and functions, there were occasions when Sachin would\nhide in his room to avoid attending them!\nDr Ali Bacher dubbed the visit 'The Friendship Tour'. It may have\nbeen so off the field. But the cricket itself was very hard fought, at\ntimes even bitter, with the home side determined to give their fans a\ntaste of victory after more than two decades. The Indian team had\nearlier made a brief stopover in Harare en route to South Mrica, where\nZimbabwe gave a pretty good account of themselves in their maiden\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fTest. The Test marked the second occasion on which Tendulkarwas\nout for a duck, caught and bowled by master off-spinner John Traicos.\nThe one-day festival match at Raadjasfontein that kicked off the\nSouth Mrican tour saw Tendulkar score a century against Nicky\nOppenheimer's XI. The series began in right earnest at Durban with\nSouth Mrican opener Jimmy Cook out to the first ball of the series,\ncaught by Tendulkar at third slip offKapil Dev. This was South Mrica's\nsecond Test after readmission, having been stunned earlier in the year\nby the West Indies in Barbados. The weather had the final say at\nDurban, with more than a day lost to rain, and the match ended in a\ntame draw. But there were quite a few interesting events that captured\nthe attention of cricket historians. Left-arm spinner Omar Henry, at\n South Mrica's oldest debutant, also became the first non-white to\nplay for his country. South Mrican captain Kepler Wessels, who had\nearlier represented his adopted country, Australia, in Test cricket,\nbecame the first to score a century for two different countries. Ramakant\nAchrekar's 'boy' Praveen Amre became the ninth Indian to score a\ncentury on Test debut.\nThe most dramatic moment of the match came on  November\n, the second day of the Test. Tendulkar was on  and the total on\n for . He played a ball from Brian McMillan backward of point, set\noff for a run and then changed his mind as Jonty Rhodes swooped and\nthrew the ball to Andrew Hudson. The batsman tried to make his\nground even as short leg Hudson, up at the stumps, took the flat throw\non the bounce and broke the wicket. It appeared desperately close and\nSouth Mrican Cyril Mitchley at square leg passed the decision to the\numpires' room, outlining the shape of a TV screen with his hands.\nThird umpire Karl Liebenberg was sitting in front of the TV, and \nseconds later came his response: a green light flashed (for 'go' rather\nthan red for 'stay'-the reverse works now) and Tendulkar made his\nway back, the first cricketer to go through a trial by TV. So close was the\nverdict that he may well have gained the benefit of the doubt if the onfield umpire hadn't had the benefit of calling for the replay. Cricket\nhad entered the technological age, at last.\nThe fact that this new technology did not find universal acceptance\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n\n\n\feven among the umpires may well have cost India the second Test at\nJohannesburg. West Indian Steve Bucknor was the neutral umpire\nstanding in the series. Ironically, it was Jhonty Rhodes who gained the\nreprieve. South Mrica were  for  in their first innings, with Rhodes\non , when Srinath threw down the stumps with a direct throw. But\nBucknor ruled it not out without consulting the third umpire, despite\npleas from the fielding side. The TV replays showed Rhodes clearly\nshort of the crease. He went on to score  and took his side to the\nrespectable score of . It was a mistake no international umpire\nwould make again.\nIndia too lost early wickets. It was  for  when Tend ulkar walked\nin. Two more wickets fell for the addition of SO, and at  for , there\nwas the looming threat of a follow-on. Tendulkar started hesitantly.\nHe took  balls to get off the mark and was dropped at ten by Craig\nMatthews off Donald. His  came from  balls, his century from\n, and there were  fours in his  before he was ninth out at ,\ncaught Hudson by Cronje. He had been at the crease for  minutes.\nHis fourth Test century made him the youngest in Test hitory to\nreach  runs, at the age of years  days. Teammate Kapil Dev\nat  years  days was the previous record holder. It was Tendulkar's\nnineteenth Test and twenty-eighth innings.\nThese are the bald statistical details. They do not convey his power\nthat day at the Wanderers where the mighty Donald was blasted out of\nsight. Once again, Sachin played a lone hand, battling to pull his team\nout of a hole, making full use of his favourite square cut and square\ndrive. Time and again, Donald and McMillan bounced at him and\nTendulkar went up on his toes and used his powerful wrists to play\nattacking strokes to deliveries that were at least shoulder high. In an\nIndian total of, Tendulkar scored virtually half the runs off his\nown bat. Thanks to his effort and  for  from Ani! Kumble in South\nMrica's second innings, India gained a face-saving draw. Once again,\nthe luminaries of cricket were ecstatic in their reaction to Tendulkar's\nbatting. One of South Mrica's best all-rounders, Eddie Barlow, had\nthis to say: 'He has the technique which is the hallmark of a great\nplayer. Everything indicates that he will be a great player and I am\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fsure he will prove me right. Under incredible pressure, he batted\nsuperbly. Like Barry Richards he is very straight, very compact. He\nmoves his feet very quickly into position and can adjust to the pace\nand bounce superbly' (Sportstar,  December ).\nBetween the second and third Tests, India and South Africa played\na series of seven One-day Internationals. Tendulkar was a major\ndisappointment, with only  runs from seven innings, and a highest\nscore of. India were beaten -.\nDonald came into his own in the third Test at Port Elizabeth and\nIndia were crushed by nine wickets. There was an extraordinary\ncentury by Kapil Devin the second innings. But it was not enough to\nstop Donald bowling South Africa to their first victory in  years\nwith the devastating figures of  for  and  for . There were,\nunfortunately; plenty of umpiring disputes during the match, with\nthe visitors feeling they had got a raw deal. Perhaps the most shocking\nwas umpire Rudi Koertzen's decision to give Tendulkar caught behind\nfirst ball off Donald in the second innings, when the ball had brushed\nhis pad. The departing batsman was horrified and non-striker Shastri\ndropped his bat in disgust and had words with the umpire.\nMuch of the cricket played in the three Tests had been dreary. But\nthe fourth and final match at Cape Town made a dubious entry into\ncricket's record books as the slowest of all time. The Indian batsmen\nwere wary of the South African pace attack. The hosts were keen to\nhang on to their lead in order to wrap up the series. This they achieved\neven as the Test produced an average of runs per day at . per\nover. Tendulkar was his side's. top scorer in the match with . But\neven his normally attacking batsmanship was curtailed, the  taking\nhim  minutes. For Kepler Wessels and his countrymen, the series\nmarked a triumphant return to Test cricket. The story was starkly\ndifferent in the rival camp, with Azharuddin seemingly on his way\nout as captain after another series defeat and a lacklustre batting\nperformance.\n\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n Two Little Bits of Cricket History\n\nNo one could have done a betterjob if breaking the ice.\n- Geoffrey Boycott\nFew Indian cricketers have enjoyed long stints in English county\ncricket.

Yorkshire's downward slide, however,\ncontinued as they fell two places to finish sixteenth in the county\nchampionship and eight places to fifteenth in the Sunday League.\nSachin's real success was in breaking down barriers and creating\ngoodwill wherever he went, with colleagues, fans and the media.\nBoycott summed it up in his book, Gec!lfrey Boycott on Cricket: 'He had\na lot to prove. If he had tailed with the bat or behaved carelessly, the\noutcome would almost certainly have been disastrous. Happily, we\npicked a winner. Unfailingly well-mannered and charming, with a\nshy smile on his lips, he settled quickly into the dressing room, and\nthe Yorkshire public, shrugging off their reservations, took him to\ntheir collective .heart. No one could have done a better job ofbreaking\nthe ice on behalf of the imports.'\nThe positive reaction in the Yorkshire county circles paved the\nway the next year for West Indian captain Richie Richardson to join\nthe team. In , Yorkshire won the county title for the first time\nsince . Their match winner throughout the season was Darren\nLehmann, an Australian left-bander not good enough for the\nAustralian touring side, but good enough to finish second in the\nnational averages that season.\nTendulkar has always looked back on his county stint with affection.\n'It was a tremendous experience and exposure and, in many respects, a\nhighlight for me, particularly as I was the first overseas player to play\nfor Yorkshire,' he told Sebastian Coe of the Daily Telegraph ( May\n). 'I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer, but there was just no way I\ncould combine five months' commitment to the Indian team with a\ncounty season. I don't think it will be possible for me to play for a\ncounty again.' According to Boycott, writing in Outlook ( January\n): 'Yorkshire supporters loved him. Sachin played well for a\nmedium team but at the age of he was not the finished article. We\ndidn't expect him to be but he created an enormous amount of interest\nand left behind tremendous goodwill. I wouldn't have swapped him\nfor any other player.'\nTendulkar's season was curtailed when on  August he was\nsummoned by the BCCI to play in the Duleep Trophy. As if he were\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n\n\n\fstill on trial! He was interviewed by Andrew Collomose for the Cricketer\nInternational (November ), at Scarborough, during his last game\nagainst Nottinghamshire. Wrote Collomose of 'Yorkshire's Fresh\nSpice': 'Tendulkar's warmth, courtesy and obvious enthusiasm for\nthe cause quickly made a nonsense of unspoken pre-season fears that\nthe racist element among Yorkshire followers would sour his season\nbefore it really got underway. \"It is a time I will treasure,\" said\nTendulkar. ... \"Everywhere I have played, both in Yorkshire and\nelsewhere, people have gone out of their way to be friendly. Yes, I was\na little nervous when I first arrived in England. Yorkshire is such a\nfamous county and I was going to be their first overseas player. It was\na big responsibility. But my only regret is that it took me so long to\nscore a hundred. At one stage it seemed I would never do so.\"'\nHe shared a flat in Dews bury with old school chum Vinod Kambli\nwho was playing with Spen Victoria in the Bradford League. Despite\nthe numerous Indian restaurants in the county, they ate mostly\nChinese, or a pizza, or maybe a Kentucky Fried or something at\nMcDonald's. 'The Indian food over here is not quite the same as I am\nused to at home. Not enough fresh spices.'\nIn late , India were invited to be the first team to play in South\nMrica since the apartheid ban imposed in . With Nelson Mandela\nall set to assume leadership of the 'new' South Africa, it was a historic\nvisit in many ways. Indeed, from the moment they landed till the end\nof the tour, the Indians were feted and felicitated wherever they went,\nparticularly by the local Indian community which tended to go\noverboard in its enthusiasm. One of the Indian team's sponsors who\ntravelled with the team confided to me that such was the hectic round\nof parties and functions, there were occasions when Sachin would\nhide in his room to avoid attending them!\nDr Ali Bacher dubbed the visit 'The Friendship Tour'. It may have\nbeen so off the field. But the cricket itself was very hard fought, at\ntimes even bitter, with the home side determined to give their fans a\ntaste of victory after more than two decades. The Indian team had\nearlier made a brief stopover in Harare en route to South Mrica, where\nZimbabwe gave a pretty good account of themselves in their maiden\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fTest. The Test marked the second occasion on which Tendulkarwas\nout for a duck, caught and bowled by master off-spinner John Traicos.\nThe one-day festival match at Raadjasfontein that kicked off the\nSouth Mrican tour saw Tendulkar score a century against Nicky\nOppenheimer's XI. The series began in right earnest at Durban with\nSouth Mrican opener Jimmy Cook out to the first ball of the series,\ncaught by Tendulkar at third slip offKapil Dev. This was South Mrica's\nsecond Test after readmission, having been stunned earlier in the year\nby the West Indies in Barbados. The weather had the final say at\nDurban, with more than a day lost to rain, and the match ended in a\ntame draw. But there were quite a few interesting events that captured\nthe attention of cricket historians. Left-arm spinner Omar Henry, at\n South Mrica's oldest debutant, also became the first non-white to\nplay for his country. South Mrican captain Kepler Wessels, who had\nearlier represented his adopted country, Australia, in Test cricket,\nbecame the first to score a century for two different countries. Ramakant\nAchrekar's 'boy' Praveen Amre became the ninth Indian to score a\ncentury on Test debut.\nThe most dramatic moment of the match came on  November\n, the second day of the Test. Tendulkar was on  and the total on\n for . He played a ball from Brian McMillan backward of point, set\noff for a run and then changed his mind as Jonty Rhodes swooped and\nthrew the ball to Andrew Hudson. The batsman tried to make his\nground even as short leg Hudson, up at the stumps, took the flat throw\non the bounce and broke the wicket. It appeared desperately close and\nSouth Mrican Cyril Mitchley at square leg passed the decision to the\numpires' room, outlining the shape of a TV screen with his hands.\nThird umpire Karl Liebenberg was sitting in front of the TV, and \nseconds later came his response: a green light flashed (for 'go' rather\nthan red for 'stay'-the reverse works now) and Tendulkar made his\nway back, the first cricketer to go through a trial by TV. So close was the\nverdict that he may well have gained the benefit of the doubt if the onfield umpire hadn't had the benefit of calling for the replay. Cricket\nhad entered the technological age, at last.\nThe fact that this new technology did not find universal acceptance\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n\n\n\feven among the umpires may well have cost India the second Test at\nJohannesburg. West Indian Steve Bucknor was the neutral umpire\nstanding in the series. Ironically, it was Jhonty Rhodes who gained the\nreprieve. South Mrica were  for  in their first innings, with Rhodes\non , when Srinath threw down the stumps with a direct throw. But\nBucknor ruled it not out without consulting the third umpire, despite\npleas from the fielding side. The TV replays showed Rhodes clearly\nshort of the crease. He went on to score  and took his side to the\nrespectable score of . It was a mistake no international umpire\nwould make again.\nIndia too lost early wickets. It was  for  when Tend ulkar walked\nin. Two more wickets fell for the addition of SO, and at  for , there\nwas the looming threat of a follow-on. Tendulkar started hesitantly.\nHe took  balls to get off the mark and was dropped at ten by Craig\nMatthews off Donald. His  came from  balls, his century from\n, and there were  fours in his  before he was ninth out at ,\ncaught Hudson by Cronje. He had been at the crease for  minutes.\nHis fourth Test century made him the youngest in Test hitory to\nreach  runs, at the age of years  days. Teammate Kapil Dev\nat  years  days was the previous record holder. It was Tendulkar's\nnineteenth Test and twenty-eighth innings.\nThese are the bald statistical details. They do not convey his power\nthat day at the Wanderers where the mighty Donald was blasted out of\nsight. Once again, Sachin played a lone hand, battling to pull his team\nout of a hole, making full use of his favourite square cut and square\ndrive. Time and again, Donald and McMillan bounced at him and\nTendulkar went up on his toes and used his powerful wrists to play\nattacking strokes to deliveries that were at least shoulder high. In an\nIndian total of, Tendulkar scored virtually half the runs off his\nown bat. Thanks to his effort and  for  from Ani! Kumble in South\nMrica's second innings, India gained a face-saving draw. Once again,\nthe luminaries of cricket were ecstatic in their reaction to Tendulkar's\nbatting. One of South Mrica's best all-rounders, Eddie Barlow, had\nthis to say: 'He has the technique which is the hallmark of a great\nplayer. Everything indicates that he will be a great player and I am\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fsure he will prove me right. Under incredible pressure, he batted\nsuperbly. Like Barry Richards he is very straight, very compact. He\nmoves his feet very quickly into position and can adjust to the pace\nand bounce superbly' (Sportstar,  December ).\nBetween the second and third Tests, India and South Africa played\na series of seven One-day Internationals. Tendulkar was a major\ndisappointment, with only  runs from seven innings, and a highest\nscore of. India were beaten -.\nDonald came into his own in the third Test at Port Elizabeth and\nIndia were crushed by nine wickets. There was an extraordinary\ncentury by Kapil Devin the second innings. But it was not enough to\nstop Donald bowling South Africa to their first victory in  years\nwith the devastating figures of  for  and  for . There were,\nunfortunately; plenty of umpiring disputes during the match, with\nthe visitors feeling they had got a raw deal. Perhaps the most shocking\nwas umpire Rudi Koertzen's decision to give Tendulkar caught behind\nfirst ball off Donald in the second innings, when the ball had brushed\nhis pad. The departing batsman was horrified and non-striker Shastri\ndropped his bat in disgust and had words with the umpire.\nMuch of the cricket played in the three Tests had been dreary. But\nthe fourth and final match at Cape Town made a dubious entry into\ncricket's record books as the slowest of all time. The Indian batsmen\nwere wary of the South African pace attack. The hosts were keen to\nhang on to their lead in order to wrap up the series. This they achieved\neven as the Test produced an average of runs per day at . per\nover. Tendulkar was his side's. top scorer in the match with . But\neven his normally attacking batsmanship was curtailed, the  taking\nhim  minutes. For Kepler Wessels and his countrymen, the series\nmarked a triumphant return to Test cricket. The story was starkly\ndifferent in the rival camp, with Azharuddin seemingly on his way\nout as captain after another series defeat and a lacklustre batting\nperformance.\n\nTwo Little Bits of Cricket History\n\n\n Success at Home and Abroad\n\nifthey want me to be captain, I'm ready .-Sachin Tendulkar\nEngland's tour to India under the captaincy of Graham Gooch saw\nMohammed Azharuddin placed on probation, in a manner of\nspeaking. His appointment was confirmed only till the first Test in\nKolkata in january . Two oms were played before the opening\nTest, with honours even.\nThe season unfolding would be an extraordinary one for Vinod\nKambli. Briefly, he would gallop ahead of his old school friend. The\ntrend was set in the first  atjaipur, which England won by four\nwickets after a scrambled single from the last ball of the match. It was\nKambli's twentieth birthday and he celebrated it in style with his first\ncentury in international cricket. His score of not out came from\n balls and there was some adverse comment at the end of the game\nover the manner in which he crawled through the s. The feeling\nwas that India lost precious momentum which cost it dearly in the\nend.\nThe old Sharadashram pair got together atjaipur after Prabhakar,\nSidhu and Azharuddin had been sent back with just  on the board.\nThey batted till the end of the innings with Kambli reaching his\ncentury in the last over. Sachin stayed unbeaten on a rapid  and was\non hand to congratulate his friend. Once again, an om century had\nproved elusive for him. The unbroken stand was worth  (in \novers)--exactly  less than their world record for Sharadashram\njust five years earlier!\n\n\fKambli was quick to give credit to Tendulkar while receiving the\nMan of the Match award. He told the media emotionally that it was\nhis friend's calming influence at the wicket that had helped him to the\nlandmark. 'I will never forget Sachin's birthday gift to me,' were his\nwords.\nBoth batsmen failed in the second om at Chandigarh, though India\nwon by five wickets to draw level. The sword which has traditionally\nbeen placed over the head of the Indian captain was perilously close to\ncutting short Azharuddin's reign when the teams moved to Kolkata\nfor the first Test. It was here, against England at the Eden Gardens,\nthat Azhar ~ad first dazzled the cricket world with his century on\ndebut in the - series, followed by two more on the trot. Now,\nonce again, the lucky charm that had always followed him to Kolkata\nseemed to work its magic. The captain's dazzling  crushed\nEngland's spirits and victory was India's by nine wickets. Tendulkar's\n in the first innings promised much more before he had a lapse of\nconcentration and fished at a wide delivery from Devon Malcolm. By\nthen, the stand witli his captain was worth  runs. Kambli on his\nTest debut had scores of and  not out. With just a handful of runs\nneeded for the win after England had followed on, Sachin and Vi nod\nwere at the crease when India wrapped things up before lunch on the\nfifth day.\nJust as Eden Gardens in Kolkata was Azhar's favourite venue, the\nMA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai is where Tendulkar has scored\nthe maximum runs. In February , Chepauk was witness to\nTendulkar's first century at home and his fifth overall. This was in his\ntwenty-third Test match, ofwhich only two-one at Kolkata and before\nthat the Chandigarh one-off against Sri Lanka-had been played at\nhome. In , an outstanding innings against Australia saw Sachin\nmaster Shane Warne at Chepauk. But there was heartbreak in :\nanother masterly ton took India to the doorstep of victory against\nPakistan before Sachin's back gave way and India fell just short. Three\nyears later, in March , Tendulkar recorded his twenty-fifth Test\ncentury at Chennai as India stunned world champions Australia to\ntake the series -.\nSuccess at Home and Abroad\n\n]\n\n\fThere was drama even before the start of the second Test in Chennai\nin . England's captain Graham Gooch was forced out by sickness,\nthanks to a plate of prawns he had eaten the night before. The\ndemoralized Englishmen were forced to follow-on for the second time\nin successive Tests and lost by an innings. This, after their bowlers\nhad conceded the highest total against India at home. The massive\n for  declared was built around centuries by Navjot Singh Sidhu\nand Tendulkar, who made the highest ofhis five Test centuries in an\ninnings spanning nearly six hours. Kambli (in his second Test), Anre\nand Kapil Dev also chipped in with half-centuries.\nAlready there was talk of how Tendulkar in the years to come\nwould challenge Allan Border's record Test aggregate. And for the\nfirst time the comparison with the great West Indian Viv Richards,\none ofTendulkar's heroes, was made, this time by the former England\nall-rounder Vic Marks. I noticed too, for the first time, that Tendulkar\nwas taking over some of the field-placing chores from his captain who\nlooked on benignly. There was no talk at this stage of Tendulkar\nassuming the captaincy. But there were moves to groom him in the\nrole of vice captain. There were a couple of incidents on the field\nduring this match which showed Sachin's versatility. Though he\nbowled just two overs in each innings, he surprised the cognoscenti\nby bowling genuine leg breaks. He even pulled off the perfect googly\nfor good measure. And there was a dazzling catch to top it all. Paul\nJarvis flicked Kumble hard and low in the second innings, only to be\ngobbled up at short leg by Sachin, an outstanding catch at ankle height\nfrom a legitimate shot. There was no doubt after that, about the choice\nfor the Man of the Match.\nIndia had won the series. And the third and final Test in Mumbai\nproved to be the final nail in the coffin for the English team. A new\nrecord total by India at home, and another innings victory. For the first\ntime, India had accomplished a series whitewash. The Test was a\ntriumph for the Mumbai trio of Kambli, Tendulkar and Amre,\nparticularly the left-hander. In only his third Test match, Kambli had\ncompiled the highest score by an Indian batsman against England:\n. He joined a band of  others whose first three-figure knocks\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fwere over , among them two legendary left-banders, Garry Sobers\nand Brian Lara. Kambli stayed at the crease for nearly ten hours and\nfaced  deliveries. The English bowling attack of Phil DeFreitas,\nChris Lewis, john Emburey and Phil Tufnell could hardly be called\nthreatening. The third wicket stand with Tendulkar was worth \nruns in  overs, with the senior partner somewhat subdued. His \ntook nearly four and a half hours and was not nearly as flawless as his\nbatting in the previous Test. Kambli had two reprieves, at  and .\nNerves got the better ofhim as he approached the highest score (at the\ntime) by an Indian in Tests:  not out by Sunil Gavaskar. Till then,\nhis daring stroke play was a wonderful treat for the fans at the Wankhede\nStadium.\nThe action now switched back to the one-day game and at least\nhere there was some consolation for the tourists. The series finished\nlevel at -, with neither Kambli nor Tendulkar being able to make\nmuch of an impact.\nBefore the series began, the selectors had named Tendulkar captain\nof the under- side which played against England at Cuttack prior to\nthe first Test. But a minor foot injury had forced him to miss that\ngame and Ajay Jadeja had taken over. He got his chance to lead in the\nthree-day game at Visakhapatnam between the first and second Test,\ncaptaining the Rest of India. Also in the team were W V Raman,\nSanjay Manrejkar and Salil Ankola, all with Test experience. Still two\nmonths shy of his twentieth birthday, Sachin appeared comfortable in\na rule he was handling for the first time, and termed the experience\n'interesting'.\n'I had to lead a relatively new side. There were players like\nAnanthapadmanabhan and U tpal Chatterjee whom I had never seen\nbefore, so it took me some time to settle down. I just wish it had been\na five-day game instead of a three-day one,' he recalled in Sportsworld\n(February ). No doubt the experience at Visakhapatnam gave\nhim the necessary confidence going into the Chennai Test. And\nperhaps Azharuddin was instructed by the selectors to allow the\nyoungster a little leeway in setting fields. In the same issue of\nSportsworld, chairman of the Selection Committee G.R.Visvanath\nSuccess at Home and Abroad\n\n\n\n\fdenied that Sachin was being groomed for captaincy. 'Basically Sachin\nis a very, very mature cricketer. We have noticed this maturity. It is not\nthat he is going to captain overnight, we're just trying to put a little\nconfidence into him. The fact is that he's going to be around for quite\na while and ifhe comes good as captain earlier than expected then it's\ngood for Indian cricket.'\nThe article proclaimed him the future captain of India. 'I don't\nmind taking up the challenge (of captaincy) anytime,' was the confident\nreply from the teenager when asked what would be the right time for\nsuch a move. 'It's not a question ofwhether I want to be captain or not.\nIt's like whatever the country needs I'm ready to do. If they want me to\nbe captain, I'm ready. If they want me to play in the side, I'm ready. If\nthey think I'm not good enough to be in the side, I'm ready to step\ndown.' Confident words from the -year-old.\nThe first step was taken with Sachin's appointment as vice captain\nfor the tour of Sri Lanka following the England series. But before that,\nthere was a one-off Test against Zimbabwe in New Delhi and once\nagain this was a triumph for Kambli-and how. He suddenly saw his\nname up alongside those ofWally Hammond and Don Bradman as\nthe only other batsman to score two consecutive Test double centuries.\nHe followed up his  at Mumbai with  in New Delhi, once\nagain coming agonizingly close to Gavaskar's all-time highest score.\nIt was heady stuf( He was the first Indian left-hander to score more\nthan one Test century and that too, in only his fourth Test. There was\nyet another century stand with Sachin (), and Arnre also contributed\na half-century as did Sidhu. India completed another innings victory\nagainst the hapless Zimbabweans for their fifth win in a row at home.\nTendulkar's start to his Test career had been steady without being\nextraordinary, though of course his youth had given it a romantic\nsheen. It had taken Kambli nearly four years to follow in Sachin's\nfootsteps. But the impact he made was immediate and spectacular.\nThat spectacular run would continue in Sri Lanka where India won a\nTest and a series abroad for the first time since England in  (an\nachievement they have not been able to equal, till the end of).\nThe first Test against Sri Lanka, at Kandy, was a washout with only\n\n\nSachin\n\n\f overs bowled. India won the second Test at Colombo's sse by \nruns as Tendulkar and Kambli both recorded centuries, though not in\nthe same innings. But incessant appealing and a great deal of\nresentment and rancour on the part of the Indians marred the match.\nThe objects of their ire were the umpires who the Indians accused of\nadopting different standards for the two teams. The conflict led to\nmatch referee Peter Burge bringing the two teams together at the end\nof the match and issuing them a stern warning about their conduct in\nthe next Test. Kambli was issued a reprimand by Burge for showing\ndissent after being given caught behind in the second innings.\nTendulkar too had got a dicey decision in the first innings when he\nwas adjudged caught at short leg for , when it was doubtful whether\nhe had played the ball.\nKambli's third hundred saw India score  in their first innings.\nAnil Kumble picked up five wickets as the home side trailed by .\nTendulkar was determined to make amends in the second innings as\nthe Indians went for quick runs and a declaration. There were three\ncenturies (and four near-centuries) in the Test. Tendulkar's was the\nmost attractive by far. At  he was dropped by Warnaweera at deep\nfine legoffWickramesinghe. Nothing could stop him from reaching\nhis sixth hundred after that. While Sidhu played the anchor role,\nTendulkar punched and drove the bowlers with ease and power. One\nshot in particular stood out amidst the  fours and a six-he lofted a\nhalf volley from Warna.weera over long on, with a fielder stationed on\nthe boundary. It was audacious stuff and allowed Azhar to declare at\n for . Tendulkar remained not out on . Sidhu recorded an\nidentical score, while Prabhakar struck .\nThe unlikely target for Sri Lanka was  and the best they could\ndo was hang on for a draw. By close on the fourth day, they had lost\nboth openers with  on the board. Aravinda de Silva's  held up the\nIndians on the final day and they finally finished it off after tea. It had\nbeen close, though the final margin of victory was substantial. It was\nAzhar's first win abroad after taking over three years ago, and would\nend up being India's only victory on foreign soil in the entire decade.\nThe third Test ended in a high-scoring draw. But not before Kambli\nSuccess at Home and Abroad\n\n\n\n\fhad recorded his fourth century in five Tests (including Kandy where\nhe did not bat). He was involved once again in the now almost\nobligatory century stand with his friend who managed . That helped\nTendulkar finish the series with an awesome average of., though\nit was Kambli who had the best aggregate\nWith Azhar off the field with flu, the vice captain got his chance to\nlead the side on the final day of the third Test. Writing in the Cricketer\nInternational (September ), Sri Lankan journalist Mahinda\nWijesinghe observed that 'It was refreshing to see young blood calming\nfrayed tempers and soothing unrequited appeals.' Sachin became the\nyoungest to lead a side in Test cricket-albeit in an acting capacity. He\nwas a y~ar younger than the Nawab ofPataudiJr. was when he led\nIndia to the West Indies in -. Tendulkar enjoyed the experience\nas he told Vijay Lokapally of the Spottstar, in September that year: 'I\nwas a little bit satisfied. But they played negative cricket and I hardly\ngot a chance to play a commanding role you expect a captain to play.\nYet I was more involved than I am normally.'\nIndia would have to wait seven years before they could emulate\nthe feat of another win abroad. Tend ulkar would be part of that match\nat Dhaka, but not Azhar. A lot would change in Indian (and world)\ncricket in the intervening years.\n\n\n\nSachin The Great Friendship\n\nHe took the elevator to the top and I took the stairs.-Vinod Kambli\nSachin Tendulkar first met Vinod Ganpat Kambli when he made the\nswitch from the New English School to Sharadashram Vidyamandir\n(English) at the age of . Kambli was a year older than Sachin and\nplayed in the same school team, for Mumbai and West Zone junior\n(under-) teams and then for the Mumbai Ranji Trophy side and\nfinally for India. Except perhaps for the odd match here and there,\nthey have not found themselves on opposing sides in nearly  years\nof knowing each other and playing cricket together.\nThe names Tendulkar and Kambli became inextricably linked after\nthe semi-final of the Harris Shield against St. Xavier's Fort at Azad\nMaidan. That game, played on - February , saw them\ninvolved in the world-record partnership of  (unbroken) for the\nthird wicket-a mark that is unlikely to be erased for a long, long\ntime. Suddenly the pair were the talk of Mumbai cricket circles. At\nschool level Vinod often outscored his friend. But Sachin made a\nrapid transition from school to first class and then Test cricket, while\nVinod lagged behind. Achrekar, who coached them both, told me:\n'Vinod scored more runs at school level. But he did not have the\ndedication or perseverance ofSachin, and also developed bad habits.\nSachin, on the other hand, always had a very sensible attitude and a\nstrong family background, especially with his father and brother Ajit\nalways behind him.'\nSachin made his Test debut in November  in Pakistan and\nless than a year later, in his ninth Test, scored his maiden century.\n\n\fKambli would follow him into Test cricket in the home series against\nEngland in . But while Tendulkar would have to wait till late\n to score his first Test double century, Kambli's very first threefigure knock was --in only his third Test.\nAs we have seen in the previous chapter, Kambli followed up that\n with  in the next Test and then two centuries in three Tests in\nSri Lanka. It was scintillating cricket. And suddenly comparisons were\nbeing made with Tendulkar, not all of them flattering for the younger\nman. 'He took the elevator to the top and I took the stairs,' is the way\nKambli described their varyingjourneys to the world of international\ncricket. Kambli made his international debut in October  in\nSharjah with scores of  not out,  and . A year later, he was\nchosen for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand after being\npassed up for the Test series in South Mrica and Australia. The story\ngoes that when Kambli landed in Sydney for the World Cup, he was\ndisappointed that his chum had not come to the airport to receive\nhim. But Sachin had stayed up the whole night in his hotel room,\nreading and watching television to keep himself awake for the late\nnight arrival. They spent the night chatting.\nIfTendulkar's de hut in first-class cricket was a remarkable one for\na schoolboy, Kambli's early career was notable for the mountain of\nruns he scored in his first three seasons, starting with his debut in\n-. He piled up  runs from only  games at the amazing\naverage of.. The tally included nine s (with a highest score of\n) and  half-centuries. So why did it take him four years to break\ninto Test cricket? To put it bluntly, Kambli had rapidly acquired an\n'image' problem. His West Indian-like appearance and hero worship\nofDesmond Haynes had earned him the nickname of'Dessy'. Haynes\nused to sport a bracelet on his wrist with the words 'Live, Love, Laugh'\ninscribed on it. Kambli perhaps took these words literally, particularly\nwhen he first broke into big-time cricket. Achrekar has always felt that\nKambli's flamboyant ways held him back in a cricket set-up that\ncontinues to be conservative. Flamboyance is acceptable on the field.\nBut once stories of off-field shenanigans began circulating, progress\nwas stymied.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fThere was an incident in the  World Cup that was held against\nKambli for quite sometime. It occured during a rain break in the\nmatch against Sri Lanka at Mackay when the cheerleaders were out\non the field keeping the crowd entertained. Kambli joined in the\ndancing and the photographers had a field day. But many thought that\nfor someone so fresh to the team, it was inappropriate behaviour, even\nbrash. Much has also been made ofKambli's social background and\nchildhood. It would be best to quote the man himself on this sensitive\naspect of his life. In an interview in  he revealed, 'I come from a\nvery, very poor family. My father was a machinist, worked in Bhandup\n[in Mumbai]. We lived in a chaw[ in Ka~ur Marg. Dad was a good\nfast bowler and played against many former Mumbai players, even\nTest cricketers. He had to look after seven of us, but he never made us\nfeel that we lacked anything.' (Redijfcom,  December )\nCricket elevated Kambli to a lifestyle he could only have dreamed\nof. Subsequent reports of'temptations' and 'distractions' during the\n World Cup didn't do his career any good. And the contrast with\nTendulkar could not have been starker. In an interview to the Sportstar\n( September ), Kambli himself explained the difference in their\noutlook to life: 'He [Sachin] is reserved. I am the outgoing type. I like\nto enjoy life. I always enjoyed life. People say I am fascinated with\njewellery. But I like wearing it and I earned the money to buy it. I may\ngo to a disco to unwind. There is life after cricket hours. People love\nclothes. Some wear sober clothes. I suppose I am the type who likes\ncolourful clothes. It all depends on your liking. I will not like to change\nmy lifestyle.' Kambli certainly could not be accused of hypocrisy. He\ndid nothing to hide his flamboyant ways. But this very frankness had\na negative effect on the authorities.\nIn the early years, Vinod and Sachin often found themselves batting\ntogether when one or the other reached a personal land mark, almost\nas if fate were playing a hand. The bonds of friendship were thus\nstrengthened and made public. Tendulkar was at the other end when\nKambli got his maiden century in One-day Internationals against\nEngland at Jaipur in . They were together when Vi nod got his\nfirst Test  in the second Test at Chennai shortly after that. And the\n\n\fvery next Test at Mumbai .saw them involved in a stand worth  as\nKambli struck his double ton. The second Test at Colombo later that\nyear which India won, saw them score centuries in the same match\nfor the first and only time so far.\nBy  there were rumours that Tendulkar was feeling pressurized\nby Kambli's success. This question was put to him by Sportstar (\nMarch ), at which stage he was yet to score a century in One-day\nInternationals. 'Rubbish, there is nothing like that,' Tendulkar\nshrugged off the suggestion. 'These things take place because people\njust assume things.' Kambli, for his part, has always expressed his\ngratitude to Sachin for his help and support. 'Sachin is my friend,\nphilosopher and guide,' he would repeatedly emphasize in interviews.\nThe no-om-century monkey was taken offTendulkar's back in\nthe Singer Cup match against Australia in Colombo on  September\n. It was five years since his international debut. And sure enough,\nKambli was at the non-striker's end to embrace him on reaching the\nlandmark.\nBut the contrast in their batting form was the starkest in the Hero\nCup five-nation tournament which India won at home in November\n. Kambli and Azhar were the outstanding batsmen in the\ntournament. Kambli had scores of, , , ,  and . Tendulkar,\non the other hand, could only score  (not out), , , ,  and \n(not out). But if one is to believe them, the competitive streak extends\nonly to their respective music collections. This is another shared\npassion and it became a race to see who had the bigger and better\ncollection. As Kambli put it in his interview on Rediff.com (December\n), 'Actually, whenever Sachin is there at the other end, the\nunderstanding between us is so good that if he hits a four, I don't take\nit as a challenge. If I get a loose delivery, I am going to whack it,\nanyway, but if I don't get one, no big deal. There has been no\ncompetition between us as such. I know people expect a lot of runs\nfrom me, just like they do from Sachin. I try my best to fulfil their\nexpectations. It's not that I don't try. I try, I try and I try. If I don't\nsucceed, even I feel bad about it. Everybody does.'\nIn the same interview Kambli explained how Sachin's presence in\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe team acted as an inspiration to him. 'He is such a thinking cricketer\nand a perfect team man. When I play alongside him, he helps me so\nmuch. Of course, he helps others as well. He provides a lot of\nmotivation to other players. His presence is very, very important in\nthe side for the others. Whenever we are together, we talk a lot about\ncricket. And I hope when I finally make a comeback, we will again do\nthe same. It will not only motivate me, it will help keep me upbeat.'\nKambli's first seven Tests fetched him  runs at an average of..\nHe was the quickest Indian to reach  Test runs, in  innings\nfrom  Tests. The earlier Indian record had stood in the name of\nSunil Gavaskar ( innings/ Tests) while the only batsmen quicker\nthan Kambli were Everton Weekes, Herbert Sutcliffe (both /) and\nDon Bradman (n). In contrast, it took Tendulkar  innings from\n Tests to reach . Of course, he was the youngest to do so. In fact,\nit was not till his forty-third first-class match (first Test v West Indies\nat Mumbai, November ) that Kambli was dismissed for a duck.\n'I'm no longer just Sachin's batting partner, I'm Vinod Kambli,' he\nproudly asserted after his second double century on the trot. But it did\nnot last very long.\nThe visit to Sri Lanka in  was one of the stormiest and most\ncontentious tours an Indian team has undertaken. As one of the leading\nIndian batsmen, Tendulkar was targeted by the appalling umpiring.\nWhile he refused to be provoked by some atrocious decisions, Kambli\ncould not keep his cool and received a reprimand from the match\nreferee for showing dissent. This provided yet another reminder of\ntheir contrasting temperaments. Also, despite all those runs early in\nhis career, there was always a lurking suspicion that Kambli would\nfind himself in trouble against top class fast bowling. The bulk of his\nruns had come in the subcontinent against the weaker bowling attacks\nofEngland, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. The West Indians soon sorted\nhim out when they toured India late in . Walsh and company\npeppered him with the short stuff. And suddenly, suspicions about his\nability to face quality fast bowling appeared to have been proved true.\nHe scraped together a miserable  runs from six innings in the Test\nseries.\nThe Great Friendship\n\nIll\n\n\fLater, in , one of the most enduring and poignant images of\nthe World Cup was that ofKambli coming off the field after the semifinal at Kolkata had been awarded to Sri Lanka followed crowd\ndisturbances. The tears flowed freely that night. For Kambli wears his\nheart on his sleeve. There was more anguish off the field too, during\nthe World Cup. Unruly behaviour at the team hotel, including public\nshouting matches with his newly married wife, left a very poor\nimpression on the team management. He was left out of the team that\ntoured England after the World Cup, apparently on disciplinary\ngrounds, and not for the last time.\nIt has been a virtual see-saw since then. He was picked for the\nplaying XI ahead ofSourav Ganguly for the Sahara Cup in Toronto\nin ---which inevitably led to whispered allegations of nepotism\nagainst Tendulkar who was captain then. In April , a serious\nankle injury while fielding as a substitute in the one-day game against\nAustralia at Cuttack saw him out of action for the rest of the year. He\nwas back for the visits to Sri Lanka and Singapore in September \nfor one-day tournaments. This was soon after Tendulkar had been\nasked to lead for the second time.\nThe new captain reacted angrily when asked the question by G.\nViswanath for the Sportstar ( August ): 'The selection ofVinod\nKambli. People have linked it to your friendship?'\nSachin replied, 'lfl were to pick friends, then my brother [Ajit]\nshould be there in the Indian team. He can also play cricket. It just\nsays about the mentality and petty-mindedness of the people who\nthink that he [Kambli] is there in the team because I am the captain.\nI am the captain of the Indian team and my only interest is to win\nmatches for India. There is no question of friendship. Kambli might\nbe my friend, but off the field. On the field, there are no friends.\nEveryone is playing for the country. Even a captain of a Club team\nwill pick the best side. There have been occasions when I have not\nplayed him in the eleven.'\nKambli has been in and out of the team a dozen times since his\ndebut. His last appearance was in Nairobi and Sharjah late in . In\nthe public eye, Sachin and Vinod are still closely associated. Their\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fjoint appearance in a Fiat Palio V commercial only reinforces that\nimage. Andwhile Tendulkar was going great guns in South Africa in\n, Kambli was busy acting in his first movie-as a 'villain'.\n(Tendulkar too has received movie offers, all of which he has politely\nand consistently turned down.)\nIt was manager Ajit Wadekar who took Kambli under his wing\nwhen he hit the purple patch in . The famous code of conduct\nwas drawn up to keep a rein on the players, and Kambli was made to\ntoe the line. Wadekar and Kambli enjoyed a special relationship. Both\nbeing left-handed and both being from Mumbai may have helped.\nWadekar was like an indulgent uncle keeping an eye on his wayward\nnephew. But today, ask Wadekar why Sachin zoomed ahead and Kambli\nhas only played  Tests till date, and the former manager will sum it\nup with one word: 'attitude'.\nJournalist Vijay Lokapally of the Hindu, who knows both Sachin\nand Vi nod well, told me that the 'real' Sachin could be seen only in the\npresence of his great pal. 'He is totally relaxed in Vinod's company.\nThere are plenty of jokes and leg-pulling. What struck me was that\neven at noisy and crowded functions when it is hard to hear anything,\nthe two would be conversing comfortably.'\n\nThe Great Friendship\n\nliS",
    "1994-1998": " I thought there was talent in Sachin.-Ajit Tendulkar\nHe scored his maiden first-class century on debut at ; his first Test\nton came when he was just . But the first person to 'bowl' to Sachin\nwas his nanny. Laxmibai Ghije used to throw a plastic ball at the\ntoddler, all of two and a halfyears, who would hit it back with a dhoka\n(washing stick). We used to go to the terrace and play. I was the first\nbowler he faced in his life,' the -year-old recalled in an interview to\nthe Vlleek ( November ).\nFor  years Sachin was under the care ofLaxmibai at the writers'\ncooperative housing society of Sahitya Sahawas (roughly translated,\nthe 'community oflitterateurs') in the middle-class suburb ofBandra\n(East). His father, Professor Ramesh Tendulkar, taught Marathi at\nMumbai's Kirti College, and mother Rajini worked with the Life\nInsurance Corporation oflndia (uc). Sachin was born on  April\n,  years after brother Ajit; sister Savita and brother Nitin were\nthe older siblings. His grandfather named him after the famous Hindi\nmusic composer, Sachin Dev Burman. Coincidentally, music would\nbe one of the adult Sachin's three passions, the other two being cricket\nand his family.\nNitin, Savita and Ajit were children from their father's first\nmarriage. When their mother passed away, Ramesh was left with three\nyoung children to bring up, and as is the custom in several parts of\nIndia, he married the sister ofhis late wife.\nThe family was not particularly sports oriented, with poetry and\nliterature being the abiding passions of father Ramesh, a gold medallist\n\n\fof Bombay University in both the BA and MA examinations. Nitin\ntook after his father and his initial interest in cricket was soon diverted\nto poetry. Aj it was the first in the family to seriously take to cricket; he\ncaptained his school team and also played in college and for various\nclub sides. Both today work for Air India, Nitin as a flight purser and\nAjit in reservations.\nIn the s and s, the live telecast of cricket and other sports, notably\nthe finals ofWimbledon, brought the superstars of the sporting world\ninto the homes oflndians who were starved of top quality international\nsports. The very year Sachin was born, the cricket-mad city ofMumbai\nfor the first time had the privilege ofwatching a Test match live on TV.\nIt was the fifth and final Test against the MCC (England) side led by\nTony Lewis and would be the final Test match to be played at the\nBrabourne Stadium. Ten years later India won the Prudential World\nCup in England-shown live in the country-beating twicechampions West Indies in the final against all odds. Sachin had reached\n'double figures' just two months before that epochal victory and was\npart of the new generation of youngsters fired by one oflndia' s greatest\nsporting achievements.\nSachin,judging from the memories ofhis childhood friends, was\na hyperactive child. An unusual mix of school-yard bully and sensitive\nsoul, he stood out among his friends even at a young age. Laxmibai\nrecalls his compassion as a little boy and his loyalty to his friends,\nwhich has stayed with him all his life. 'After coming home from school,\nhe used to have his milk very reluctantly on the staircase. At times he\nwould give the milk to Ramesh, his childhood friend. I used to feed\nhim while he played,' Laxmibai said in the  interview. And he\nalways insisted on two plates while eating--one for himself and another\nfor Ramesh, the son of the local watchman and his fast friend. Today\nRamesh is personal assistant to Ajit and Sachin.\nThe  buildings in the Sahitya Sahawas housing complex (the\nTendulkars' wing, where Ajit still lives with his mother, is called\n'Ushakkal') had by the standards of the crowded metropolis, a large\nplayground, all of yards by  yards. This for Sachin and his close\nBombay Boy\n\n\n\n\fcompanions constituted the great outdoors.\nHis brother Ajit recalls Sachin as a restless child who could never\nstay in one spot for long and was always running around. He had also\nan early interest in outdoor games.\nChildhood photos ofSachin show him with a mass of curly long\nhair, exuberant and playful. The early neighbourhood gang consisted\nof Avinash Gowariker (now a photographer) and Sunil Harshe (a\ncontractor) while Atul Ranade (Mumbai Ranji Trophy player) was a\nfriend from kindergarten. The most abiding memory of those\nchildhood days appears to be Sachin's strength and his fondness for\n'fights'. Whenever there was a new boy in the housing society or\nschool, Sachin would challenge him physically. He rarely came out\non the losing side.\nRanade's first glimpse ofSachin was in junior kindergarten. His\nlong hair had him initially mistaken for a girl. 'But it turned out to be\na boy and that too a very strong boy,' said Ranade in Outlook ( January\n).\nBy the time he reached the second grade, Sachin had achieved the\nnot inconsiderable feat for a six-year-old of beating up another boy all\nof two years older than him. 'Bashing them up for no reason' was his\nown unique way of getting his message across to his peer group,\naccording to Ranade. But he showed compassion too, though this\ntrait was reserved for animals. Gowariker summed up the paradox:\n'He was a very tender person. But he was always fascinated with power,\nspeed and things like that.'\nSachin's first sporting hero, though, was not a cricketer; it was\ntennis superstar John McEnroe. The  Wimbledon final between\nthe brash American and the cool Swede, Bjorn Borg, was the first to be\nshown live in India. It was the match that saw Borg's five-year reign\nbrought to an end in an epic final. Borg was the sentimental favourite\nall over the world, India included. But Sachin was rooting for the\nyounger man. McEnroe's victory in  spawned a mini 'Mac' in\nfaraway Bandra. Briefly, the child's fascination was for tennis. With\nracket in hand and the trademarks of the new Wimbledon championheadband and two wristbands, not to mention the curly hair-the\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fmakeover was complete. It was not long before his friends dubbed\nhim 'Mac'. Fortunately for Indian cricket, the fling with tennis did\nnot last, and before long Sachin had made it to the Sahitya Sahawas\n'big boys' cricket team.\nBy the time he was , Sachin's obsession with cricket had begun.\nEvery morning at  a.m., he would be at the nets in Shivaji Park.\nSachin's uncle and aunt, Suresh and Mangala Tendulkar, lived just\nacross the road from the park. Sachin would finish school\n(Sharadashram English, very close to Shivaji Park) in the morning\nand then go to his uncle's for lunch and a rest before crossing to\nShivaji Park for afternoon practice from  p.m. to  p.m. The kit\nwould be left dt his uncle's house, and with his school bag he would\nget home by  p.m. Studies and dinner followed and then a tired\nSachin would be in bed. But the commute from Bandra (East) to\nDadar (West) became too strenuous after a while and it was decided\nthat it would be better if he stayed on at his uncle's place. The\narrangement continued till he made his first-class debut in .\nIt was his brother Ajit who first spotted Sachin's natural talent.\nWhile Sachin imitated his heroes in other sports (notably, McEnroe),\nwhere cricket was concerned, he had a style of his own. Ajit noticed\nhis feel for the game and his ability to read the length of the ball. The\ntalent was most definitely there. And it struckf\\jit before anyone else.\nIndian cricket-indeed, the world of sports-owes a huge debt to Ajit\nTendulkar, for it was he who set the first small steps in motion.\nTo understand the rapid rise ofTendulkar from schoolboy cricketer\nto international star, you first have to understand the ethos and history\nofMumbai cricket. Mumbai has produced more Test cricketers and\nwon the Ranji Trophy on more occasions than any other city or state\nin India. When the mighty Sunil Gavaskar, first to reach , runs\nin Test cricket and scorer of most centuries () says, 'Whatever I am\nin the game today is due to the fact that I have been nursed in the\ncradle of cricket, that is Bombay,' it is no exaggeration. According to\nhim, the most intense clashes he ever took part in were India v Pakistan,\nMumbai v Delhi and Dadar Union v Shivaji Park Gymkhana.\nMumbai's proud record in the Ranji Trophy has faded from the\nBombay Boy\n\n\n\n\fglory days that lasted till the mid-s. Nor do its players these days\ndominate the ranks of the national team, as had traditionally been the\ncase since India made its international debut in . Indeed, there\nhave been occasions when Sachin Tendulkar was the sole\nrepresentative in the Test side from the city that boasts the proudest\ncricket tradition in the land. The North (particularly Delhi) and the\nSouth (particularly Karnataka) caught up with their western rival in\nthe mid-s. Before that Mumbai remained unbeaten from -\nto -, a golden streakof years unprecedented in the history of\nfirst-class cricket.\nTo understand the passion that is cricket, take a train to Mumbai.\nLook out of the window as you approach the city and you will see the\nevidence all around. On tiny strips ofland next to the tracks, on streets\nand in fields, wherever a little space can be squeezed out, boys of all\nages, often with the most rudimentary equipment, can be seen playing\ntheir hearts out from dawn to dusk. Veteran cricket journalist Pradeep\nVijayakar told me that this passion for cricket in his beloved city was\n'unquenchable': 'Ifl could afford to, I would be at the nets early in the\nmorning, play a match during the day and then coach in the evening.'\nThe 'Bombay school ofbatsmanship' is a tradition that has served\nIndian cricket well. It is founded on technical certitude and a ruthless\nstreak where the bowler is the enemy and occupation of the crease a\nkind of tunnel vision-a take-no-prisoners style of cricket. And the\nnames ofMumbai's great batsmen read like an honour scroll oflndian\ncricket-Vijay Merchant, Rusi Modi, Polly Umrigar, Nari Contractor,\nVijay Manjrekar, Dilip Sardesai, Ajit Wadekar, Sunil Gavaskar,\nSandeep Patil, Sanjay Manjrekar, down to the present generation of\nPravinAmre, Vinod Kambli and quite possibly the finest of them all,\nSachin Tendulkar.\nIt was on a beach not far from Mumbai, in the Gulf ofCambay, that\nthe very first game of cricket in India was played. Here, in , British\nsailors and traders whiling away their time during a fortnight's docking\nplayed the occasional game which attracted a smattering of local\ninterest. In , the Calcutta Cricket Club (now the Calcutta Cricket\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fand Football Club) was established, the second oldest cricket club in\nthe world after the MCC. Calcutta (now known as Kolkata) was then\nthe headquarters of the British East India Company. But the action\nsoon switched to Mumbai which witnessed its first match in ,\nthanks to the pioneering efforts of the city's tiny Parsi community,\nalso known as India's Hambledon (the birthplace of cricket) men.\nThe first club, the Oriental Cricket Club, was formed in  by\nwhich time the Parsis, who had fled Persia in the sixth century, had\nmade a reputation for themselves in virtually every field from business\nto sporting. They also followed several British customs and traditions,\nincluding the game of cricket.\nThe first team from India to tour England were the Pars is in .\nThough they could register just one win from  matches, the\npioneering steps had been .taken and two years later, there was a marked\nimprovement in their record when they toured again. Early enthusiasm\namong Mumbai's population for cricket was obvious in  when\nthe Parsis beat G.F. Vernon's team from England by four wickets,\nwatched by , spectators. After they had beaten two more sides\nfrom England, a biannual match between the Pars is and the Europeans\nwas instituted in . The Governor of Bombay Presidency, Lord\nHarris, a former MCC president and England Test captain, was one of\nthe early patrons oflndian cricket, and his name lives on in the Harris\nShield inter-school tournament in Mumbai in which Sachin first\nmade a name for himself.\nBy , the Hindus had joined the fray and the tournament grew\nto a triangular. By , it was termed as the Quadrangular with the\ninclusion of the Muslims, and then came the Pentangular with players\nfrom other communities (including Christians,Jains, Buddhists and\nJews) playing for The Rest. All these matches were played in Mumbai,\nbut eventually the league gave way to the Ranji Trophy after it received\nthe stamp of disapproval from none other than Mahatma Gandhi,\nwho considered anything practised along comm unallines anathema.\nThe bedrock ofMumbai cricket in the twentieth century was the\nKanga League which was established in  and which journalist\nR~deep Sardesai (son ofDilip Sardesai) described as the 'heart and\n\n\fsoul of Bombay cricket' (An Indian Cricket Omnibus, ed. Guha and\nVaidyanathan). Raj deep himself once carried his bat for  in a total of\n for Jolly Cricketers (for whom Ajit Tendulkar also turned out) in a\nKanga League match in . Every Mumbai cricketer from Merchant\nto Tendulkar has cut his teeth in the league which started with eight\nteams and today has  from division 'Pl. to 'G', attracting over \nplayers, umpires and scorers. The uniqueness of this tournament is\nthat it is played in Mumbai's monsoon season when the rain comes\ndown in unending torrents. 'Play forward on a wet pitch and you will\nend up with mud splattered on your face,' said Vljayakarwho proudly\nboasts of having claimed Tendulkar's wicket first ball in a club match\nwhen Sachin was  years old.\nMany veterans ascribe the decline ofMumbai's cricketing fortunes\nto the reluctance oftoday's players to participate on pitches which are\nso unpredictable in bounce. 'The top players fear playing on wet\ntracks ... that is why Mumbai's batting standards have dropped. The\nstandards were high because the Kanga League helped them tighten\ntheir techniques,' former India opener and Mumhai captain Sudhir\nNaik told Clayton Murzello in an interview in Sunday Mid Day (\nJuly ).\nThe league attracts intense team loyalty. Former Test batsman\nMadhav Apte Golly Cricketers) is still active at , having played\nevery year since the team's inception. Another player, wicketkeeper\nMehli Dinshaw Irani who played in the Ranji Trophy, also turned out\nfor his side (Parsi Cyclists) for more than  years. In his essay 'Come\nRain or Shine' (An Indian Cricket Omnibus), Rajdeep Sardesai reports\nhis  conversation with Irani: 'If you can play one hour on a rainaffected wicket, then you can play anywhere. Yet, I find that today's\nyoungsters prefer going to England during the summer. Compared\nto the Kanga League, English cricket is like a friendly village green.' A\nmajor incentive for young cricketers in the league is the hope of seeing\ntheir names in the next morning's papers. This is their reward for\nscores of and above, and bowling figures of three or more wickets.\nFormer Test umpire Piloo Reporter has been standing in local\nmatches for  years. In the same article in Sunday Mid Day, he recollects,\nI\n\nSachin\n\n\f'Several years ago, I was standing at square leg, umpiring a game at\nAzad Maidan. The batsman struck the ball to midwicket and the\nbatsmen ran a couple. I was watching the batsman make his ground.\nAs the wicketkeeper collected the ball, the batsman complained,\n\"Umpire, yeh apna ball nahin hai'' (Umpire, this is not our ball). He was\nright, a fielder from an adjoining match had thrown the ball which\nthe wicketkeeper gobbled up!'\nNothing can prepare a first-time visitor for the shock of seeing a\ndozen games being played simultaneously on the chock-a-bloc Azad\nand Cross Maidans. Nowhere in the world will you sec organized\ncricket in which a fielder seemingly at mid-wicket is actually positioned\nat fine leg for his own team.\nIn Sandeep Bamzai's book Gavaskar and Tendulkar: Shaping Indian\nCricket's Destiny, the flamboyant former Test batsman Sandeep Patil\npropounded the theory of two schools of batsmanship within the\n'Bombay school ofbatsmanship': Dadar Union and Shivaji Park. Patil,\nwhose father Madhu also played in the Ranji 'Irophy for Mumbai\n(and who agreed with his son's theory), reckoned that Dadar Union\nbatsmen exhibited technical exactitude, while the more devastating\nversion incorporating elan, panache and flamboyance was on show at\nShivaji Park Gymkhana. Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar and Sanjay\nManjrekar played for Dadar Union, while Vijay Manjrekar, Ajit\nWadekar and Sandeep Patil represented Shivaji Park Gymkhana.\nWhile the Kanga League is played every Sunday during the\nmonsoon season, the Times Shield (founded by the Times ciflndia) is\nthe inter-office league played during the winter, which attracts an\nequal number of international and first-class players. The city's\ncricketing structure is completed by the Harris Shield for boys under\n and the Giles Shield (under ) inter-school tournaments, ensuring\nthat cricket is played almost all the year round. And competition is\nfierce at every level.\nMumbai has often been described as Indian cricket's Yorkshire.\nBut just as West Indian cricket fans preferred to refer to Sir Don\nBradman as the 'White Headley' (as against George Headley's popular\nBombay Boy\n\nII\n\n\fsobriquet, 'The Black Bradman'), diehard Mumbaikars would no doubt\nconsider Yorkshire English cricket's Mumbai.\n\n\n\nSachin\n Musical Chairs\n\nHe has played me better than anybody.-Shane Warne\nThe third ODI against Sri Lanka at Margao on  December  was\nSachin Tendulkar's last in charge before he was sacked on January.\nIndia lost the match by five wickets and there were rumours that the\ncaptain had asked to be relieved ofhis duties. The disastrous Sharjah\ntournament was played in between the Test and the three-match ODI\nseries against the Sri Lankans at home. The defeat meant Tendulkar\nhad lost  of the  oms in which he had led since taking over in\nAugust . Only  were won, five were abandoned, and one was\ntied.\nHis batting record in the  matches was below par- runs at\nthe average of, with four s and ten s. In  Test matches as\ncaptain, he had  runs at . , with four OOs and four s. There\nwere three wins, four defeats and ten draws in these Tests. The figures\nsuggest that while his Test performance remained largely unaffected,\nhis batting in oms had suffered to some extent. Harsha Bhogle had\nthis to say in the Spottstar ( October ), nearly three months\nbefore Tendulkar's sacking: 'It is not the number of runs that he has\nscored, or hasn't, that causes as much concern as the personality he\nseems to project now. Tendulkar could always punish good ball and\nbad alike and offer more than one shot to a ball. He demolished\nbowlers, he didn't kill them softly. Today he seems to stumble\nmomentarily in the gulf that has ruined the best; in that hrief moment\nwhere he asks himself, \"should I or shouldn't I?\"'\n\n\fOf equal concern to genuine cricket fans was the change in\nappearance that Bhogle pointed out. 'Tertdulkar had a carefree boyish\nlook to him two years ago. Today, he seems a worried man. Look at a\nphotograph of him then and place it alongside one of today's and you\nwill see two different men.' Tendulkarwas interviewed by the Telegraph\n() and asked ifitwas easier not being captain. 'Let's say you have\nmore time, or well, all the time to think about your own game. Perhaps\nas captain, I didn't get the time to think about my own game. I kept\nthinking about everybody else. I'm not complaining, still.. .. ' As for\nhis first reaction to the sacking: 'Initially, yes, I was upset. But those\nfirst few days I fell back on my family.'\nThe reinstatement ofAzhar was not the first instance of its kind in\nIndian cricket. The circumstances, though, were certainly unusual,\nfor the BCCI officials had,just a few weeks before his reappointment,\nsaid they would be giving him a dressing down for his irresponsible\nbatting in Sha~jah.\nRamakant Desai dismissed all talk ofTendulkar having tendered\nhis resignation. He said: 'We removed Tendulkar because he could\nnot take the pressure ofboth batting and captaincy.' This is something\nTendulkar and his supporters have always denied.\nPrem Panicker of Rediffcom was ruthless in his criticism of the\nselectors in an article published on  January , the day of the\ndrama (which came to be called 'musical chairs').

Courtesy: The New Indian\nExpress\n\n\falarmingly contradictory face oflndian cricket is first on that\nlist.\nConsider recent history. Mter a dream run leading India in\nTests and one dayers on home soil, the first cracks appear in\nAzharuddin's captaincy when, flying in the face of perceived\nwisdom, he wins the toss and opts to bat second against Sri\nLanka in the World Cup semifinal at the Eden Gardens,\nCalcutta. The clearly underprepared track crumbles and Sanath\nJayasuriya has India in a spin, leading to a riot and the\nabandonment of the game, which is awarded to Sri Lanka by\nmatch referee Clive Lloyd.\nThe cracks widen during India's disastrous tour of England.\nThe team stumbles from one bad performance to another,\nNavjot Singh Sihu adds controversy to confusion when he\nabandons the tour, media reports and, indeed, the report of the\ntour manager speak of a disinterested captain who has totally\ncut himself offfrom the rest of the team and spends all his time\nwith his inamorata.\nIronically, at that point in time, Azhar has really done little\nwrong. The defeat in England owed to factors other than the\ncaptaincy-the cold weather told on the bowlers, especially the\nspinners; batsmen found their fingers cramping, fielders\nlumbered around in clothing more suited to an arctic\nexpedition ....\nl.ook hack at that tour, and you realise that as the biting cold of\nwinter eased towards the end of the tour, both batsmen and\nbowlers began performing a lot better-though the\nimprovement came too late to do any good in terms of overall\nresults.\nThe team returns. And Azharuddin is sacked. The selectors\nreplace him with Sachin Tendulkar-and the nation goes into\ncollective frenzy, expecting the master batsman to produce\nmiracles. Sachin for his part records fine wins over Australia\nand South Africa in Tests at home, then leads the team to the\nTitan Cup ODI triangular against the same opponents, before\nMusical Chairs\n\n\n\n\ftaking off to South Mrica where the team is caught on the\nbackfoot on the fastest wicket in the world, and goes down -\nbefore it can even catch its collective breath. From there on, it is\nall downhill, till the third Test, when India's bid for victory is\nthwarted by a combination of rain and what can best be described\nas 'patriotic' ground staff.\nAgain, after a bad start, India storms into the final of the SBI\nODI series-and an exciting run chase made more difficult by\nrain and a consequent readjustment of the target later-lose,\nbut emerge the real heroes for a brilliant performance.\nFrom there to the West Indies-and an eminently forgettable\nperformance by the team. And in retrospect, it is here that\nTendulkar's troubles with the selectors begin. Ahead of the tour,\nhe asks for an off spinner to combat the Windies array oflefthanders. The request is turned down by selectors on the grounds\nthat there are no off spinners of quality in India (never mind\nthat the same bunch, later, rediscovered Rajesh Chauhan).\nTendulkar protests. Protests again when the totally unknown\nNoel David is flown over after Srinath breaks down.\nHis protests, for the first time, lead the selectors to realise that\nhe is no rubber stamp, to meekly toe the line.\nMeanwhile, master batsman Mohammad Azharuddin slides.\nBadly. Initially it is seen as loss ofform. Then, as the run outs\nmount, as instances of his over-ruling the captain's instructions\nsurface (for instance, in the St Vincent's one dayer), the\ngroundswell of opinion turns against him.\nHe is dropped from the Indian side to play the Independence\nCup quadrangular. And the selectors-the same bunch, mind\nyou, who are doing duty right now-explain that it is his lack\nof commitment, his apparent disinterest in the game, that has\nled to his ouster.\nReinstated for the Asia Cup and the Test series in Sri Lanka,\nAzharuddin comes good with the bat.\nAt this point, a section of the selectors openly come out in\nfavour of the sacking of Tendulkar and reinstatement of\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fAzharuddin as India's captain. The timing is important, herethis is bifore Toronto. At this point, Sachin Tendulkar is doing\nvery well with the bat. And yet, sections of the media carry on\nthe inspired campaign-that Tendulkar is feeling the pressure\nof captaincy, that his batting is falling apart, that India's losses\nare attributable to this factor and this factor alone.\nThe five game Sahara Cup in Toronto sees Azhar still in fine\ntouch-while Tendulkar hits a bad patch. Pakistan, and the\nthree oms for the Jinnah Cup, and Azhar is still doing okay, if a\nshade under the form he showed in Sri Lanka and Canada.\nHowever, the selectors, who have been making a case for the\nsacking of Tendulkar, fail to muster a majority within the\ncommittee. Further, the - win record in eight games on the\ntrot against Pakistan make it rather embarrassing, for them, to\ntalk of the sacking of the skipper. And board president Raj Singh\nDungarpur steps in to read the riot act, and indicate firmly that\nTendulkar should not be tampered with.\nThen comes Sharjah-and a performance from Azharuddin\nthat is so downright shocking that international television\ncommentators of the order of Geoffrey Boycott and Mark\nNichols comment adversely. Sunil Gavaskar, also on live\ntelevision, is scathing. The media reports are uniformly\ncondemnatory.\nAnd as Mohammad Azharuddin gets run out-in a fashion\nthat would discredit a novice-in the key game against Pakistan,\na section of fans at the ground hold up a banner that sums up\nthe collective mood. 'Manoj Prabhakar, you are right!', reads\nthe banner, referring to the former all-rounder's allegations of\nbribery and match-fixing within the Indian squad.\nThe national selectors, shaken by the storm, summon\nAzharuddin to a closed door meeting. And at the end of it,\nRamakant Desai, chairman of selectors, announces that he has\nbeen reprimanded, and pardoned.\nBoard secretary J aywant Lele, who was in Sharjah at the time\nof the selection committee meeting in question, announces on\nMusical Chairs\n\n\n\n\fhis return that he believes Azharuddin should have been sacked.\nSaying that he was basing his views on the evidence of having\nseen Azhar play, at first hand, in Sharjah, Lele says, 'The national\nselectors should have shown more courage and dropped\nAzharuddin. Reputations should not count, only performance\nshould be the criterion ... .'\nFollows three more oms, against Sri Lanka. Azhar's bad run\nof form continues.\nAt the end of it, Azharuddin is made captain oflndia!\nNot just for the three-nation tournament in Bangladesh\nbeginningJanuary . But also for the three Test series against\nAustralia to follow. And for the triangular ODI tournament after\nthat.\nContrast this with Sachin Tendulkar, who was recently\nappointed 'captain for  days.'\nLele is totally, completely silent.\nSo, interestingly, is Ramakant Desai, chairman of selectors,\nwho stumbles in the face of acerbic, at times angry, questioning\nby the media at the press briefing after the selection committee\nmeeting in Bombay on Friday.\nDesai opens his account in style, by saying 'There was no predetermined move to sack Tendulkar. All five selectors felt it\nwould be a great disservice to Indian cricket if he continued his\nlean trot in one dayers because of the extra burden of captaincy.'\nNo pre-determined move? When, both before and after the\nAsia Cup, two selectors have systematically, under the guise of\nanonymity (the heck with the no names policy-the two\nselectors in question are Sambaran Bannerjee and Shivlal\nYadav) spoken to the media about their determination to sack\nTendulkar? No 'pre-determination'? When the board president,\nthen in London, is constrained to telephone the national\nselectors ahead of the Sharjah tournament to insist that they do\nnot sack Tendulkar? No 'pre-determination'? When national\nnews magazine The Week carries a cover story, quoting a\nnational selector and an unnamed Beer official as saying that\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthere was a move, with sanction from a section of the board, to\nsack Tendulkar? And when the same magazine, and others,\nopenly allege that a cartel of bookmakers, unable to make any\nheadway with Tendulkar, have begun exerting monetary\ninfluence on the selectors to axe him?\nThe 'no pre-determination' number by Desai is flayed by the\nmedia. A volley of questions follow. Desai subsides into silence.\nFinding him lost for answers, his colleague, Kishen Rungta,\nsteps into the breach. And comes up with some of the best\nspecimens of double-talk seen in living memory. We present\nsamples:\n'The reason why the selectors fell back on Azharuddin was\nthat he was the only player, other than Tendulkar, to be a\ncertainty in both forms of the game .... '\nOh really? Granted that Rahul Dravid has been droppednever mind, for now. the wisdom or lack thereof of that particular\nmove-how about Sourav Ganguly, to name just another\ncertainty? Again, wasn't this the same bunch of selectors who,\njust a while ago, spoke of having one captain-Ajay Jadejafor one-dayers and another for Tests? So why does the captain\nfor Bangladesh have to be a certainty in 'both forms of the\ngame'?\nNo reply.\nWasn't Azharuddin originally dropped because he was seen\nto be an unimaginative captain? No, says Kishen Rungta. 'He\nwas sacked due to a turbulent period in his personal life. He\nhad remained tense and preoccupied, which showed in his\nleadership. He is now settled back as a family man, married to\nMiss BijJani, he has got an amicable divorce from his first wife\nand his parents have also accepted him,' is Rungta's reasoning.\nIn other words, the most essential qualification for becoming\ncaptain oflndia is a happy married life. Which, of course, rules\nout the bachelor boys, Dravid,Jadeja eta!. But last we heard,\nSachin Tendulkar was perfectly happy with wife Anjali and\nnewborn daughter Sara. And Ganguly, to cite another name,\nMusical Chairs\n\n\n\n\fwas very happy with wife Dona. Or do the selectors know\nsomething about the personal lives of these players that the rest\no(usdon't?\nWas there any doubt aboutAzhar's commitment to the side?\nOf course not, says Rungta. Then why was he summoned to\nthe selectors' meeting, ahead of the Sharjah tour? 'We simply\nwanted to give him a pep talk, to boost his spirits which seemed\nlow after so many negative things were written and spoken\nabout him in the media and on television.'\nThere was no question of his ability and his sincerity? 'No,\nthat was never in doubt by any of us!'\nThe statement is a downright lie.\n'Azharuddin was pardoned,' Desai told the press at the end of\nthe meeting on December . The members of the national\npress were present. The words were quoted, verbatim, in all\nmedia reports the last day.\nHowever, there is more still. Asked why Tendulkar was sacked,\nRungta on behalf of Desai said that the only criterion was bad\nbatting, and not any perceived defects in the captaincy.\nIf that is the case, then why is Tendulkar not captain of the\nTest side, considering that he is aggregating over , runs,\nand averaging over , in Tests this year-the highest of any of\nthe Indian batsmen?\nNo reply.\nBut more of the same. We wanted to make a last ditch effort to\navoid the unpleasant step of axing Tendulkar, so we asked him\nto bat lower down in one dayers. This, however, failed to produce\nany extraordinary results, he got only two -plus scores in six\ninnings, so we were forced to take this step.'\nSo the selectors determine these things on the basis of runs\nscored. Interesting.\nNow examine the facts. The selectors ask Tendulkar to bat\nlower down. He does so, in six matches. His sequence of scores,\nbeginning with Sharjah, are as follows: Versus England,  off\n deliveries. Versus West Indies,  off. Versus Pakistan,  off\n\n\nSachin\n\n\f. Versus Sri Lanka in the first om,  off . Second om,\nabandoned. Third om,  off. And one of those innings, the\n off undefeated, is a match-winner.\nCompare Azharuddin's sequence, in the same period, in the\nsame order:  otT,  otiS,  otT , not out otT , otT.\nIn fact, against Sri Lanka, Azhar is ranked below Tendulkar,\nwho tops with , Ganguly (),Jadeja () and Sidhu (),\nwith  runs to his name. In other words, Azharuddin, whose\nform and commitment are not in doubt by the selectors, ranks\nlast among the  specialist batsmen in the side.\nTherefore, he-deservedly, in the opinion of the national\nselectors-gets to lead the side. Because for the selectors, statistics\nare not a beacon light but a crutch-to be used, selectively,\nwhen they do not have a logical leg to stand on.\nIt is not my intention here to belittle the achievements of\nAzharuddin-who, by any yardstick, deserves to be ranked\namong the top five batsmen India has produced in\ncontemporary (even, perhaps, in all time) history. In fact, a\nlook through our own archives will indicate that at the\nconclusion of the England tour of , when there was a\ncollective demand for his head, Rediffconsistently argued that\nhis personal life should not be the yardstick used to judge him,\nthat the team failure in England was collective and could not\nbe laid at the door of the captain alone, and that it was bad\npolicy to sack him at that point.\nHowever, applying the same yardstick, we maintain that it is\neven worse policy to reappoint him now. His form is suspect,\nhis commitment even more so (Rungta notwithstanding, do\nkeep in mind the selectors' move in calling him for a 'reprimand\nand pardon'). If captaincy can have a negative impact on Sachin\nTendulkar, how much more then, by the same logic, could it\nimpact on an already struggling Azharuddin? Wherein lies the\nlogic, here?\nMeanwhile Desai, once the storm of questioning about the\nappointment of Azhar subsides, takes over from Rungta to\nMusical Chairs\n\n\n\n\fmouth an extempore elegy to Sachin Tendulkar. Samples:\n~I of us have tremendous respect for Tendulkar, and not since\nGavaskar has anyone received so much admiration from all as\nTendulkar has got. But unfortunately, the selectors could not\ncome to any other conclusion for his batting failures in onedayers, except that it was due to the 'problem of captaincy.'\nInteresting. How then do they account for the fact that\nTendulkar's average in Tests this year is higher than his lifetime\naverage? The 'problem of captaincy' adversely affects a player\nwhen he is playing one-day cricket, and beneficially when he\nis playing Test cricket?\nMore from Desai: 'The selectors have gone on record\nappreciating Tendulkar's sportsmanship of taking all the blame\non himsel\u00a3 He is the type to carry on the battle. Very few captains\nput their head on the block as he did, but we want him more as\nrun-scorer than as captain.'\nAnd-as television anchors are so fond of saying-with this,\nwe come to the end oftoday's programme. The next installment\nwill be brought to you on Saturday, when the national selectors\nmeet to finalise the team for Dacca.\nTailpiece: Two peripheral issues need passing mention, here.\nOn Friday, the national selectors unveiled their latest theory to\nexplain why Sachin had done badly as captain, and why\nAzharuddin was doing badly as a batsman. 'The media has\nbeen writing irresponsibly, and putting pressure on the team,'\nsays Desai.\nRight. The media chopped and changed teams at will. The\nmedia held a gun to Tendulkar's head and asked him to bat at\nnumber four (interestingly, Desai before the Sri Lanka series\nvehemently denied that the selectors had asked Tendulkar to\nbat lower down, and said that was a media-propagated lie; today,\nRungta confirms that the selectors had indeed done so in a 'last\nditch attempt' to avoid sacking him-so who is lying, here?).\nThe media consistently refused to give Tendulkar the team he\nasked for. The media dictated that Prasad should not play in\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fcertain games. The media dropped Dravid. The media got\nAzharuddin run out with some bad calling .... and so on ....\nRight on, Mr Desai!\nMeanwhile, was Sachin sacked, or did he quit? The last \nhours have brought a spate of denials. From Desai, from Lele,\nfrom Shivlal Yadav. Every denial is couched in the same way...\n'No, we have not officially been informed of Tendulkar's\nresignation .... '\nNice. The media reports, since denied with extreme heat, were\nspecific. They said in so many words that after the third ODI\nagainst Sri Lanka, Tenduikar has told the selectors that he would\nlike to step down. He did not put it in writing, to 'whomsoever\nit may concern'. And so the Beer establishment kept harping\non not having been informed 'officially'.\nThe most illuminating statement on this issue comes from\nDesai. 'It is true that for some time now we have been debating\na change in captaincy. However, it must be made clear that any\ndecision on the matter will be our own decision, and not\nTendulkar's.'\nIn other words-'Sorry, Sachin, you can't quit, because we\nwant to sack you!'\nBy the way, friend Desai, when he said on Thursday that 'it is\ntrue we have been debating a change in captaincy,' could not\nforesee, poor chap, that  hours later, he would inform the\npress at the briefing that there was 'no pre-determination about\nthe move to change captains'.\nThere was to be a tragic footnote to Desai's travails at the hands of\nhis fellow selectors and the media. Two months after Tendulkar's\nsacking, he resigned on health grounds. A month later he was dead, at\n.\nFor Indian cricket, on its sickbed throughout , the new year would\nbe one of robust health as it went on a title-winning spree. And for the\nex-captain, who would celebrate his twenty-fifth birthday in April, it\nMusical Chairs\n\n\n\n\fwas perhaps his annus mirabilis. Whether this was a result \u00b7of the\nunburdening of the heavy baggage that the captaincy entailed, is open\nto debate. But there is no doubt that in  he was back to 'demolishing'\nbowlers.\nThere appeared to be twin benefits to Indian cricket with the change\nat the top. Tendulkar was back to his best in one-day games while\nAzharuddin's added responsibilities appeared to bring out the best in\nhim again. At Dhaka in January , the Indians recorded the most\namazing run chase in nearly  years of one-day cricket. The occasion\nwas Bangladesh's somewhat belated Silver Jubilee Independence Cup\nin January. Both the captain and the ex-captain had an outstanding\ntournament and combined to beat the hosts in the opening match.\nWith Bangladesh playing against India and Pakistan, there was little\ndoubt about who would contest the best-of-three finals. It was the\noutcome that would be a surprise.\nAfter their century stand in the first match, Azhar and Tendulkar\nwere once again involved in a big stand as India beat Pakistan by \nruns in the preliminary game. Azhar was Man of the Match for his\n. But it was Tendulkar who made it a match to remember. His\nfiftieth score of -plus (he made ) was smashed from  balls as the\ntwo raced to a stand worth  from just  overs, taking India to \nfor  from   overs (the match was shortened by fog).\nPakistan's hopes rested on Inzamam-ul-Haq. Their top scorer with\n, he was caught and bowled by Tendulkar-his fiftieth ODI wicket.\nSachin also held three more catches to round off a sparkling all-round\ndisplay. India took their form into the first final, coasting home by\neight wickets with nine overs to spare. Once again,Tendulkar was in\nthe thick of things. He had bowling figures of--- and then he\nput the Pakistani bowlers to the sword with  runs from  balls,\nwith five sixes and six fours. In this innings he became the youngest to\nmake   runs. His opening stand of  from  overs with\nGanguly made the task of chasing  for victory an easy one.\nCoach Anshuman Gaekwad had given Navjot Singh Sidhu the\ntask of attacking off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq. But Tendulkar would\nhave none of it. Though Saqlain was the most successful bowler of\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe tournament, Tendulkar went a,fter him with a vengeance. In the\nsecond final, when he was bowled in the second over by Azhar\nMahmood for , the batting folded up for  and Pakistan wrapped it\nup easily to take the tournament to the decider.\nThere too, it appeared to be Pakistan all the way as Saeed Anwar\nand Ijaz Ahmed went after the bowling and helped amass  for \nfrom  overs. The target seemed out oflndia's reach, though they\nwere given a flying start with Tendulkar smashing  from  balls.\nAzhar gambled by promoting Robin Singh as the pinch hitter.\nAmazingly, the ploy worked. Amazing because it had been tried by\nTendulkar a month earlier at Sharjah against Pakistan. Robin had got\nout first ball on that occasion and the captain faced the flak for his\ndecision. This time, the left-hander stayed long enough to score  in\na stand of  runs from . overs with centurion Ganguly. That\ntook the score to  for  in  overs and now the chase was on, with\nten overs remaining. Six Indian wickets tumbled in the gathering\ngloom. The winning hit came from the penultimate ball and the\nworld record for the highest winning total and the title was India's.\n(Australia would go on to equal and then break the record.) Ganguly\nwas Man of the Match for his superb  while Tendulkar took the\nMan of the Series award.\nTendulkar has pointed out in subsequent interviews how the\ncaptaincy can hinge on decisions like the promotion of Robin Singh\ncoming off or not. That was not the only irony of the final match. At\n for  in . overs, the umpires and the Pakistanis left the field\nwith the light fading fast. But skipper Azhar stood his ground. India\nwould have lost if the match had been called off at that stage as they\nneeded  in  overs. But the match referee persuaded the umpires\nto continue the match which was then played with the floodlights\nswitched on. This was before the National Stadium was equipped\nwith floodlights for cricket. The lights the Indians played under were\ntneant for football. And the match referee was a gentleman by the\nname of Mike Denness, the former England captain who would play\na rnajor role in Indian cricket three years later. One of the keys to the\nteam's success was the restoration ofTendulkar to the opening slot.\nMusical Chairs\n\n\n\n\fThe new captain had been very particular about it and the selectors\nhad had to acquiesce.\nThe visit of the Australian team to India a month later was keenly\nanticipated. While India went without a Test win in , Australia\nwere sweeping all before them. Their record since - had elevated\nthem to the status of undisputed world champions. It was  years\nsince the Aussies had been in India for a full series. In  there was\nthe one-off Test on an under-prepared pitch in Delhi which India\neasily won. But Shane Warne was injured and not on that trip. This\ntime too, their bowling would be weakened in the absence of Glenn\nMcGrath and Jason Gillespie, with Paul Reiffel fit only for the first\nTest. The focus was on Warne who had come a long way since his\ndisastrous debut series against the Indians in Australia in -. He\nwas now considered the greatest bowler in the world, just as the tag of\ngreatest batsman rested on Sachin's shoulders. Their duel would be\nthe battle within the bigger battle and its outcome was expected to tilt\nthe series one way or the other.\nBefore the series, Tendulkar's preparations consisted ofgettingsome\nlocal leg-spinners to bowl to him on a pitch where the area outside the\nleg stump had deliberately been roughened. The practice held him in\ngood stead. The tourists' opening match was against Ranji Trophy\nchampions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium. Led by Tendulkar,\nthey inflicted a crushing ten-wicket defeat on the Aussies and the\ncaptain's own contribution set the tone for the series. In a decade of\nfirst-class cricket, Tendulkar had not come close to a double century.\nThat would change now as he went after Warne to put the visitors on\nthe back foot at the very start of their campaign.\nAustralia declared at  for  in their first innings. The fireworks\ncame after that. Warne had figures of ---, his worst in firstclass cricket. Tcndulkar was  not out, his best in first-class cricket.\nM umbai declared on  tor  and a demoralized Australia crumbled\nto  in their second innings to go down by ten wickets. From the\nIndian team's point ofview and from endulkar's too, this pertormance\nwas vital. It put a scare into the Aussie camp and it was downhill all the\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fway for them after that. Warne was hit for  runs in his first two overs.\nTendulkar reached his first  from  balls and his century came\nfrom  with  fours and a six. By the time he declared, Tendulkar\nwas on , scored in  minutes from  balls, with  fours and\ntwo sixes. The first bout against Warne had ended in a knockout.\nLess than ten days later, it was time for the real thing-the first Test\nat Chennai. Once again, Tendulkar employed the rough-outsidethe-leg-stump tactics at the Chennai nets. This time, though, he had\nbowlers of the calibre ofKumble and L.Sivaramakrishnan bowling to\nhim.\nIndia won the toss and took first strike. Openers Mongia and Sidhu\ngave them an excellent start with a stand of . But the innings fell\naway after that and  was a disappointing total. Warne picked up\nfour wickets and the prize one was that of the master himself. In the\nspace of five balls, the full house at Chepauk first roared with delight\nand then was stunned into silence. All the Warne v Tendulkar hype\nhad obviously got to Sachin. The first ball was smashed past the bowler.\nThe fifth dipped as he rushed the bowler and turned just enough to\ntake the edge of his flailing bat. The ball flew to Taylor's right at slip\nand the captain clung to it as if his life depended on it. The Aussies\nwere naturally cock-a-hoop. Tendulkar had been too hasty in trying\nto assert his authority over Warne and had paid the price_. Australia\nhad a first innings lead of. But they were to bat last on a spinning\ntrack and it wasn't enough. India piled up  for  declared in their\nsecond knock and then ran through the unofficial world champions,\nto come out winners by the convincing margin of  runs.\nTendulkar walked to the wicket half an hour into the fourth Jay,\nwith the score on  tor , after Sidhu had softened up the bowlers\nwith a hard-hitting . His ability to find the smallest gaps in the field\nallied with the power of his shots resulted in an unforgettJble innings\nof not out-the only century of the Test. It was the fifteenth of his\ncareer, in his fifty-second Test. By now the pitch was wearing rapiJly\nand Warne would no doubt have been in his element against any team\nexcept India at home, and any batsman except Tendulkar.\nSachin's two previous tons against Australia in the - series,\nMusical Chairs\n\n\n\n\fat Sydney and Perth, had only contributed to a draw and a heavy\ndefeat. This time it played a crucial part in India's victory. 'Taking into\naccount the pitch conditions and the fact that he was facing arguably\nthe best wrist spinner of them all, Tendulkar's -ball innings was\none of the greatest batting exhibitions of modern times,' wrote OJ\nRutnagur in Wisden Cricket Monthly (May ).\nWarne was reduced to desperation by Tendulkar's uncanny\njudgement of the direction and degree of spin from the bowler's hand.\nLeg-spinners pitching on the stumps were left alone, while a googly\nwas read early and ruthlessly disposed of. To make things worse for\nthe bowler, his flipper wasn't working either. All those hours spent\nplaying against the leggies in the 'nets', pitching in the rough, now\npaid off for Tendulkar. Bowling round the wicket, Warne pushed\nDravid into his shell. But Tendulkar was determined not to allow the\nbowler to gain the upper hand in their absotbing personal duel.\nBatsmen around the world for many years had floundered against the\nleg-spinner pitched on the rough on a turning wicket. But the Indian\nmaster was made of sterner stuff. He smashed the ball over midwicket,\nhad a narrow escape-then did it again. The calculated risk had come\noff splendidly and now he was unstoppable. The Aussie bubble had\nbeen burst and from then on an Indian victory was almost inevitable.\nSo was Sachin's Man of the Match award.\nThe first Test had been a contest till Australia's last-day capitulation.\nThe second at Kolkata turned out to be a rout, the visitors suffering\none of their biggest defeats of all time. India's  for  declared was\ntheir highest against Australia and the biggest total by any side at\nEden Gardens. Australia crumbled to  and  and were crushed\nby an innings and  runs. This time it was the captain who played\nthe leading hand with the bat. Azhar's  not out was his fifth in\nseven Tests at Kolkata. Laxman, Sidhu and Dravid all came close, but\nfell short of their tons. Once again, Tendulkar was in a murderous\nmood and once again Warne was his main target. He reached his \nfrom  balls and hit  fours and two sixes before playing an impetuous\nshot to be out for .\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fIndia maintained their mastery on their own soil. The Australians\nadmitted that India at home was their biggest challenge. The series\nwas decided, and Azharuddin held the Border-Gavaskar Trophy that\nIndia had first won in .\nAustralia salvaged some of their wounded pride by claiming the\n'dead' third Test at Bangalore by eight wickets. It was a case of too little\ntoo late, and once again Tendulkar proved he was peerless, with a\nsparkling . It was the sixth time in  centuries that he had crossed\n and the double ton would have been his but for a rush ofblood. A\nmeasure of his domination was that he scored  out of a total of\nmade while he was at the crease, and struck an extraordinary \nboundaries plus three sixes.\nThere could only be one candidate for the Man of the Series.\nIn his autobiography published three years later, Warne admitted\nthat Tendulkar had had the best of their exchanges during the series.\nHis immaculate footwork and his confidence to go for his strokes\nwere admirable, and bowling to him was actually a pleasure, said\nWarne.\nTendulkar carried his form against the Aussies into the Pepsi tri-nation\none-day series, where Zimbabwe joined the two teams. The surprise\ncame in the opening match at Kochi which India won by  runs.\nThis time Tendulkar won his customary Man of the Match award for\nhis success, not with the bat but with the ball-a first for him. The\nhuge Indian total of for  was built around Ajay Jadeja's  not\nout.\nThe challenge was taken up by the Australians who started off\nwith an opening stand of . They lost three quick wickets after that\nbefore captain Steve Waugh and Michael Bevan put them back on\ntrack with a partnership that threatened to take the game away from\nIndia. Azhar introduced Tendulkar into the attack more out of\ncompulsion than anything else. He made an immediate impact and\nslowed the run tlow in tandem with Kumble. Mixing up his slow\nmedium-pacers with leg breaks, he foxed Waugh with a slower one\nMusical Chairs\n\n\n\n\fand the ball was gently tapped back into the bowler's hands. Next, he\nhad Darren Lehmann plumb lbw for eight. Bevan and Tom Moody\nstruck a flurry ofboundaries before Bevan stepped out to Tendulkar in\na bid to increase the run rate. He was stumped by Mongia for  and\nwas followed by Moody, also stumped, from the first ball ofTendulkar's\nnext over to put him on a hat-trick. He almost got it when Damien\nMartyn hit the balljustwide of the bowler. From  for , the batting\nhad crumbled to  for  in  overs. Tendulkar got his first fivewicket haul when Martyn was caught at deep mid-off. Australia were\nsoon all out for . Tendulkar's analysis was ---, beating his\nprevious best of - against the West Indies at Sharjah in . 'I am\nmyself surprised by this show,' he said later, at the awards presentation.\nNot so surprising was another Tendulkar ton in the Kanpur game\nagainst the hapless Australians, who must have been sick and tired of\nthe sight ofhis broad bat by now. The Australian total of for  was\nmade to look insignificant by an opening stand of  between\nGanguly and the century-maker. But the Green Park track was not an\neasy batting surface; the ball turned and kept low. Tendulkar decided\nthe best way would be to get to the pitch of the ball and go for the\nbowling if India had to qualify for the final. He did just that, with\ndevastating effect. His seven sixes (plus five fours) were an Indian\nrecord, beating the six sixes hit by Kapil Dev against Zimbabwe in the\n World Cup. The innings took just  balls. Waugh admitted that\nhis bowlers could do little with the batsman in such brilliant form.\n'He played a great innings,' he conceded.\nAustralia won two and lost two of their league matches, India won\nall four, while the Zimbabweans were gallant in defeat, losing all four\nby narrow margins. The victory in the final for Australia then was\ncertainly against the run of play and came as a huge consolation to the\nexhausted tourists who had criss-crossed the country for six weeks.\nWaugh and his men had a plan for the final in Delhi and it worked.\nWith the star openers sent back with just R on the board, they steadily\ntightened their grip on the match and then sealed it with Bevan and\nWaugh batting them through to victory.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fBut if Australia, and Warne in particular, were relieved at the end\nof the tour, they could hardly have foreseen what was awaiting them\nin Sharjah just days later.\n\nMusical Chairs\n\n Desert Storm\n\nI'll be having nightmares of Sachin just running down the wicket and belting\nrne back over the head for six.-Shane Warne\nA mere three days after India lost to Australia in the final of the Pepsi\nCup, the two teams were in Sharjah for the Coca-Cola Cup, with\nNew Zealand joining the fray. For the first time in ten years, Pakistan\nwas not part of the Sharjah tournament. Just four months before, the\nIndian team had been the object of derision, and the captain had been\ndisplaced after they had crashed to three defeats in a row. Now\nTendulkar was determined to prove a point to the spectators who had\ninsulted him and his team in December .\nThe format of the tournament had each team playing the other\ntwice in the league stage. The start was low-key, hardly indicative of\nthe fireworks that were to follow. New Zealand ran India close despite\nGanguly's century, before fading out and losing by  runs. It was\nIndia's first win in Sharjah after five straight defeats. The next day, the\nKiwis were brushed aside by six wickets by Australia, and now it was\nthe turn of the Big Two to clash in their first league encounter, which\nwas ex-pected to be a dress rehearsal for the final. Once again, it was\nTendulkar who played the lone hand, though a losing one. His  was\nthe highest score of the match and won him the Man of the Match\naward. But it was little consolation as the Aussies ran out easy winners\nby  runs. The nightmare ofDecember  seemed to have returned\nto haunt the Indians; the very next day; they went down by four wickets\nto New Zealand. The Kiwis excelled in the field and three oflndia's\ntop batsmen-Tendulkar, Azhar and Jadeja-were run out. Suddenly;\n\n\fthere was the unexpected possibility oflndia not making it to the final.\nAustralia rested some of their key players when they faced New\nZealand for the second time, and yet emerged easy winners to book\ntheir place in the final. As has so often been the case before and since,\nIndia now brought it down to the last game. They would have to\neither beat Australia outright, or raise their net run rate above that of\nNew Zealand to reach the final. The organizers were hoping for an\nIndia-Australia clash for the title, as the crowds had been disappointing\ntill then. But the Australians were in no mood to oblige in the return\ngame.\nFor the first time in the tournament, the stadium was full. Many\nIndian fans felt this might be their last chance to see their team in\naction. Their pessimism was only heightened when Australia\neffortlessly made the highest total of the tournament, a huge  for .\nMichael Bevan remained not out on  and Mark Waugh took .\nThe target:  to win,  to qualify on run rate. These were\nrevised to  and  after a sandstorm lopped off four overs from the\nchase. In the end, India lost, but still made it to the final. Thanks to\nTendulkar, the real winner of the dramatic night. 'Second Only to\nBrad man' was the headline of the tournament report in the Cricketer\nInternational Oune ), and few who were there at Sharjah or watched\nthe match on \\ would argue with that assessment.\nThe morale of the Indian team was already low after the defeat by\nthe underdogs, New Zealand. It was compounded by the sandstorm\nthat disrupted play after they had lost their four top batsmen, Ganguly,\nMongia, Azhar and Jadeja. Their cause now looked more hopeless\nthan ever. The score at that stage was  for  in  overs. To reach\nthe final on better run rate, India needed  runs from the next \novers. Laxman hung around to give Tendulkar some support. But it\nwas clear to Tendulkar himself that only he could turn the tide. He\nproceeded to attack the bowling as though it were a club side. He\nplayed every shot in the book and some that had never been seen on a\ncricket field. The Australians were sent reeling by the murderous\nassault and wilted in the desert heat. As millions watched at home in\nIndia on their \\ sets, they must have missed a heartbeat or two. One\nDesert Storm\n\n\n\n\fshot landed in no man's land, another was dropped on the boundary.\nBut the gods were smiling on the champion that day. By the time he\nwas given out to a highly dubious decision, caught behind off Gillespie,\nthe deed had been done. India were in the final. His masterly  had\ncome from  balls and had nine fours and five sixes in it. The next\nhighest score was Mongia's . Tendulkar was stunned by the decision\nthat sent him on his way and lingered for a moment in disappointment.\nStill, he knew he had done his job, and there was an unmistakable\nswagger in his walk up the steps as his teammates rushed to pat him\non the back. 'I wish we had won the match,' he said later that evening,\nafter receiving yet another Man of the Match award for his fourteenth\ncentury.\nLooking back on that night, having watched the match on video,\nTendulkar expressed surprise at the manner in which he strode into\nthe pavilion. 'Though India lost the match, we qualified. When I\ncame back inside, I was angry because of my dismissal. But I realized\nthat we had a chance against the Australians in the next match. What\nI can't forget about the incident is the swagger with which I walked\ninto the dressing room. I was walking like Viv Richards. I don't think\nI will ever forget that walk,' he said (Outlook,  August ).\nUnbelievable as it may seem,  hours later, Tendulkar matched\nthat magical innings of his, stroke for stroke. India had lost in the\nPepsi Cup finals at home, after winning all their preliminary matches.\nNow it was the turn of Australia to suffer the same fate in the CocaCola Cup.\nThe occasion was perfect. It was Sachin's twenty-fifth birthday\nThe stage was just right-India v Australia in front of, Indian\nfans. The result was fitting-another match-winning century from\nthe birthday boy. Australia's  for  had set up another challenging\ntarget for the Indians. In the end, they made it relatively easily, winning\nby six wickets with nine balls to spare. Tendulkar's share this time\nround was  from  balls, with  fours and three sixes. And once\nagain, it was a dubious umpiring decision that saved the bowlers from\nfurther humiliation.\nEven the Aussies waxed eloquent after the match. Steve Waugh\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fconfessed that Tendulkar had to be the best after Bradman: 'We were\nbeaten hy one man. It is difficult to control Sachin when he is on song.\nWhat sort of field can one set for a batsman who has so many shots to\nplay?' This was echoed by the long-suffering Warne whose ten overs\nin the final went for  runs: 'He was unstoppable. I don't think anyone,\napart from Don Brad man, is in the same class. He is just an amazing\nplayer.'\nRichie Benaud was another awestruck Aussie, calling Sachin's\ntwo centuries the most glorious exhibition ofbatting he had ever seen\nin limited-overs cricket, ranking with two other innings he had seen\nfrom Viv Richards.\nLater that year, Sachin revealed that he had set himself a goal before\nthe tournament: to win it for India. And he succeeded.\nSachin had scored  (average ) against the best team in the\nworld, in ten matches in both forms of cricket over a two-month\nperiod. This included one double century, five centuries and t\\vo s.\nAnd the land that produced the one and only Don realized what it felt\nlike to be on the opposite side of a batting legend.\nBack home, mass Sachin hysteria had broken out across the country.\nThe nation's favourite son had marked his twenty-fifth birthday with\na dominating display, the likes of which Indian sports lovers had never\nseen before. And all of it live on television. Harsha Bhogle writing in\nthe Spottstar ( May ) sounded a note of caution: 'The issue with\nSachin Tendulkar is not whether he can keep his sense of balance\namidst the uncontrolled hysteria that surrounds his existence. It is\nwhether we can keep ours. It is not how he reacts to the persistent\nscrutiny that is important. It is the quality of the scrutiny itself.' Wise\nwords. But the:, who was listening?\nThere was no stopping the comparisons with Sir Donald Brad man\nnow. One news magazine even brought out an entire special issue\ndedicated to Sachin, complete with a specially commissioned poem\nand painting and an artist's rendering of a stamp. It was all a bit over\nthe top. Tendulkar's greatness lay in his feats in both forms of the\ngame. In Test cricket, several others had achieved far more by the time\nthey turned twenty-five.\nDesert Storm\n\n\n\n\fWhat was phenomenal was the amount of cricket Sachin had\nplayed in the last nine years. Though his average at the same age was\nless than that ofBradman ( Tests; average . ), Viv Richards (/\n.), Garry Sobers (/.), and Javed Miandad (/.),\nTendulkar had played  Test matches (average .)- per cent\nmore than Miandad. On top of that was the huge number of OD!s\n(nearly ) he had played in. This was the twin load borne by the\nmodern player, especially by those playing for India, who over the last\nfew years had been saddled with a massive schedule of international\nmatches.\nThe Coca-Cola tri-series at home with cricket babes Kenya and\nBangladesh generated more interest in the cola wars than in the action\nitsel\u00a3 Held at the height of summer, this was a tournament where the\neventual winner was never in any doubt. Tendulkar was rested for the\nfirst two matches, apparently much against his own wishes. Certainly,\nthe organizers were keen to have him back as the Indians also rested\nsome other big names and tried out a number of new faces- players\nin all were fielded in the five matches. Tendulkar's return for the\nsecond game against Bangladesh ensured a full house at the Wankhede\nStadium. He contributed  as India won by five wickets, as they had\ndone in the first match.\nThere was a shock in the return match against Kenya at Gwalior.\nAlready assured of a place in the final, the Indians were beaten by \nruns, with Tendulkar falling for . Fired by this defeat and his two\nfailures with the bat, Tendulkar led a resurgent India in the final against\nKenya at Eden Gardens. The Kenyan total of  was overhauled in\ndouble-quick time- overs, to be precise. The former captain's\ncontribution was  not out from  balls. He was now only one\nstep removed from the world record of   tons held by West Indian\nopener Desmond Haynes.\nThe amazing title run of the Indians continued in Sri Lanka where,\nthe year before, they had had a dismal tour. But now, with Azhar back\nat the helm, they could scarcely do wrong. They won their fourth title\nin seven months after finishing with just one the year before. The\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fSinger Akai Nidahas (meaning 'independence' in Sinhalese) Trophy\ntri-series with New Zealand as the third team, was the latest of the\nsubcontinent's celebratory tournaments-none of which were won\nby the celebrants themselves. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh had all\npreviously failed to please their home fans and the trend was carried\ninto Sri Lanka.\nAs with all tournaments held here in June-July, rain played a major\nrole. This time round, all three league matches at Galle had to be\ncalled off without a ball being bowled. Colombo also saw two 'noresults', and New Zealand gained points without winning a single\nmatch.\nThe opening game of the tournament saw India record one of its\nmost emphatic victories over Sri Lanka. Openers Ganguly () and\nTendulkar () put on a sparkling  in  overs, easily overhauling\nSri Lanka's  for , with eight wickets and plenty of deliveries to\nspare. But the Indians were almost done in by the rain rule, in their\nnext match against New Zealand. They had raced to  for  in .\novers, Tendulkar () galloping to his  in  balls, in reply to New\nZealand's  for . That's when the rain came down with only four\nballs needed for it to be considered a contest. If that had happened,\nIndia would have needed  runs in  overs to be deemed winners!\nMter a week of nearly non-stop rain at Galle, the action moved\nback to Colombo, and this time it was Sri Lanka who nosed out India\nby eight runs in a match reduced to  overs a side. The two sides\nexpectedly met in the final, which proved to be a real humdinger. The\nIndian innings was marked by a world record opening stand of\nruns from  overs by Ganguly and Tendulkar. Both got centuries,\nwith Tendulkar in his one hundred and ninty-sixth ODI now level\nwith Haynes after his  from  balls. It was Tendulkar's third\ncentury and third Man of the Match award in three consecutive triseries finals in the span of three months, India having won all three.\nThe pair were out to successive deliveries, though there was an element\nof doubt in third umpire Peter Manuel's decision against Tendulkar.\nManuel took his time over the stumping appeal offJayasuriya, even\nas it appeared that the batsman's right toe was within the crease.\nDesert Storm\n\n\n\n\fA heroic century by Aravinda de Silva, hobbled by a groin strain,\ntook the home side within a few runs oflndia' s  for . But Agarkar\npicked up four wickets and they fell short in the last over of a pulsating\nfinal, by six runs. It was heady stuff for Azhar and his men. In five ODI\ntri-series in the year so far, they had won four and lost only the final of\nthe Pepsi Cup at home to Australia.\nAnd there was still more to follow.\n\n\n\nSachin The Don and I\n\nHe spoke and we listened in awe.-Sachin Tendulkar\nAt his home in Australia, the legendary Sir Donald Brad man watched\nSachin Tendulkar on television and saw in his batting a reflection of\nhis own style. This was during the  World Cup match against\nAustralia at Mumbai, a match in which Sachin scored . 'He plays\nmuch the same as I played,' were Sir Don's exact words during a rare\ntelevision interview on Australia's Channel Nine (May ). The\ninterview was accompanied by split screen shots of Bradman and\nTendulkar and their similar stroke play.\nSir Don played his final Test in . In the decades since, he had\npaid fulsome praise to many batsmen who followed him, notably\nWest Indians Sir Garry Sobers and Sir Vivian Richards, South Mrican\nBarry Richards, and Indian opener Sunil Gavaskar, the only man to\nscore more Test centuries than Brad man himself\nHowever, he obviously felt a special affinity for Tendulkar. Both\nwere icons in their respective countries, both short men whose first\ninstinct was always to attack and dominate the bowlers. They were\nalso both precocious talents, though in this regard Tendulkar made an\nimpact at a much younger age than the Australian legend. Averse as\nSachin is to comparisons, he gently chided Sir Don for making an\n'unfair' comparison, in a television interview. It was said with a wry\nsmile on his face. For Tendulkar knew that while he could shrug off\nsuch comparisons made by journalists, it was a different matter when\nthe world's greatest batsman himselfwent on record with such a telling\ncomment. Tendulkar also made the point that he would be happy ifhe\n\n\fcould retire with an average half that ofBradman's-an astounding\n..\nBradman played  Tests from  to , interrupted by World\nWar II. In fact, at the same stage ( Tests), Tendulkar's average was\nprecisely half that ofBradman's. These are their comparative records:\nBradman:  Tests;  innings;  not out;  runs; . average;\n highest score; s: ; s: ; Os: . Tendulkar:  Tests; \ninnings;  not out;  runs; . average;  highest score; \ns;  s;  ducks. Still, after his fabulous exploits in Sharjah, the\ncomparisons flew thick and fast. Naturally, then, there was huge\nexcitement when Sir Don invited Tendulkar to his Adelaide home on\nthe occasion of his ninetieth birthday on  August .\nThe Indian team was at the training camp in Chennai for the\nSahara Cup, when the invitation came. Tendulkar received special\npermission from BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur to fly to Australia.\nOne of the few dissenting voices was surprisingly that of Sunil\nGavaskar who, in his syndicated column, publicly urged Tendulkar\nnot to leave the camp. He also revealed that during the - tour\nto Australia, Tendulkar had turned down Gavaskar's invitation to\njoin him on a visit to Sir Don.\nThe day was marked by a charity dinner in Bradman's honour,\nwhich was attended by , guests-but not by the great man himself.\nHis celebrations were private, a quiet dinner with his son, daughter\nand two grandchildren. In the afternoon, Tendulkar and Shane Warne,\nattired in matching suits, dropped by to spend time at Sir Don's home.\nBradman had also expressed his appreciation ofWarne's leg-spinning\nskills, though he always maintained that another Australian legspinner, Bill O'Reilly, was the greatest bowler he had seen. It was the\nfirst time either of the two giants of the contemporary game were\nmeeting cricket's all-time legend; both were understandably nervous.\n'I was tense. I did not know where to begin, what to ask. But Sir\nDon made us feel easy. He spoke and we listened in awe,' Tendulkar\ntold Sanjay Raj an of the Sportstar ( September ) on his return to\nChennai. The meeting lasted for an hour and both Warne and\nTendulkar were pleasantly surprised to learn of Sir Don's high regard\n\n\nSachin\n\n\ffor the modern game. 'Sir Don, who watches a lot of cricket on\ntelevision, spoke about the present-day game. He said the standard\nnow is very high and competitive and the fielding very good. He said\none-day cricket is attacking and exciting, though he loves Test cricket,'\nsaid Tendulkar.\nThere were two aspects ofBradman' s career that Sachin was curious\nabout. 'I asked him what was his initial movement while playing\nquick bowling and then his approach to the spinners. He said, to fast\nbowlers his initial movement was back-and-across and for the spinners\nan initial front-foot movement, though not a front-foot commitment.'\nSir Don, in turn, asked Sachin if he moved before the ball left the\nbowler's hand. 'I don't know,' was his reply. But Sir Don was insistent.\n'I think you do. You begin your movement before the bowler bowls,\notherwise you wouldn't have the time to play the kind of shots you\ndo,' reported Tendulkar in Outlook ( September ). (A year later,\nTendulkar himself spoke ofhis ability to anticipate the bowler's action\ndepending on the previous few deliveries, and even to 'compel' the\nbowler to bowl in a certain way-just as Bradman was said to have\ndone in his own playing days.)\nBrad man also expressed surprise that Sachin had been coached. 'I\nhave had three coaches, one in school, one at the state level and one at\nTest level,' Tendulkar told him. 'I didn't think you were coached,'\nconfessed Sir Don, 'because anybody who's been through coaches is\ntold to play with the left elbow pointed towards mid-ofi You don't do\nthat. I didn't do that. That gives you the flexibility to play in any\ndirection anywhere.'\nThe second question Tendulkar posed to Sir Don was on his 'mental\npreparation' before a big match. The answer surprised him. 'He told\nme he would work in office between  and  in the morning, play the\nmatch and go back to work again.'\nSir Don repeated one~ again his observation that Sachin was the\nbest batsman in the world at the moment and the closest in style to the\nway he himselfhad played. He felt that among contemporary batsmen,\nBrian Lara took more risks, and Warne agreed: 'Yes, he takes more\nrisks. I think I can get him out anytime I want. He has so many\nThe Don and I\n\n\n\n\fopenings. But with Tendulkar the problem is that there are no\nopenings. He can spot the length of a delivery better than any other\nhuman being.'\nSir Don did not give Sachin any particular advice on batting.\n'Before leaving, I told him that India was scheduled to play a series in\nAustralia in , to which he said, \"Hopefully, I should be able to\ncome and watch.\"'\nTendulkar's lasting impression was of 'the kindness of that\nremarkable person. Though the greatest batsman of all time and\nAustralia's greatest sportsperson, Sir Don is so down to earth. He has\nstayed away from publicity and controversy all these years.' On a\npersonal note, the photograph of Tendulkar, Warne and Sir Don\ntogether-and signed by all three-is the favourite item in my cricket\nmemorabilia collection.\nThe charity dinner that evening was marked by another\nTcndulkar-Warne duel-this time at the bidding for an autographed\nphotograph of Brad man dating back to . The batsman emerged\nthe winner with a bid of $A  (about Rs ,).\nWhen Sir Don passed away on the eve of the first India v Australia\nTest at Mumbai in February , Tendulkar and Warne led the tributes\nwith their memories of that August afternoon two years earlier. And it\nemerged a few months later that Sir Don had posthumously paid\nSachin Tendulkar the ultimate compliment. He was the only\ncontemporary cricketer to figure in his all-time World XI.\nTendulkar flew straight from Australia to New Delhi after meeting\nBradman. Here, he was to receive the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award,\nthe nation's highest sports-specific honour, from President\nK.R.Narayanan at Rashtrapati Bhavan, on  August. The Khel Ratna\nhad been instituted by the government in - as a sort of'super'\nArjuna Award, the annual award given to meritorious sports persons\nsince . Surprisingly, for such a cricket-mad nation, Tendulkar\nwas the first cricketer to receive the Khel Ratna, and the only one so far.\nFor some weeks before the function, the private television company\nI was working for was in touch with WorldTel in order to get Tendulkar\ninto the studios for a series ofinterviews. Everything was agreed upon\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fand we arrived at the Rashtrapati Bhavan with our camera crews,\nready to bring Tendulkar back with us. Sourav Ganguly and Ajay\nJadeja were among the Arjuna Awardees. With three cricketers at the\nfunction, there was pandemonium in the normally staid environs of\nthe President's official residence.\nThe first shock came when the press discovered that all their\nreserved seating had been taken by the President's staff and family.\nOnce the awards were presented amidst all the pomp and ceremony, it\nwas time for the informal tea session hosted by the President for the\nvarious dignitaries, sports officials, the press, and the awardees and\ntheir families. I was just a few feet away from the President and was\nshocked to see him standing alone in a corner, teacup in hand. He\nseemed equally shocked, judging by his expression.\nThe President oflndia had been abandoned by his security staff,\nministers and YIPs-all of whom had made a beeline for the only\nperson who seemed to matter on the day. Sachin was acco!panied by\nhis wife Anjali and a family friend. They found themselves hemmed\nin by hundreds of hysterical autograph hunters. He turned to her,\nwhispered a few words, and the next thing we knew, they had bolted-with fans in desperate chase. It was the quickest of quick singles as\nthey reached the car and sped off, leaving behind hundreds of unsigned\nautograph books. Even Jadeja and Ganguly had all but been forgotten.\nInside, the other sports persons were grumbling and muttering. Once\nagain, their moment of glory had been hijacked by cricketers.\nMy colleague and I, and our camera crew, piled into our vehicles\nand followed Tendulkar to the hotel. There, we were told he would\nnot be able to make it to the studio and we would have to be satisfied\nwith a quick 'shoot' by the hotel swimming pool. Apparently, Anjali\nwanted her husband to accompany her on a shopping excursion into\ntown. We were none too happy, as may be imagined.\nA harried looking Sachinjoined us after some time, after having\nchanged from formals into jeans and a checked shirt. He snapped at\nthe camera crew with a 'jaldi kar' (be quick) as they set up the\nequipment-though he was courteous to me and my fellow reporter.\nI did notice that Viv Richards swagger return as I greeted him in the\nThe Don and I\n\n\n\n\flobby and escorted him outdoors. I thought to myself, how is it possible\nfor a young man constantly in the spotlight and adored by millions to\nkeep his head? And what a year it had been already-the thrashing of\nthe Australians and the taming of Shane Warne at home and abroad,\nMan of the Match at the Diana Memorial match at Lord's, a private\naudience with the Don-and now the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna.\nThese were the topics we covered in an interview that lasted just\nover four minutes, as foreign tourists sunbathing in the background\nlooked on curiously. As the cameras were being set up, I mentioned to\nhim something I had read in the papers-that Sir Don's son John had\nturned to his father as Sachin left their residence and commented:\n'What a bonzer!' With a grin Sachin asked me what 'bonzer' meant,\nand I explained to him it was Australian slang for an all-round great\nguy.\nTendulkar was polite but obviously irppatient-wife and shopping\nwere waiting. He answered all the questions put to him briefly. But\nafter that day, he has made it a point to wave or greet me whenever our\npaths have crossed.\nPerhaps he was pleased with the interview.\n\n\n\nSachin On Top of the World\n\nIt zvas as though he zvas having a net.-Allan Donald\nThe Mccv Rest of the World match at Lord's on July was held\nto commemorate Dr W.G.Grace's hundred and fiftieth birth\nanniversary. Officialiy, however, it was known as the Diana, Princess\nofWales Memorial Match, as all proceeds (\u00a3,) were contributed\nto the Memorial Fund. Although it was an exhibition match, ,\npeople turned up to see a glittering array of  of the world's best\ncricketers.\nTendulkar found himself leading the Rest of the World XI. The\nMCC XI were led by Mike Atherton and had in their ranks the current\nIndian captain, Mohammad Azharuddin, as well as Ani! Kumble,\nJavagal Srinath and Sourav Ganguly. Though the usual tension\nassociated with an official international match was obviously missing,\nthe cricket was played seriously.\nMCC XI scored  for  in the allotted  overs, with West Indian\nleft-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul top-scoring with  not out.\nAzhar contributed a delightful . The MCC attack was formidable,\nwith Allan Donald, Srinath, Glenn McGrath and Kumble. Sanath\nJayasuriya opened with Tendulkar, but was soon lbw to Srinath and\nDonald picked up Saeed Anwar cheaply to leave the Rest of the World\nat  for . Aravinda De Silva then joined his captain of the day for the\nmost entertaining part of a delightful game. The two added  and\nensured their team won the match by six wicket~ with plenty to spare.\nTendulkar was initially scratchy and was troubled by Srinath. But he\nwas soon into his stride and was particularly severe on the part-time\n\n\fleft-arm spin of Aamir So hail, whose two overs were smashed for \nruns. By the time he was bowled by Kumble fat , he had batted for\n balls, with  fours and four sixes. Even the bowlers were impressed.\nAt one point, Allan Donald actually said, 'Good shot!', something he\nhad never said to a batsman at any time in his career. He thought\nSachin the best looking batsman he had ever seen; everything was\nright in his technique and judgement, entirely without a fault.\n'I do not think even WG. would have played like Sachin,' exclaimed\nthe normally taciturn Atherton. 'Perhaps a hundred years from now\nMCC will stage a Tendulkar Memorial match.'\nFor an Indian cricketer to play for his country for nearly a decade and\nnot be involved in a major controversy, is one more 'record' Tendulkar\ncould have claimed. Except for a publicity-hungry politician-cumcareer-sports-oflicial who attempted to tarnish his reputation and\nimplied motives to him that had the cricketing fraternity up in arms.\nIt was a clash of egos and dates that set the Indian Olympic\nAssociation (loA) and the HC:CI on a collision course. For the first time,\ncricket was to be played at the Commonwealth Games (it would also\nbe the last time) at Kuala Lumpur. Unfortunately, the dates for the\nGames clashed with those for the India v Pakistan annual Sahara\n'Friendship Series' in Toronto, which had been launched with much\nfanfare in .\nThe success of cricket and the amount of coverage it gets in the\nmedia has always been a sore point with those representing other\nsports, who react with a mixture of envy, awe and resentment. At the\nsame time, the officials of the IOA have always resented the fact that the\nnee! is the only autonomous sporting federation in the land. And all\nthanks to the huge amount of money that flows into its coffers while\nother sports associations have to go with begging bowl in hand to get\nmeagre funds from a hard-up government.\nThe Commonwealth Games was not recognized by the\nInternational Cricket Council as an official event, while the Toronto\nevent was. The IOA, backed by the government, insisted on a fullstrength team being sent to Kuala Lumpur; the Sahara Cup was to be\n\n\nSachin\n\n\feither postponed or fobbed off with a second-string team. Suddenly,\nthe lOA converted the issue into one of patriotism v commercialism.\nThere were no such qualms on the part of the Pakistanis who sent a Bgrade team to Kuala Lumpur while their top players went to Toronto,\nawaiting India's challenge.\nIn fact, England, as the founders of the Commonwealth, did not\neven bother sending a team to Kuala Lumpur. Yet, once the lOA and\nBCCI locked horns, charges and counter charges began flying back\nand forth. The BCCI resented being dictated to by the lOA and was\nloathe to shed its autonomy, which it had zealously guarded for so\nmany decades. Truth to tell, there was just one player the lOA would\nhave been happy with-the rest could have been a bunch ofjuniors as\nfar as they were concerned. That one player, naturally, was Sachin\nTendulkar. Sadly, he was made a pawn in the BCCI-IOA power struggle.\nUltimately, the BCCI caved in and Tendulkar was packed off to\nKuala Lumpur. Ajay Jadeja (the captain), Robin Singh and Ani)\nKumble were the other star players in the squad. It was agreed that if\nthe Indian team made an early exit, the players would rush to Toronto\nin a bid to play in at least a couple of games in the five-match series. It\nwas a compromise that was doomed to failure. India were knocked out\nin the preliminary stage at Kuala Lumpur and lost - to Pakistan at\nToronto.\nThe conditions for cricket at Kuala Lumpur were sub-standard,\nespecially the pitches. The weather was appalling too. It was a novel\nexperience for the cricketers, having to stay in the Games Village\nrather than in the luxury of five-star hotels. But they didn't complain.\nIn fact, Tendulkar and the others quite enjoyed the atmosphere.\nIndia were struggling at  for  in . overs when rain washed out\ntheir opening match against Antigua and Barbuda, spearheaded by\nCurtly Ambrose, with Sir Viv Richards as their coach. The West Indies\nwere competing as separate nations as they do at the Olympics. The\nAntigua pace attack was augmented by Eldine Baptiste and Kenneth\nBenjamin and it was Baptiste who got rid ofTendulkar for . There\nwas an even bigger shock in the next game against Canada, with the\nbest batsman in the world out for two, the victim of an unknown On Top of the World\n\n\n\n\fyear-old from Granada by the name ofDavisJoseph. The team's final\ntotal of for  owed much to young Amay Khurasia's . Fortunately\nfor the Indians, the Canadian batsmen then proceeded to fold up for\n against Kumble, who finished with  for .\nThe last league match against Australia was a do-or-die game for\nIndia. Australia were struggling at  for  before skipper Steve Waugh\nscored a century, an innings which he said was his 'most satisfYing' in\none-day cricket-though it will not be in the record books. This time\nTendulkar scored  before he fell to Damien Fleming. But India\ncould only muster  in reply to  for , and their campaign fizzled\nout. There is little doubt that the minds of many of the players were in\nToronto. The rumour was then floated that the Indians had, in fact,\nbooked their tickets even before their last league match.\nWhatever be the truth, it was obvious that the whole thing had\nbeen botched up from the start, thanks to the egos ofofficials on both\nsides of the fence. And as has always been the case, it was the sportsmen\nwhose reputations suffered the most. Indian cricket had striven in\n to overcome the traumas of the year before. Now much of that\ngood work had been undone by this farce. The Pakistani team\nmanagement had initially objected to India flying in replacements\nfrom Kuala Lumpur. But the sponsor's desperation for more star faces,\nand Tendulkar in particular, saw the protests subsequently shelved.\nSachin landed in Toronto after  overs of the fourth game had\nbeen bowled. In effect, he had flown across the world for just one\nmatch. Still jet-lagged from his marathon flight, he managed to crack\n in India's total of  for  in the fifth and final match; skipper\nAzhar top-scored with . But it wasn't enough and Pakistan romped\nhome by five wickets to take the series -.\nSubsequently, World Tel felt constrained to issue a press statement\nrebutting the harsh comments made by some of the Indian officials\nagainst the cricket team, and specifically Tendulkar, for the poor show\nat Kuala Lumpur. Tendulkar expressed his sentiments in an interview\nto Vijay Lokapally in the Sptstar ( October ): 'I have always\ntaken great pride in representing the country and nothing gives me\ngreater joy than seeing the tri-colour flutter high in the stands.'\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fStraight from Toronto, it was off to Zimbabwe for the weary Indians.\nThe one-offTest at Harare was a disaster. It ended in four days;\nZimbabwe were winners by  runs. Medium-pacer Neil Johnson\non his debut got Tendulkar in both innings, for  and . There was\nsome consolation, though, in the one-day series which India claimed\n- at the start of the short tour. And at Bulawayo in the opening\ngame, Tendulkar scored his eighteenth ODI century to overtake West\nIndian opener Desmond Haynes' world record. It had taken Haynes\n years to score his  tons. Tendulkar's eighteenth came four years\nafter his first in Colombo in . Of course, the number of games\nplayed by the Indians in the late s was also a factor. But it took\nSachin  innings (in his hundred and ninety-eighth om) fewer than\nthe West Indian and that is the true barometer. Ten of Tendulkar's\ntons had come abroad and the rest at home. It meant that Indian\nbatsmen now held the record for most centuries in Tests ( by Sunil\nGavaskar) and oms. Sachin's  not out in India's eight-wicket win\nwas his sixth of the year, and there would be more to follow.\nThe golden run of the Indian team had begun in Dhaka. Now it\nwas back to the Bangladeshi capital for the inaugural ICC mini-World\nCup knockout tournament. The tournament was a success, with huge\ncrowds at the Bangabandhu Stadium for every match. South Mrica\nlifted the Wills Trophy, beating the West Indies by four wickets in the\nfinal. Tendulkar left his mark on the tournament in the third quarterfinal where India faced Australia, this time minus Warne and McGrath.\nGanguly and Azhar went early to make it  for . Then Tendulkar\nand Dravid began the rebuilding and Jadeja weighed in with  to\ntake India past the -run mark. Tendulkar was awesome. Some of\nthe shots he pulled off were extraordinary. He hit five cracking fours\noffKasprowicz, but early on decided not to take the aerial route. By the\ntime he was smartly run out for  from  balls, he had smashed\n fours and three sixes and the Indian total of for  was a formidable\none.\nAustralia too began well. They were  for  when Tendulkar\nwas tossed the ball and started conjuring up wickets with his assortment\nof 'offies' and 'leggies'. He accounted for Steve Waugh, caught ancl\nOn Top of the World\n\n\n\n\fbowled, and then added Michael Ievan, Damien Martyn and Brad\nYoung to his bag. The final figures: .---. Only Viv Richards\nhas scored a century and taken five wickets in an ODI. Tendulkar came\npretty close, and the Australians were all out for . He listed the \nas his greatest innings in an interview with Sebastian Coe (Daily\nTelegraph,  May ): 'Nobody expected us to win. It was the day\nthat everything came together. I can still remember almost every stroke\nI played that day.'\nThe innings also took Sachin past his own record for most ODI\nruns in a year. In  he had  in  matches. Now in , in \nmatches ( innings, four not out) he would compile  runs at\n., with nine OOs and seven s, at a strike rate of . ! But\nIndia's run in the tournament came to an end in the ne;...\"t match, the\nsemi-final against the West Indies, in which they were beaten by six\nwickets with Tendulkar out at eight.\nIt was back to Sharjah then, for the Coca-Cola Champions Trophy,\nwith Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka as the competition. And it would be\nanother trophy in the bag for the Indians. Despite both their prolific\nopeners falling cheaply, India won their opening match against the\nSri Lankans by three wickets. It was an unhappy week for the world\nchampions as they lost all four of their matches to make it a rare\nZimbabwe v India final. Tendulkar notched up his twentieth century\nagainst Zimbabwe for a grand total of  centuries in international\ncricket, taking him past Sunil Gavaskar, Viv Richards and Desmond\nHaynes, all of whom had a combined Test and ODI total of centuries.\nThere was a surprise in the return encounter. By this time, the Sri\nLankans were eliminated and the Indians were not at either full\nstrength or full pace. It was the ideal opportunity for Henry Olonga to\nprove a point and he did so forcefully and dramatically. Chasing a\nmeagre total of for , the Indian batsmen were rocked by a searing\nspell from the dreadlocked fast bowler, in which he had the prize\nscalps of Ganguly, Tend ulkar, Dravid and Jadeja-the cream of the\ncrop. Tendulkar was surprised by one that took off nastily and had\nhim groping with his bat held high, to be caught by Grant Flower for\n. It was Olonga's first match of the tournament and the fact that he\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fmade a master like Tendulkar look uncomfortable at the crease was\nthe talking point when the two teams met in the final  hours later.\nThere was no doubt that Tendulkar's ego had been dented. He has\nalways taken it as a personal challenge to go after the best bowler in the\nopposition, as in the case of McGrath and Warne. This time it was\nOlonga. Zimbabwe's total of  for  was never going to be enough.\nBut their bowlers could scarcely have foreseen the hammering ahead\nof them. The total was passed with contemptuous ease in just  overs.\nAnd perhaps for the first time in a tournament, without the loss of a\nsingle wicket. It was India's fifth tournament title of the year in their\nrecord-breaking fortieth ODI in . They also won the ODI series in\nZimbabwe.\nTendulkar's  not out was virtually double that of his partner\nGanguly's contribution (), a measure ofhis total domination at the\ncrease. Olonga came in for special treatment. His figures: ---. A\nf.r cry from his performance just two days earlier. Tendulkar's century\nwas his fastest (and the fourth fastest of all), from  balls, and had a\nfi.nal boundary tally of six sixes and  fours. It was close to the Indian\nrecord held by Azhar ( balls). The first  took only  balls, inclusive\noffour sixes and five fours. The stand with Ganguly fetched  in the\nfirst  overs as Tendulkar went hell for leather after a dropped catch\nwhen he was on , offleg-spinner Paul Strang who was carted for \nruns from his five overs. Forty-one were smashed from Olonga's first\nfour overs,  of which came from Tendulkar's bat. One six was slashed\nover backward point, the ball picked from well outside off stump.\nBefore that came an extra cover drive. Then he pulled the hapless\nbowler from outside off stump. In desperation, Olonga tried a slower\nball, to no avail. The ball landed in the stands, above wid ish long off\nA chastened  longa was taken off and forced to lick his wounds.\nTendulkar had another world record to his credit- Man of the\nMatch awards in  matches, against  in  by Viv Richards. 'I\ndecided to enjoy my batting. I thought that the final was the right time\nto play some shots. The pitch was really good today and the ball came\non nicely,' he said after the magnificent innings. 'Olonga is an\ninternational bowler. He can bowl some good deliveries and he got\nOn Top of the World\n\n\n\n\fmy wicket. I accept that. But I went to the nets and worked on my\nbatting.' As he said later in the year, he had a point to prove: that he\ncould be taken by suprise once, but it wasn't going to happen everyday.\nLooking back on that triumphant year, Azhar described Tendulkar\nas the team's 'pillar of strength'.\nThere was just enough time in the calendar to squeeze in one final\ntour, this one to New Zealand for three Tests and five oms, which\nspilled over into January . India had not won a series in New\nZealand since the first in - and the trend continued as they\nwere beaten - while the  series was locked at -. Mter the first\nTest had been completely washed out, New Zealand won the second\nat Wellington by four wickets, despite centuries by Azhar and\nTendulkar. The third ended in a draw.\nFollowing his golden year, Tendulkar made an inauspicious start\nto , out for a duck in the first  at Taupo. He followed with\nscores of ,  and , but had to miss the fifth and final match at\nChristchurch (the third was a 'no-result') after suffering a wrist injury\nin the fourth game at Auckland.\nIt was an ominous beginning to a year that would be marked by\ntragedy.\n\n\n\nSachin\n 'The Greatest Series Ever'\n\nI did not feel any pressure.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nThe second and last quarters of saw two memorable performances\non the domestic circuit by Sachin Tendulkar. In April, he helped\nMumbai bounce back from a disastrous - sea~on to win the\nRanji Trophy once again. He could play just two matches, the semifinal against Tamil Nadu and the final against Hyderabad, but in\nthese his scores were phenomenal:  (not out),  (not out),  and\n.\nIn December, he made a rare appe::trance, this time virtually in his\nbackyard! .For the first time, a Ranji Trophy match-Mumbai v\nBaroda-was staged at the MIG ground at Bandra, a stone's throw from\nhis home. He marked the occasion with a century, much to the delight\nof his neighbours in the stands.\nThe Ranji semi-final against Tamil Nadu had been postponed by\ntwo days to allow Tendulkar to return from Dhaka where he had led\nan Asian XI against a World XI in a one-day exhibition match. Earlier\nthat season, he had relinquished the Mumbai captaincy to Sameer\nDighe since he knew the international calendar would keep him away\nfrom domestic cricket.\nTamil Nadu had scored  in the first innings, and Mumbai were\nin danger of conceding the first innings lead when their ninth wicket\nfell at . Tendulkar had come in at the fall of the second wicket at ,\nand now had only last man Santosh Saxena for company. He pulled\nKumaran to the midwicket boundary for four to gain the lead and the\ncekhrations broke out. The last  runs of the innings had come\n\n\fentirely offhis bat. He was at the crease for  minutes-the longest\ninnings of his career-and was unbeaten on his highest first-class\nscore of ( balls,  fours, five sixes) when Saxena was given out\nwithout scoring. Mumbai eventually won by eight wickets.\nThere is a remarkable sequence offour photographs ofTendulkar,\ntaken by Vivek Bendre (Sporlstar,  April), showing him exulting\nafter guiding Mumbai to the first innings lead. The fist pumping and\nthe whoops ofjoy were unusual-rarely in international cricket does\none see him celebrating with such an outward show of emotion. It\nshowed his commitment to Mumbai cricket.\nMumbai coach and former opening batsman Ashok Mankad said\nhe had never seen a better innings in first-class cricket. Tendulkar\nhimself felt it was one of his besl. The final against Hydcrabad saw\nMumbai win by  runs. This time Tendulkar's contribution was\n and .\nThere would be another double ton in November:  not out in\nthe second Test at Nagpur against Zimbabwe. It was the fourth double\ncentury of his first-class career and coincidentally, the two hundredth\nin Test cricket history. This followed a century in the first Test at New\nDelhi and there was another in the third ODI at Jodhpur. India won the\nTest series - and the ODis -. But the visit of the Zimbabweans was\njust a warm-up session for the real thing as far as the Indian cricketers\nand fans were concerned. The real test would come with the arrival of\nSteve Waugh's all-conquering team.\nThe Aussies landed in India in February  with an awesome\nrecord. They had won  Tests in succession, an unprecedented feat.\nBut no Australian team had won a series in India since Bill Lawry's  verdict in -.\nThe pre-tour hype was huge. Waugh called India the 'final frontier'\nof his career. He had been the ODI captain under Mark Taylor when\nIndia won the  Test series - and was determined to keep alive\nhis side's ruthless streak on Indian soil. He also spoke of 'mental\ndisintegration', the infamous Aussie weapon. They used to call it\n'sledging'-abusing an opFonent on the field. Now a clever play of\nwords had resulted in a new euphemism for the traditional Aussie\nThe Greatest Series Ever\n\n\n\n\ftactic.\nThings were really hatting up for the Indian team. Sourav Ganguly\nwas still new to the job of captaincy, while Waugh was acknowledged\nas the best captain in world cricket. The Zimbabwe visit had been\nGanguly's first Test series as captain. His style was combative and it\nwas obvious this would be a toe-to-toe, eyeball-to-eyeball\nconfrontation between two strong men in charge of their respective\nsides. Ultimately, the Australian media campaign of targeting Ganguly\nbackfired. They had seen the Indians roll over tamely, without a fight,\non their soil just a year ago. But it would be different this time, with\nGanguly paying the aggressive Aussies back in their own coin. Even\nTendulkar admitted to 'sledging' Steve Waugh on the field!\nAustralia were without the injured Brett Lee but were still\nformidable, with Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath bowling in\ntandem in India for the first time. India too were without one of their\nspearheads, the injured Ani) Kumble. The series of three Tests \u00b7\nproduced some of the most memorable games in the recent past. No\nwonder the world media dubbed it 'the greatest series ever'. And in the\nend, India were - winners again.\nOn the eve of the first Test at Mumbai, the death of Sir Donald\nBradman cast a pall of gloom over the proceedings. Tendulkar and\nWarne were immediately sought o\u2022.lt for their memories of the \nvisit to his home. Both teams wore black armbands in mourning.\nHowever, the visitors won the first round by a knockout. In less than\nthree days, they tore the stuffing out of the Indian team for win number\n, and another series whitewash seemed apparent. The only saving\ngrace for India in the ten-wicket trouncing was the batting of\nTendulkar. His knocks of and  were both classics.\nOn the opening day, the Indian batting crumbled to  all out.\nThey had lost four wickets at lunch for  even as Tendulkar reached\n from  balls. Mter the break, he opened up and suddenly the\nrampaging bowlers found themselves on the back foot. The first ball\nafter lunch from old adversary Warne was cut for four. The next \nballs went for  wondrous runs. Fleming was flayed for three straight\nfours and then McGrath was back. Tendulkar succumbed yet again to\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fhis nemesis in the series Down Under.\nThe Indian bowlers struck back on the second morning. Australia\nfound themselves precariously placed at  for  and the last\nrecognized pair of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist were at the\ncrease. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh had picked up three wickets in\na sign of things to come. Then, the game was turned on its head as the\ntwo left-banders tore the Indian bowling apart. Gilchrist raced to the\nsecond fastest century by an Australian, from  balls, with  fours\nand a six. Hayden had an identical number of boundaries and their\nstand of  came from just  overs.\nTrailing by  runs, the Indian batting once again crumbled. By\nclose on the second day, they had lost both openers. Tendulkar in the\ncompany ofDravid began the rebuilding process. They put on  for\nthe third wicket and Tendulkar was at his dazzling best. Boundaries\nflowed off his bat and the bowlers seemed at their wits' end when an\namazing piece ofluck saw the Aussies gain the upper hand again.\nMark Waugh bowled one of his gentle 'offies' and Tendulkar lashed\nout with a ferocious pull. Justin Langer at short leg had taken a\npounding and now as he turned instinctively, he was struck on the left\nshoulder. The ball ballooned towards midwicket. Panting had failed\nto score, but now he pulled off a miraculous catch that turned the\ngame. He sprinted  metres to his right and flung himselfforward to\ngrasp the catch an inch above the ground. Once again, it had taken an\nextraordinary catch to end an extraordinary innings from the maestro.\nIt was obvious by now that his batting genius made rival bowlers and\nfielders strive to raise their game too.\nThe rest of the batting was soon mopped up and Slater and Hayden\nraced to the small target.\nBy the third morning of the second Test at Kolkata, it looked like\nIndian cricket's worst nightmare was unfolding. P~wered by captain\nWaugh's first Test century on Indian soil, Australia had piled up .\nIndia were then sent packing for . The follow-on was duly enforced.\nEnter VVS. Laxman to play the innings of a lifetime. His  was\nbegun on the third afternoon and stretched till the fifth morning, and\nwas the highest score by an Indian in Test cricket. This followed\nThe Greatest Series Ever\n\n\n\n\fHarbhajan Singh's hat-trick, the first by an Indian in Test cricket.\nLaxman and Dravid batted throughout the fourth day and suddenly\nthe tables were turned on Australia. Dravid's  was magnificent too,\nand his stand with Laxman was worth a massive  runs.\nGanguly declared on the fifth morning at  for . The target was\n for Australia. Had the declaration come too late? Only twice before\nhad a team lost after enforcing the follow-on in  years of Test\ncricket and on each occasion Australia had been on the receiving end.\nFinally, the match was won for India in the last hour of the match.\nHarbhajan was the bowling hero with figures of for  and  for .\nTendulkar too played his part. Though he scored only ten runs in\nboth innings, he picked up three wickets with his spin bowling.\nSachin's victims were Hayden, Gilchrist and Warne. It was the second\ntime in Tests that he had three wickets in an innings.\nAustralia were all out for  to lose by  runs. It was one of the\ngreatest moments in Indian cricket histy. Now it all came down to\nthe third and final Test at Chennai. The amazing turnaround ensured\na full house at the M.A.Chidambaram Stadium. Chennai was as hot\nand humid as ever, though not as bad as in  when the two teams\nhad been involved in only the second tied Test in history. Matches\nbetween India and Australia at Chennai have over the years produced\nsome thrilling contests, both in Tests and ODis. The third Test would\nlive up to that tradition.\nFour years earlier, Tendulkar had played a decisive innings in the\nfirst Test against Australia at Chennai:  not out. This time, his \nwould be the side's highest score, though it was Matthew Hayden's\ndouble ton and Harbhajan's -wicket haul that took the individual\nhonours in another fantastic finish. A first-day score of for  by\nAustralia had them heading for a -plus score. But it was not to be.\nWaugh's handled-the-ball dismissal triggered a collapse and they were\nall out for . With Das, Ramesh and Laxman all going past ,\nTendulkar did not walk into a crisis as he so often has done in his\ncareer. Instead, with Dravid for company, he took India past Australia's\nscore with just four wickets lost. It was his twenty-fifth century, but\nnot one of his best. He had told his teammates before the match that\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fhe was determined to stick it out and record a century in the series. It\nwas one of his more patient efforts, the runs coming from  balls\nand nearly six hours of concentration. Colin Miller, bowling seamers\nto Tendulkar and off-spinners to the rest, had the mortification of\nseeing him dropped at  on  for . He top-edged a sweep and\nMichael Slater on the midwicket boundary appeared to drop the ball\nin a premature act of celebration. Miller was immediately smashed\nover long on for six as Tendulkarjumped from to and two balls\nlater, there was a pull for four.\nSteve Waugh had reached his twenty-fifth Test ton at Kolkata.\nNow Tendulkar became the sixth to reach this landmark in his eightysecond Test and the third fastest after Don Bradman ( Tests) and\nSunil Gavaskar ( Tests). Mter reaching the century, he went after\nWarne. Twice he swept him fine as the leggie aimed for the rough\noutside the leg stump. Then he cut him cheekily over slip for four.\nTendulkar had come to the crease on the second ball of the third day\nafter McGrath had Das lbw first ball for . Exactly  overs later, he\nwas caught behind offJason Gillespie. It was his fourth century in five\nTests at Chennai, and the sixth against Australia. There were still ten\novers to be bowled in the day. But the crowd began to quietly get up\nand leave. For them, Tendulkarwas out, the entertainment for the day\nwas over, and it was time to slip away.\nI asked one of them why he was leaving when there was still some\nplay remaining. He appeared surprised to be asked the question. 'But\nSachin is out,' he said.\n'Soon, very soon, people will be turning up only to watch Tendulkar\nplay,' R. Mohan had written a decade 'earlier. The prediction had come\ntrue. It was a trend that was first noticeable during the Australia series\nand would manifest itself more starkly against England at the end of\nthe year. Sachin drew crowds the way Bradman had in the previous\ncentury, and WG. Grace in the century before that. Once the master\nbatsman was out, spectators lost interest in the rest of the day's play. It\nwas as if a game of  players on each side was reduced to just one.\nThe first-innings lead was stretched to . Openers Slater and\nHayden almost wiped it out with a stand worth . Once again, there\nThe Greatest Series Ever\n\n\n\n\fwas a collapse engineered by Harbhajan, who had  for  to finish\nwith a record  wickets, the most by a spinner for a three-Test series.\nThe target for India was only . But when Tendulkar () fended\noff a fiery bouncer from the tireless Gillespie to Mark Waugh at slip,\nthe tension around the stadium rose to breaking point. Seven down\nfor , the Indians were fighting for every run. Finally, and fittingly,\nMan of the Series Harbhajan squeezed the winning runs from\nMcGrath with only two wickets in hand. Not since the golden years\nof  and  had Indian cricket celebrated so long and hard and\njoyously.\nMter all the drama of the Test, for once the five-match one-day\nseries was looked upon as an anticlimax. However, it turned out to be\none of the best played on Indian soil as the players from both sides\ncarried on the intensity from the Tests. The obvious animosity between\nthe two captains gave the series an edge as Waugh and his men resolved\nnot to leave India empty-handed. In the end, just as they had done in\n, they bounced back from their defeat in the Test series to take the\noDJs -. Hayden and Laxman continued their batting heroics, and\nfor Tendulkar the series would bring two very special landmarks.\nIndia won the first game at Bangalore by  runs. Australia levelled\nwith a crushing eight-wicket win at Pune. India then took the lead\nagain as they won the third at Indore by  runs and then saw their\nlead pegged back when they went down by  runs at Visakhapamam.\nThe final match at Margao saw Michael Bevan play another of his\ntypical one-day gems as Australia cantered home by four wickets with\ntwo overs to spare.\nIt was a special moment at Indore for Tendulkar in his two hundred\nand sixty-sixth match ( innings) as he drove Warne to extra cover\nfor a single. That took him to  and he became the first man to score\n, runs in ODis, on his way to his twenty-eighth century. Sunil\nGavaskar in  had achieved a similar feat in Tests.\nNormally reticent about records, Sachin was candid this time in\nhis post-match comments. 'I would be lying ifl said I wasn't aware of\nthe target but I did not feel any pressure.' He seemed to have been\nbiding his time in the over before Warne's, seemingly determined to\n\n\nSachin\n\n\freach the magic mark off the spinner's bowling. The figures were\nrevealing. Sixteen of his  centuries had come abroad, in  matches,\nwhile were scored at home in  matches. Of the , runs at the\nend of the Indore game,  were scored at home at an average of\n., while  were scored abroad at fractionally under . There\nwere some other significant statistics. Twenty-two of the  tons had\nhelped India win. His strike rate was a superb . and his average\nfor final matches/grand finals was a striking .. All these figures\nwere valid until the end of the Indore match.\nAt Margao, in the fifth game, would come another milestone that\ngave him immense satisfaction. He picked up three wickets and the\none of Steve Waugh was his hundredth. , runs and  wicketsit was a unique double for a unique cricketer.\n\nThe Greatest Series Ever\n\n\n Such a Long Journey\n\nPlayingfor India has been a great privilege indeed.\n-Sachin Tendulkar on the eve of his twentieth anniversary in\ninternational cricket.\n\nOver the span of cricket history there have been times when one\nplayer's performance was enough to bring an entire nation to a haltIan Botham did just that in England in  in the series known as\n'Botham's Ashes'; Andrew Flintoff emulated his hero in . But,\nperhaps, no player has so often had the whole country in his thrall on\nso many occasions as Sachin Tendulkar.\n'Desert Storm' in ; India v Pakistan at Chennai a year later;\nthe World Cup match against Pakistan in ; and then December\n when he guided India home against England at Chennai in that\nemotional run-chase. These are just some of the more prominent\noccasiOns.\nThen on  November  with a sense ofhistory and timing that\nonly cricket's living legend was capable of, Tendulkar did it again.\nThe date was significant as  November would mark the th\nanniversary ofhis first appearance in India colours. And it also marked\na golden -month period when he could seemingly do no wrong.\nThe non-stop treadmill of international cricket-even more\npronounced now with the advent of the T - format-would have\ntaxed anyone else, both mentally and physically.\nLegendary West Indies all-rounder Garry Sobers too played nonstop (even if not the same volume) for years. But nearing the end of\n\n\fhis career, his knees were giving way and he had become sick of the\ngame.\nIn the spate of interviews marking his th anniversary, there were\ntwo common themes-Tendulkar's childlike enthusiasm and indeed\nhunger for cricket and his plea for Test matches to retain their\nprommence.\nFar from beingjaded, at the age of it appeared he was freshly\nmotivated to keep batting and keep winning for India.\nThe Australians under Ricky Ponting were back for a series of\nseven oms. But the grind of non-stop playing had taken a heavy toll\non the tourists and they were without nine of their frontline players.\nThe series was poised - going into the fifth game at Hyderabad.\nThe Australians looked to have taken the game away from the Indians\nas they piled up a mammoth  for four.\nDespite the batting-friendly wickets, such a total had never been\nsuccessfully chased down in an om on Indian soil. Now only one\nman stood between Australia and victory.\nIt was evening and the lights at the stadium were on as people\nrushed home from work to sit glued in front of their TV sets. And\nTendulkar was the focus of attention of both  Australians and\ncountless millions of fans in India and around the world. Could he\nsingle-handedly pull off another miraculous feat?\nThe years rolled back and it was  all over again. Every shot\nseemed to land just where he wanted it to, as iflaunched from his bat\nlike a series oflaser-guided missiles. Ponting and his bowlers looked\nclueless.\nAt one stage an unprecedented double century looked a distinct\npossibility even as Suresh Raina kept him company in a century stand\nfor the fifth wicket at better than a run a ball.\nThe young left-hander fell for  followed by HarabhaJan Singh\nfor a duck and now Tendulkar knew it was all up to him.\nWhen he miscued an attempted paddle scoop-an innovation of\nthe T - era-to be caught at fine leg he had blazed to a glorious \nin the course of which he also crossed ,  runs.\nBut as has happened so often in the past, the rest of the side failed\nSuch a Long Journey\n\n\n\n\fhim and India fell agonizingly short by just three runs. Tendulkar's\nface said it all as he collected his obligatory Man of the Match award.\nSave for that one brilliant innings, the series had been a quiet one\nfor Tendulkar and India were left to lick their wounds after being\nbeaten - by a second-string Australia.\nHyderabad cast him in the mould oflndian cricket's tragic hero.\nBut there was plenty of cause for jubilation and celebration by the\ntime he marked  years at the top of world cricket. The media and\npublic frenzy surrounding the landmark showed the kind of pressure\nand expectations he had had to live with throughout his amazing\ncareer.\nThe year had opened with India in Sri Lanka for an OOI series\nfollowed by New Zealand for a full tour.\nThe Lankans were outclassed -, the second time in less than six\nmonths they had been beaten by India at home in a bilateral OOI\nseries. Though Tendulkar flopped in the first three games that India\nwon (he was rested for the fourth and fifth), he was in majestic form in\nNew Zealand.\nIndia had not won a Test series in New Zealand since the inaugural\none in - and they had never clinched an  series there\neither.\nThis time it was a no-contest. The  D I verdict was - in favour\noflndia while the Test series was won -. And Tendulkar played a\nstellar role in both.\nIt was in New Zealand, back in , that Tendulkar had made\nsuch an impact on opening the batting for the first time. Now  years\nlater at Christchurch he was at his cracking best and came close to the\u00b7\nfirst double century in  history.\nWhat prevented him from carrying on was an abdominal injury\nwhich flared up after he had been hit in the stomach in the previous\nmatch. It forced him to retire hurt on  in the th over of the\ninnings. But by then he had put India well on course for a record total\nof  for four, eventually winning by  runs. The injury though\nforced him to miss the next two matches.\nSaid Kiwi captain Brendan McCullum on Tendulkar's innings:\n)\n\nSachin\n\n\f'I can hardly remember a shot that didn't come out of the middle ... I\ndon't think I have seen too many better innings, in any form of the\ngame.'\nIt had been  years since India had won a Test match in New\nZealand. Now they did it in style in Hamilton in four days for only\ntheir second overseas victory by the margin of  wickets.\nIt was Tendulkar's  in the first innings and Harbhajan's six\nwickets in the second that made it possible. The nd Test century\nwas full of forceful shots and like the Tend ulkar of yore he looked to\ndominate from the start.\nThe next two Test matches were drawn so India returned with the\nhonours from the tour.\nNow it was time again for the Indian Premier League. However,\ndue to the general elections the tournament had to be shifted from\nIndia to South Mrica in its second season. The change of venue made\nlittle difference to the fate of the Mumbai Indians.\nMter a disappointing first season when they just missed reaching\nthe semis, this time around MI finished second from the bottom. Five\nwins out of  was just not good enough for the most expensive\nfranchise in the league and once again Tendulkar was a\ndisappointment both with his leadership and with the bat scoringjust\ntwo half-centuries in  innings.\nThe Board managed to squeeze in a short and rather pointless om\ntour of the West Indies. But a finger injury kept Tendulkar out. It also\nhelped him to take a much-needed break and keep him fresh for the\nchallenges ahead.\nIndia were back in Sri Lanka in September for a tri-series, also\ninvolving New Zealand.\nIt was hardly a surprise that India took on Lanka in the final. What\ndid come as a pleasant surprise for Indian fans was their team beating\nthe hosts in the final in Colombo, only their fourth win in  om\nfinals since  and their first tournament trophy in Lanka since\n. That too after receiving a pasting in the league match just two\ndays earlier.\nThe Indian total of for four was built round a majestic innings\nSuch a Long Journey\n\n\n\n\fof  by Tendulkar which he rated as one of his best. Even veteran\nTendulkar-watchers were stunned by the range ofhis strokes, including\na series of reverse sweeps which he has rarely indulged in. The last of\nthese brought about his dismissal. But he had done enough by then.\nMter defending champions India had flopped in the World T -\nin England (minus Tendulkar of course), hopes were high of an\nimproved performance in the Champions' Trophy in South Mrica, a\ntournament in which India had twice reached the final.\nBut it was not to be. Defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the first\nleague match practically sealed India's fate. Rain prevented a result in\ntheir second game against Australia and despite beating the West Indies,\nthey failed to advance to the semi-finals.\nTowards the end of, the big question now was: how long can\nTendulkar continue? The previous  months had seen him striking\na purple patch and in this period he had played some of the most\nmemorable knocks ofhis entire career.\nWithout saying so in so many words, Tendulkar indicated in\ninterviews in  that his sights were set on the  World Cup to\nbe staged jointly by India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\nA World Cup triumph on Indian soil would be a fitting end to a\ncareer containing plenty ofhighs and a few lows, notably the lack of a\nWorld Cup title in five previous attempts.\nIndian fans could not ask for more from the Superman of world\ncricket. The One-day Phenom\n\nIt was quite satisfying.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nThe Hero Cup five-nation tournament in November  saw India\nreach the semi-final against South Mrica despite being trounced by\nWest Indies in their league game and held to a tie by Zimbabwe. The\nIndians seemed to be peaking at the right time, as they beat South\nMrica easily by  runs in the final league game at Mohali. Two days\nlater, they met again in the last four. The sole team to be eliminated\nwas Zimbabwe, with the other semi-final pitting West Indies against\nSri Lanka. Both the semis and the final were played in Kolkata under\nlights for the first time.\nTendulkar had scores of not out, ,  and . He failed with the\nbat in the semis too, caught behind by Dave Richardson off mediumpacer Richard Snell for . But he would play a crucial hand in the\nvery last over of the game. On a slow track, India had mustered a total\nof in their  overs, with skipper Azharuddin top-scoring with .\nMore than the bowlers, it was the Indian batsmen themselves who\nmade a hash of things with four run-outs. This was the first  with\na third umpire in charge of replays, and there was no escape. Vinod\nKambli was the first such victim in limited-overs cricket.\nThe South Mrican batsmen appeared overcautious in chasing the\nsmall total, and the crowd of nearly , gave them little respite.\nSrinath got captain Kepler Wessels out early, but fellow opener Andrew\nHudson survived two chances to make  as they inched their way\ntowards the target. The Indians hit back through Ajay Jadeja and Ani!\n\n\f. Kumble who picked up two wickets each to break the back of the top\norder and reduce the score to  for . The asking rate had climbed to\neight an over as the batting subsided to  for , with three run-outs,\nincluding that ofHansie Cronje at . Then came the first of many\ndramatic twists.\nIn three overs, the burly Brian McMillan and Richardson\nplundered  runs to take their side to within just seven runs of victory.\nWhen Richardson got out for , it was down to the last over, with six\nruns standing between South Mrica and the final. Srinath had conceded\n runs in his last two overs and Prabhakar had gone for . Kapil still\nhad two in harid. Who would bowl the last over to McMillan, a man\ncapable of finishing things offwith one mighty blow? It looked like a\ntoss-up between Srinath and Kapil. Then wicketkeeper Vijay Yadav\nsuggested the name ofTendulkar. The problem was that he had not\nbowled a single over so far.\nThis is manager Wadekar's version of what happened next: 'I had\nsent a message to Azhar that Kapil, being most senior and experienced,\nshould bowl the last over. When Sachin saw Kapil slightly hesitating,\nhe snatched the ball from his hand and told Azhar that he would bowl\nthe last one. Azhar had no choice.' Millions of TV viewers saw it that\nway too. The young man had grabbed the challenge as he always has\ndone in his career.\nThere were two wickets standing and six balls to go, with six runs\nto get. Bowling tantalizingly slow medium-pacers, Tendulkar induced\npanic from the first ball. Fanie de Villiers was run out going for a\nsecond run. Five from five, and last man Allan Donald to face. All he\nhad to do was take a single and give McMillan the strike. He did so,\nbut only off the penultimate ball-for three balls he swung and missed.\nThe last ball, and a boundary w;ts what South Mrica required.\nTendulkar managed to squeeze the ball between the bat and leg stump.\nAnd McMillan could get just one from the edge down the leg side as\nhe swung and failed to connect. The Indian players mobbed Tendulkar,\nhugging and kissing him as the crowd erupted with joy.\nWe had to win the match for the spectators. They cheered us\nthroughout and we owed it to them,' said Tendulkar, his voice choked\nThe One-day Phenom\n\n\n\n\fwith emotion. Watching on V in his hotel room, West Indies captain\nRichie Richardson thought Azhar had got it wrong. 'I would have\ngiven it to my best bowler. But the young fellow bowled intelligently,'\nhe said. Sachin spoke about that last over in an interview to Sportsworld\n(December ). 'Some team members had suggested I try and bowl\nleg-spin. But I decided to bowl leg cutters at military medium pace.\nThe idea was to frustrate the batsman going for a big hit, as the ball\nwouldn't come onto the bat. I only had one apprehension, that in\ntrying to restrict the batsmen I don't end up bowling a wide or a no\nball. Especially before I came in to bowl the last ball, I was ultra\ncautious. The last ball that I bowled was slightly faster. The line was\noutside the off stump. I varied my pace, to unsettle the batsman who\nwas expecting a slower delivery.'\nWest Indies brushed aside Sri Lanka in the other semi-final and\nten years after their historic World Cup encounter, it would be India v\nWest Indies again.\nThis time it was leg-spinner Ani! Kumble who emerged the hero.\nHis figures of  for  are still the best by an Indian in oms and saw\nWest Indies crumble to  in reply to India's  for . Kambli capped\na brilliant run with the top score of. Tendulkar chipped in with his\nhighest in the tournament,  not out, and then bowled Brian Lara for\n just as the West Indian batsman looked to be taking command.\nTendulkar had done enough-just about-to silence the critics who\nwere beginning to ask where his next big innings would come from.\nHe had proved his utility to the team. Still, that elusive century was\nnowhere in sight.\nThe subject of his relative lack of success 'noms was posed to him\nby a reporter with the Sportstar (  March ),just before the om\nseries in New Zealand where he opened for the first time.\n\nQ: How do you explain your failures in one-day internationals\nas opposed to your success in Test cricket? Are you aware this is\ncausing the misimpression that you have been failing in\ninternational cricket for a while now?\nA: It is very difficult to analyse why you fail in the one-day\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fgames. It is also difficult to know what you have to do when\nyou go out to the middle. You go out to bat in the th over, or\neven in the th over, and you don't know whether you have to\ngo after the bowlers or hang on there, give the strike to the set\nbatsman and play your shots later. That is what has been\nhappening to me in the one-day internationals. I have tried\nplaying shots and got out early. I have not been able to get too\nmany runs. But then I am as serious about the one-dayers as I\nam about Test cricket and so the failures are not coming from\nlack of seriousness. So, maybe, things will change with a big\ninnings or two. As far as I see it, there is nothing wrong with\nmy technique so far as one-day cricket is concerned. It is just\nthat a few failures have made it even more difficult for me.lt is\nnot as if I am getting out only in one way. Then you have to\nthink and sort out the problem. Otherwise, I feel it is quite\nokay. I know I can succeed in one-day cricket also.\nThe specific issue of his low position in the batting order was\ndiscussed in an interview (Sportsworld, December ) shortly after\nthe Hero Cup.\n\nQ: Why don't you request the captain to promote you up the\nbatting order? You could also try and do a 'Brian Lara' by\nopening the innings in one-dayers and then go in at number\nfour in Test matches?\nA: Well, I've no problems about that. Tomorrow if they tell me\nthat my opening the innings in one-dayers will help the team,\nI'll surely open. If they say 'no', I won't press for it either. I'm\nquite flexible as a cricketer.\nQ: What do you mean 'they'? You're the vice-captain of the\nside. Ifyou think by opening the innings you would be able to\nhelp the team, why aren't you suggesting that? Mter all, the\nvice-captain comprises the management.\nA: No, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to go out of my\nway. But as I told you, if they ask me to open the innings, I will.\nThe One-day Phenom\n\n\n\n\f'They' would 'ask' him soon-and in somewhat freakish\ncircumstances. The moment came in the Bank ofNew Zealand series\nof four one-day matches early in , which followed the one-off\nTest. New Zealand won the first match at Napier by  runs with\nopeners Jadeja and Sidhu putting on  runs for India. Tendulkar was\nout for . Two days later, on  March , the Indian think tank\nfaced a crisis when Sidhu woke up with a stiff neck in Auckland and\nfound himself unfit. Azharuddin explained the circumstances in his\ncolumn in the Sportstar ( February ).\nSidhu and I had gone shopping down the main street of\nAuckland the previous evening and there had been no thought\nthat a fitness problem would develop and that the extraordinary\nevent of opening with Sachin would take place. Poor Sidhu\nwoke up with a stiff neck and had to sit down and Tendulkar\ncame up and asked me whether he could try his hand at opening.\nThis was discussed at the team meetingjust before the match\nand all agreed this was well worth trying since we had to win\nthe second match to keep our chances of winning the series.\nThis is what Wadekar told me about the turn of events: 'Sachin\nand I used to talk about his opening the innings in one-dayers so that\nhe would get more overs to thrash the opposition. However, the team\nmanagement thought of not risking his wicket with the new ball as he\nwould be more useful in the middle order. When Sidhu pulled out,\nthe three of us-Azhar as captain, Kapil Dev as a senior member and\nmyself-had an emergency meeting on the ground before the toss\nand when I told them that Sachin would not mind opening, they\nagreed willingly. Sachinjumped in the air with joy and celebrated his\npromotion to the opening slot with a swashbuckling innings. Thus a\nstar opening batsman was born for India in ODis.'\nAnd how! It was Tendulkar's seventieth ODI and one that would\nchange the face of modern cricket. This is how New Zealand selector\nand journalist Don Neely recalls the match and Tendulkar's innings:\n\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fNew Zealand made a dismal  and in the course of .\novers only managed to hit  fours and one six. There was a\nsurprise for the spectators who had almost been comatose by\nthe local batting.\nJadeja's partner was Tendulkar. The young man played shots\nof technical excellence and plundered the attack. The Indian\n was posted in . overs, the  in .. An experienced\ngroup ofbowlers was exposed as being good at containing most\nbatsmen but powerless to curb the brilliance of the young Indian.\nHis innings of consisted ofjust  scoring shots and he was\nback in the pavilion in  minutes and the game was over with\n. overs to spare.\nNo one who witnessed the batting ofTendulkar that day will\never forget it. He was calm while all around him was in chaos.\nHe was composed, fast on his feet, a master batsman displaying\nhis wares. There were no crude, innovative creations. Just\ntextbook perfection. Power came from sublime timing.\nThe effect on followers in New Zealand was that the grounds\nwere almost full before the toss was made. No spectator wanted\nto run the risk of arriving at the ground late and missing\nTendulkar.\nAs he has done repeatedly since then Tendulkar has shown\nthat in both forms of the game he is an exceptional batsman.\nOne innings of such class is burned into the memory banks, to\nbe replayed at will for the rest of one's life.\nIn the batsman's own words in the Sportstar ( December ), 'I\nthought I could play a few lofted shots and scatter the field. Mentally,\nI was prepared to go for the bowling. I waited for the first three or four\novers. I realized the onus was on me and Ajay Jadeja to give a good\nstart. I gauged the bowling, gained in confidence. I started striking the\nball very well. The rest happened automatically.'\nWhat happened 'automatically' was the decimation of the Kiwi\nattack consisting.ofDanny Morrison, Chris Pringle, Gavin Larsen,\nMatthew Hart and Chris Harris. The most experienced of the lot,\nThe One-day Phenom\n\n\n\n\fMorrison, was singled out for special treatment and smashed for five\nimperious boundaries. At Napier, in the first om two days earlier, he\nhad taken New Zealand's first om hat-trick. Now he was carted for \nruns from six overs. 'It was pleasing to get runs off Morrison. But\nactually the Kiwis bowled the way I expected them to. I was picking\nthe line easily. It was sheer instinct.' In panic and not knowing where\nto pitch the ball, Morrison bowled a bouncer so high that it went way\nover Tendulkar's head.lt was done deliberately to deny him the chance\nof making contact, such was the bowler's desperation.\nLarsen was considered the tightest of the Kiwi bowlers. He was\ntaken off after two overs which cost him  runs, including two sixes.\nThe opening stand with Jadeja was worth  runs-Jadeja's\ncontribution was . The  came up in an amazing . overs. 'The\ncaptain and the manager had said the score should be  by the th\nover. I said, \"Fair enough. We will try and do it.\" I still remember\nwhen the score reached , it was . overs. It was quite satisfying.'\nThe target of  was now a mere formality. The only question\nwas whether Azharuddin's world record of the quickest om centuryoff  balls against New Zealand at Baroda in -would be beaten.\nTendulkar raced to  from  balls ( scoring shots) before being\ncaught by skipper Ken Rutherford off Pringle. Rutherford was the\nfirst to applaud-perhaps as much in relief as in awe-as the crowd\nrose in tribute to one of the great om innings. 'I was thinking about a\nhundred, but it didn't matter. The team won, that's more important.\nTo me the team always comes first.' Once again, Vinod Kambli was\nwitness to the fireworks from the other end. The two had added  for\nthe second wicket. This was the sequence of scoring shots: , , , , ,\n, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . Even umpires Brian Aldridge\nand Chris Kingjoined in the applause from the crowd and the New\nZealand players.\nSeven years later, in April, after becoming the first player to\ncross , ODI runs, Sachin was asked by Vijay Lokapally of the\nSportstar about the thrust his career had got after opening the innings.\n'It was a big change,' Tendulkar said. 'Batting at number six I thought\nI wasn't getting enough opportunities. I was capable of delivering\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fmore than I was doing at that time, batting so low in the order.\nSomething inside me would always tell me that I was cut out to bat\nhigher in the order to be able to give more and more to the team.'\nThe series was drawn -. In the next game at Wellington, India\nwon by  runs and once again, the openers did their job admirably.\nJadeja () and Tendulkar () put on . There was an opening\nstand of in the final game at Christchurch, which the home side\nwon by six wickets. The series was levelled, but the gain for the Indian\nteam was immeasurable.\nThe hectic schedule of the team took them to Sharjah less than a\nfortnight after the one-day series had ended in New Zealand. The sixnation Austral-Asia Cup was an opportunity for Tendulkar to test his\nnew found skills as opener against the formidable bowling attacks of\nPakistan and Australia. New Zealand, Sri Lanka and the UAE were the\nother teams in the fray.\nThe opening match between India and the UAE was their maiden\nOne-day International. In the course of his , Tendulkar broke\nanother record: he became the youngest player to make  om\nruns.\nIndia had stayed away from Sharjah for nearly three years for a\nvariety of reasons. The India-Pakistan match was, therefore, more\neagerly anticipated than ever.\nTendulkar gave India a blazing start. He raced to his  from just\n deliveries, and after the match Pakistani captain Salim Malik\nconceded that he had been worried India would reach -plus, the\nway the top order went for the bowling. In the end, they could only get\nto , which was hardly a challenge for the strong Pakistani batting\nline-up. As he had done just a couple of weeks earlier, Jadeja was\ncontent to watch from the other end as Tendulkar went at the bowlers\nhammer and tongs. His contribution in a stand of  was just .\nEven the pro-Pakistani sections of the crowd cheered Sachin's\naudacious stroke play. He hit ten fours and three sixes, one of which,\noffWasim Akram, was a real beauty. The ball was picked clean from\nthe middle stump and sent soaring over midwicket. Even Akram had\nThe One-day Phenom\n\n\n\n\fto confess: 'It was stunning.' Rarely had an Indian batsman treated the\nPakistani bowling with such contemptuous ease. But just when he\nwas beginning to look unstoppable, a careless shot brought the\nentertainment to an end. In off-spinner Akram Raza's first over, Sachin\ntried to hoist him over midwicket only to present a catch to Basit Ali in\nthe deep. He was out for  from  deliveries. It was Raza's only\nwicket in the match, but what a vital one!\nWith Sidhu and Azhar following Sachin's cue, India were well\nplaced at  for  when wickets began to fall in a heap. Pakistan\neventually cantered home by six wickets.\nIn the semi-final against Australia, Tendulkar was dismissed\ncheaply by Glenn McGrath, though India won by seven wickets.\nWith Pakistan beating New Zealand by  runs in the other semifinal,\nit was once again an India-Pakistan final, just what the organizers and\nfans had hoped for. The Pakistanis took  in their innings, a total\nwhich could have been overhauled easily if the Indians had received\nanother good start fromJadeja and Tendulkar. It was not to be. Akram\nremovedJadeja for a duck and then Ata-ur-Rehman struck the vital\nblow when he had Tendulkar caught by Aamir So hail from a full toss\nfor . Kambli's  was the top score as \u00b7Pakistan completed their\ntwelfth win over India in  matches in Sharjah, to win the title for\nthe third time running. Tendulkar's position at the top of the batting\norder was, however, cemented by now.\nBut when would that elusive century finally arrive?\nThe answer came on  September  at the R.Premadasa\nStadium at Khettarama in Colombo. The Singer Cup was the first\nmajor one-day tournament to be staged in Sri Lanka, the hosts\ncompeting with India, Australia and Pakistan for the top prize. The\ntournament was badly hit by rain with a number of matches being\ncancelled, postponed or curtailed. The players spent long periods\ncooped up in their Colombo hotel. Perhaps this gave them ample\ntime to indulge in non-cricketing activity. For, as the murky matchfixing saga unfolded over the years, events off the field in the Singer\nCup would acquire notoriety.\nMter losing the opening match to Sri Lanka by seven wickets,\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fIndia were desperately looking for a win to keep their hopes alive\nwhen they met Australia. This was Tendulkar's seventy-eighth ODI.\nHis record before the match stood at  runs from  innings (nine\nnot out) at .--useful rather than world-class. The day-night game\nat Colombo would change all that.\nIndia's opening match had been reduced to  overs because of\nrain. Wadekar was confident his boys would prove their worth if given\nthe full quota. He was proved right as India won against Australia by\n runs. Tendulkar had a new opening partner in the tournament in\nall-rounder Manoj Prabhakar. Their stand was worth  and India's\ntotal of for  was built on Tendulkar's . Craig McDermott,\nGlenn McGrath and Shane Warne were at their wits' end on where to\npitch the ball. Good deliveries as well as bad were treated with equal\ncontempt as Tendulkar launched an attack on Warne that saw him go\nfor  runs from his ten overs. Repeatedly, he hit over the top and\nthrough the line and when he reached three figures, the Australians\njoined in the applause. He raced to  from  balls, but slowed down\na little after that, once the century was in his sights.\nThe sight of non-striker Vinod Kambli ( not out) embracing his\nfriend on reaching the long-awaited ton was a sight to warm every\nIndian heart. 'It came a little late but I am glad to have got over that\nmental pressure of not having achieved the distinction,' said the\nrelieved Man of the Match. India went on to win. the rain-reduced\nfinal against Sri Lanka, though Tendulkar was out for a duck.\nFrom October  following the Singer Cup to December ,\nTendulkar played in all oflndia's  one-day games. Only in one of\nthese did he not open. The  innings brought him  runs at an\naverage of , with three more centuries and five s as well.\nThe one-day phenomenon had arrived.\n\nThe One-day Phenom\n\n\n\n The Brian and Sachin Show\n\nI hate comparisons.-Sachin Tendulkar\nSachin Tendulkar hates comparisons. He has made this clear in\ninterview after interview. Indeed, these comparisons-often\nridiculous-have been made ever since his school days. In , when\nSir Donald Bradman created a sensation in the Indian media by going\non record that the Indian master's batting reminded him ofhis own,\nTendulkar was honoured. But even then he protested, saying Sir Don\nwas being 'unfair' in making the comparison. Among his\ncontemporaries, comparisons have most frequently been made\nbetween Tendulkar and the West Indian batting genius, Brian Lara.\nLara is a left-hander. But since the s, the Indian and the West\nIndian have emerged as the greatest batsmen of their generation, good\nenough to be part of many all-time World XIs. Even as this chapter\nwas being written, Lara scored his sixteenth century in his eighty-first\nTest, at Galle, Sri Lanka. It was his first Test century in  months. In\nthe third and final Test of the series at Colombo, he scored  and\n, and finished the series with an astonishing  runs (average\n.)-a record-breaking. per cent ofhis team's total aggregate\nand the second highest for a three-Test series. Yet, the West Indies were\nbeaten -. Mter the series, champion Sri Lankan off-spinner Muthiah\nMuralitharan was quoted as saying he found it more difficult to bowl\nto Lara than Tendulkar. 'Lara and Tendulkar are the hardest batsmen\nto bowl against, but the West Indian has troubled me more. Tendulkar\nis positive and difficult to bowl against, but I have an advantage over\nhim because he is a right-hander. I have been working hard against\n\n\fIeft-handers. Part of the problem is I am turning the ball too much\nand find it difficult to get leg-before decisions.\n'Lara is a wonderful player. He can play all shots. Most batsmen\nare restricted in some way and, as a bowler, you can focus on their\nweak points. But he can do anything-cut, late-cut, drive, sweep and\nthe lofted drive. When you are playing a good bowler, you have to be\npatient and pick the right ball to hit and Lara does that well. We had a\nreally good battle. I won it twice, but he was the winner most of the\ntime.'\nSadly for Lara, the tour ended prematurely, following a dislocated\nelbow during a one-day game (followed by more girlfriend troubles\nback home). He became only the sixth batsman to score a double\ncentury and a century in the same Test (Graham Gooch had made a\ntriple century and a century). Still, he has a long way to go to catch up\nwith Tendulkar's current record and has rapidly fallen behind after\nhis golden year of . A Test average in the s at his peak had\nslipped below  by mid , and only the wonderful run of scores in\nSri Lanka pushed it marginally past . In , Lara scored  runs\nat . while Tendulkar's figures were  runs at .; in  it\nwas  at  ( at . for Tendulkar); in  Lara's  runs\nwere scored at an average of. compared to Tendulkar's  at\n. In  the comparative figures were: Tendulkar:  runs at\n.; Lara:  at .; and in  Lara had  runs at .\nwhile Tendulkar's record was  at ..\nLara tends to skip tours with alarming frequency on the flimsiest\nof grounds. The most recent instance was the tour to Zimbabwe and\nKenya in  from which he made a late withdrawal, ostensibly due\nto an injury.\nIn the fifth Test against England at St. John's, Antigua in April\n, amidst scenes of unprecedented jubilation, Lara broke the world\nTest record of fellow West Indian Sir Garfield Sobers. The record\nindividual score of not out had been set in . Now Lara eclipsed\nit with a powerful innings of. Then, inside of SO days, he broke the\n-run barrier for the first time in the history of first-class cricket\nwith an astounding innings of  not out for Warwickshire against\nThe Brian and Sachin Show\n\n\n\n\fDurham at Edgbaston in the English county championship. It made\nLara the first batsman after Bradman to simultaneously hold the record\nfor the highest Test and first-class score. Suddenly the Prince of\nTrinidad was being proclaimed the king of cricket. And the cricket\nworld had eyes for only one man.\nLara had first announced himself with a sublime innings of\n(run out) against Australia at Sydney in December , his maiden\nTest century. Tendulkar, it may be recalled, had taken more than ten\nyears to score his first double century. The Trinidadian's appetite for\nmassive scores appeared insatiable while Tendulkar's seeming\nimpatience at the crease saw him fai.J to build on his centuries.\nLara is four years older than Tendulkar. He made his debut a year\nlater (), also in Pakistan. But it took him two years to establish\nhimself in the West Indian team. No cricketer before or since has\nenjoyed as spectacular a year as Lara did in . It not only brought\nhim tons of runs and records galore, but also fame and wealth the likes\nof which cricket had rarely seen. Sponsors lined up to sign up the\nmaster batsman and, back home in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, the\ngovernment gifted him a vast plot ofland to build a house for himself\nand his family, It was the stuff of fairy tales, the classic rags to riches\nstory. But how lorigwould it last?\nA friend warned Lara in  that his troubles were just beginning.\nThe prediction turned out to be spot on. Just a year later, the pressure\nproved too much. Lara announced his retirement, walked out of the\ntour of England and told manager Wes Hall: 'Cricket is ruining my\nlife.' It was a startling confession. He was .persuaded to return, but was\nfined ten per cent ofhis fees at the end of the tour, and he pulled out of\nthe tour to Australia later in the year in protest. It was dunng that\nseries in England in  when things were spiralling downwards\nthat Curtly Ambrose bluntly told the star batsman at a team meeting:\n'It seems like you don't want to bat long again. Where is the hunger,\nwill and determination? They cannot get you out unless you get\nyourself out. You are not the same man, so get hungry.' He showed his\nhunger after that with Test scores of, , ,  and . Mter\nbeing dismissed for a pair by a part-time bowler against Kent in one of\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe touring team's warm-up matches, he railed, 'Everyone expects me\nto go out and at least get close to breaking those records every time I\nbat.' Such is the price of fame. At various times Lara has consulted\npsychiatrists in a bid to overcome his demons, and in conversation\nwith former England captain Mike Brearley in , he complained\nof'frustration, and mental and physical tiredness'.\nThere were more troubles ahead after the West Indies were edged\nout of the  World Cup semi-finals by Australia. The West Indies\nCricket Board reprimanded Lara after several verbal outbursts by him.\nBy now, he had made it clear to one and all that he was determined to\nbe captain of the West Indies and that he would allow nothing and\nnobody to get in his way. Lara did get his chance in the Barbados Test\nagainst India in March . With Walsh injured, he led the team\nastutely to a thrilling victory. Leading India was Tendulkar. But the\u00b7\nWest Indian authorities appeared in no hurry to make Lara's\nappointment a formal one. That decision was finally made for the\nhome series against England in . Things seemed to be looking\nup as the West Indies won the Tests - and the ODI series -.\nBut the fall from grace was to come a year later, in South Mrica.\nLara led a pay dispute by the team that saw him stripped ofhis captaincy,\nonly to get it back once the matter was resolved. The West Indies were\nhumiliated on their first tour ofSouth Mrica, crushed - in the Test\nseries and - in the oms. Now he was living on borrowed time. He\nwas retained for the home series against Australia in  after being\ncastigated by the Board for his 'weakness in leadership', and placed on\nprobation as captain for the first two Tests.\nWhat happened next was one of the greatest turnarounds in sporting\nhistory. Bowled out by Australia for an all-time low of  and crushed\nby  runs in the first Test, the end appeared near for the West Indies\nand not for the last time either. Lara had not scored a century in \nTests. In the next three he would reel off three. Two of them- and\n not out-inspired amazing victories. The third,  in Antigua\nin the final Test, could not prevent Australia from levelling the series.\nBut single-handedly, Lara had restored the pride ofWest Indian cricket,\nand his own reputation in the bargain, with his breathtaking batting.\nThe Brian and Sachin Show\n\n\n\n\fThe downslide, however, came back to haunt the team as they crashed\nout in the league stage of the  World Cup. Both Tests and all five\noms were surrendered in New Zealand. And on  February ,\nLara submitted his resignation from the captaincy as he took another\nbreak from cricket. It had become too much. Back home in India\naround the same time, Tendulkar too resigned from the captaincy that\nhad been thrust on him for the second time, late in . The pressure\non the two superstars was having its effect.\nThe similarity, however, ends there. Lara lacked the comfort of a\nstable family life, which has benefited Tendulkar so much, and given\nhim much needed peace of mind. Lara's father, who was an early\ninfluence, died before he made his Test debut. Lara did have a daughter\nfrom his girlfriend in , but they have since parted ways. In\nAustralia, during the - season, he was accused of spending\nmore time with an -year-old English model (who has since moved\nin with him) than on his cricket. Golf, too, had become an obsession,\ndistracting him from cricket.\nAlmost every current and ex-cricketer ranks Tendulkar above Lara\nin contemporary cricket, though as we have seen, it was not always\nthat way. Allan Donald, for one, thought that Tendulkar was in a\ndifferent class to Lara as a professional cricketer. He was a model\ncricketer, and despite the intolerable pressures he faced back home in\nIndia, remained a really nice guy. He also considered Tendulkar the\nbest batsman in the world, pulling away from Brian Lara every year.\nWriting in Sportsworld (May ), 'Tiger' Pataudi commented:\n'Tendulkar, I reckon is even more talented than Lara, but he is yet to\ndevelop the latter's temperament and so often pleases to tease.' And in\nGefrey Boycott on Cricket: 'The way in which he [Tendulkar] reacted\n[to losing the captaincy in ] at a time of great stress illustrates the\ndifference between Tendulkar, who did not cause a moment's fuss or\ntrouble, and the petulant Lara. The product of a careful upbringing in\nIndia, Tendulkar, despite his superstar status, simply refused to waste\nhis time in altercations with the Indian board and selectors.' And finally,\nSir Donald Bradman in Roland Perry's Bradman's Best: 'Lara and\nTendulkar have proved to be the two best batsmen in the s.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar has a very strong defence. He's very tight. But he can be\naggressive, as he showed in that one-day series against Australia early\nin  and in the Tests in India. On balance, however, Lara has\nprobably proved more aggressive, though more mercurial. Tendulkar\nis proving more consistent.'\nAs though to clinch the issue, Tendulkar was the only\ncontemporary cricketer to find a place in Sir Dan's controversial\n'Dream Team' released by Perry shortly after the legend's death in\nFebruary .\nLara and Tendulkar came face to face in a Test series for the first\ntime when West Indies toured India late in  under Walsh's\ncaptaincy. The three-Test series was drawn -. But Tendulkar certainly\nhad the better of the exchanges, averaging double that of Lara ( to\n), with a century and two half-centuries. Lara had two s with a top\nscore of  in the third Test at Mohali, which West Indies won to\nsquare the series. The tour was the first for Lara following his twin\nworld records. But it turned out to be something of a nightmare both\non and off the field. He failed to register a century in either the Tests,\nthe first-class tour matches or the numerous ODIS. And he was\nsuspended for one  by match referee Raman Subba Row. This\nfollowed his request to the umpire to consult the replays after being\ngiven out stumped against New Zealand in the Wills World Series\nmatch at Margao.\nBefore the series against the West Indies, it was Sri Lanka's turn to be\nflattened by the Indian steamroller early in , losing all three Tests\nby an innings. It was another whitewash by Azhar and his merry\nmen-on home soil, that is. The series was notable for Kapil Dev first\nequalling and then overtaking Sir Richard Hadlee's world Test record\nof  wickets. The onslaught began at Lucknow. Opener Sidhu\nbattered the Sri Lankan bowlers as he smashed eight sixes in his .\nBut it was Tendulkar's  that was a class apart.\n'Sidhu helped me a lot,' said Tendulkar after his seventh Test\ncentury. 'He smashed the bowlers and that gave me enough insight\ninto the bowling. I was under a bit of pressure because the Sri Lankans\nThe Brian and Sachin Show\n\nIll\n\n\fconcentrated on getting me out.' Poised at  at the end of the first day,\nSachin reached his ton the next morning from just four balls from\nmedium-pacer Pramodya Wickramasinghe. The century came with\ntwo cover drives. He admitted the  had been on his mind when he\nresumed his innings with Azhar for company.\nThe West Indies under Walsh wete expected to give India a run for\ntheir money in the winter of . India had not lost a series at home\nsince ; West Indies had not lost a series anywhere for  years.\nUltimately, both sides kept their records intact. Indian cricket fans\nwere also keen to see world record holder Lara in action. But as\nmentioned earlier, he was a major disappointment. The first Test at\nMumbai was played on a pitch of such variable bounce that the West\nIndies batsmen used chest pads even while facing the spinners. It was\ntenacious batting in both innings by the Indians and an outstanding\nspell of fast bowling in the second by Srinath that swung the match\nIndia's way. Victory early on the fifth morning was the tenth for\nAzharuddin, a record for an Indian captain. But the margin of runs\nwas deceptive; the finish was actually quite tight.\nWalsh and Benjamin got an alarming lift on the first day and the\nscore of for  would have been even more disastrous but for plucky\nbatting by Kambli () and Tendulkar (). Both Prabhakar and\nAzharuddin failed to score. Wicketkeeper NayanMongia () was\nthe utdikely top scorer and his sixth-wicket stand of  with\nManjrekar () took India to the respectable total of. Left-arm\nspinner Raju then picked up five wickets to give India a kad of \nruns. This was nullified, however, by the end of the second day when\nIndia were reduced to  for , Benjamin bowling with real fire.\nThere was a delay of  minutes to the start of the third day due to\ndamp patches near the bowling crease. This allowed the sting to be\ndrawn from the wicket, and that was all the Indian batsmen needed.\nSidhu and Azhar failed for the second time, making it  for . But as\nthe day wore on, the pitch eased out and the Mumbai pair ofManjrekar\nand Tendulkar took the game away from the West Indies. Tendulkar's\n (he was the joint top scorer in the Test with Junior Murray) was a\nperfect blend of attack and defence, while Manjrekar came up with his\nIll\n\nSachin\n\n\fsecond  of the match. Tendulkar straight drove Walsh and worked\nhim off his pads for fours and then forced the removal ofleg-spinner\nDhanraj, hitting him for a six over long on and a four over mid-off.\nBoth the batsmen looked in total control as they added  for the sixth\nwicket before they fell to attacking shots. Tendulkar's  came from\n balls before he sliced an offbreak from Hooper to be caught behind.\nThe tail wagged furiously with Kumble () and Srinath () flogging\nthe bowling. The target for the West Indies () was beyond their\nreach, and Srinath finished with  for  and the Man of the Match\naward.\nIndia's safety-first approach possibly cost them the second Test at\nNagpur and a series victory. The West Indies, let off the hook then,\nstaged a fightback at Mohali in the third and final Test to salvage their\npride and unbeaten record. Nagpur saw Tendulkar score his first\ncentury against the West Indies as India built up a formidable  for\n declared and claimed a first innings lead of  runs. He added \nfor the third wicket with Sidhu and a further  with Azhar () for\nthe fifth. But India consumed nearly two full days in compiling their\nhuge score.\n'I gained in confidence watching Sachin bat,' said Sidhu. 'I consider\nhim as the living legend. I am his fan. It helps batting with Sachin.'\nThis was Sidhu's sixth century, and in the last four he had been joined\non three figures by Tendulkar. The two were proving to be India's\nbatting mainstays. Tendulkar had come off two ducks in a row at\nFaridabad and Mumbai in the one-day series and had been feeling the\npressure. He was delighted with his century and for once showed\nemotion by leaping and pumping his fist in the air when he got to\nthree figures-going from  to  with a hooked six offWalsh. But\nhe was disappointed at missing his first Test double century, out for\n. Now that his first  century was behind him, this was a fresh\nlandmark preying on his mind. 'People forget easily, but not me. It's in\nthe back of my mind. But I have an extremely positive mind.'\nSidhu and Tendulkar wrested control of the West Indies' attack\nafter off-spinner Carl Hooper had got rid of Prabhakar and Kambli\ncheaply. Tendulkar's back-foot shots went like bullets, as did his straight\nThe Brian and Sachin Show\n\nIll\n\n\fdrives. So good was his timing and so powerful his shots that a rare\ndefensive stroke offWalsh bounced over fielder Benjamin and raced\nto the fence. The double century partnership with his captain was the\nfirst over  in which Tendulkar was associated. The  was his\nhighest Test score till then and it took a brilliant, diving catch by Lara\nat mid wicket offWalsh to terminate it; he faced  balls and hit \nfours and a six. But the overcautious Indian batting in the second\ninnings and a late declaration allowed the visitors to escape. There\nwas another century stand between Sidhu () and Tendulkar () in\nthe second innings, for the third wicket. Dut this time the runs came at\na much slower pace even as the Windies' bowlers slowed down the\nover rate. The declaration when it came on the final day allowed the\nIndian bowlers just four hours-in which they grabbed five wickets.\nThe West Indies stormed back to take the third Test at Mohali and\ndraw the series. Walsh and Benjamin unleashed a barrage of hostile\nbowling to which the Indian batting had no answer, particularly on\nthe final day when they collapsed for . Adams was the batting hero\nand the Man of the Series. But it was their furious fast bowling that\nhad once again won the day for the visitors. The West Indies had a first\ninnings lead of . The Indian innings was marked by a maiden\ncentury by Manoj Prabhakar. Manjrekar and Tendulkar both chipped\nin with  while Srinath () was once again a revelation with the bat.\nLara () in the role of opener finally sparkled in the second innings\nwhen his team was looking for quick runs. He took four fours off a\nSrinath over. But just when he seemed set to reach his first century in\nthe subcontinent, he walked after nicking the ball to the keeper. His\ngesture came in for plenty of praise after what had been a taxing tour\nfor the entire team.\nThe target of was quite beyond India's reach and they lost both\nopeners on the fourth evening. Prabhakar was taken offbleeding after\nbeing hit on the mouth by Walsh before he had opened his account,\nwhile Sidhu was out for . The fifth day collapse was spectacular.\nSeven wickets tumbled in the first ten overs and the match was over\nfive minutes before lunch. India looked to Tendulkar, as usual. But he\nplayed a loose cover drive after a deliberate field change by Walsh for\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fBenjamin. The air of invincibility surroundingAzhar's boys at home\nhad been blown away. The disappointment of the Test series was offset\nto some extent by winning both the ODI tri-series (New Zealand were\nthe third team) and the one-day series against the West Indies, that too\nby a convincing - margin. The two series were played\nsimultaneously.\nTendulkar started off the  series against the West Indies with\ntwo successive ducks. But he followed up those failures with scores of\n, and  (atJaipur). There was also a century at Baroda against\nNew Zealand in the Wills World Series. In the final against West\nIndies at Calcutta, Man of the Match Tendulkar was top scorer with\n and returned figures of for  from eight overs as India won by \nruns.\nLara and Tendulkar came head-to-head again in the Carribean in\n. The media was rife with comparisons once again, just before\nthe series. West Indies captain Carl Hooper admitted the pressure got\nthe better of Lara in the second Test which India won.\nThere was rare success for India in Sharjah in April . Despite\nlosing once again to Pakistan, they made it to the final thanks to an\nupset win by Sri Lanka over the Pakistanis. Tendulkar scored his fourth\nODI century of the - season in the league game against Sri\nLanka which India won by eight wickets. In the process, he became\nthe youngest to cross  ODI runs. The margin of victory was\nrepeated in the final, though this time Tendulkar's score was .\nMeanwhile, back home Tendulkar had been appointed captain of\nMumbai for the - Ranji Trophy season, and it turned out to be\na season of triumph for both the team and the captain, culminating in\na century in both innings in the final against Punjab. The first-innings\ncentury was reached in  balls, the second from a mere ---the\nfourth fastest in Ranji history. (The next season he would score the\nfastest century in domestic one-day cricket-from  balls for Wills\nXI in the Wills Trophy quarter-final against Hyderabad in Rajkot.) In\nthe five Ranji matches that season (seven innings) he had  runs\nwith five centuries at .. It was not just the bulk of runs but the\nThe Brian and Sachin Show\n\n\n\n\fferocious rate at which they were scored that was amazing. Those \nruns were scored from S balls with  sixes and  fours. Mumbai\nhad won all their West Zone league matches for the first time in \nyears. At , Sachin. became the youngest captain to win the Ranji\ntitle in the history of the championship.\nTendulkar had been away inN ew Zealand when Mumbai regained\nthe Ranji Trophy after a gap of ten years in . So, being part of a\nwinning Mumbai team was special for him. Before the Ranji Trophy\ntriumph, Mumbai had also won the Wills Trophy limited-overs\ntournament. Tendulkar scored  in the final against Haryana, which\nMumbai won by nine wickets. Chasing a total of  in  overs,\nMumbai reached the target in . overs. Apart from  runs in the\nRanji Trophy that year, he had struck his first ODI century as well as\ntons against New Zealand at Baroda, West Indies atJaipur and against\nSri Lanka in the Asia Cup in Sharjah. The Wills Trophy saw him\nscore  and  for Mumbai. He had  runs in the Wills World\nSeries,  in the Pepsi one-day series against the West Indies and \nruns in three Tests against the same team. No wonder he told Vijay\nLokapally (Sportstar,  May ) that it was his 'best season'.\nThe key to his new found success in oms was, ofcourse, the decision\nto open the innings. No longer would he be left with less than ten\novers in the middle order. A~ he said in that interview to the Sportstar (\nMay ): 'I was happy the way I performed in Tests and one-day\nmatches. There was much to learn and I was really satisfied that there\nwere occasions when I lived up to the expectations of my teammates.\nMy overall performance was better and I think I improved technically\nas a batsman.'\nAll those runs and tons gave a huge boost to the Indian side. They\nstarted the season by winning the Singer Cup in Sri Lanka in\nSeptember  and ended it with the triumph in the Asia Cup in\nSharjah in April . At home, the West Indies were beaten - in\nthe  series, and India also won the Wills World Series triangular\ntournament. For Sachin, it was a memorable year: his first  century,\nfirst Ranji Trophy triumph, first century against the West Indies, the\nAsia Cup ... and there would be one more, even more cherished\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fmoment.\nOn  May , at the Jewel oflndia hall in Mumbai, Sachin\nmarried Dr Anjali Mehta, a paediatrician whom he had been dating\nsince . She was five years older than him. The wedding and\nnumerous receptions that followed had all ofMumbai agog. Star TV\noffered him a huge amount to telecast the marriage live. But Sachin\nflatly turned them down. Other TV crews were turned away at the\nvenue of the wedding. As always, he drew a very firm line between his\npersonal and professional life. It took a great deal of persuasion from\none of Mumbai's senior sports journalists before he allowed\nphotographers a brief session on the lawns of the hotel, with the bride,\nfollowing the wedding ceremony. Naturally, the city's cricket fraternity\nas well as politicians and film stars were present at the celebrations.\nEx-Yorkshire captain Phil Carrick represented Sachin's old county\nteam at the wedding. This is what he told Scyld Berry ofWisden Cricket\nMonthly une ): 'It was the nearest I'll ever get to going to a royal\nwedding. There were banners and neon signs saying congratulations\nto Sachin and Anjali. The wedding itself was for only a few close\nfriends and relatives, but there were about seven receptions and there\nmust have been a thousand at the one I went to on a hotel rooftop.'\nThere was to be another landmark in Tendulkar's life that year. In\nNovember he signed a five-year deal with Mark Mascarenhas's\nWorldTel for an astronomical sum.\n\nThe Brian and Sachin Show\n\n World Cup -and England Again\n\nHe plays much the same as I played.-Sir Donald Bradman\nThe World Cup returned to Asia in , a decade after the Reliance\nWorld Cup, and as in , under stormy circumstances. India,\nPakistan and Sri Lanka won the right to co-host the sixth edition in\nthe face of fierce opposition from England. Then, on the eve of\ncricket's mega event, terrorist bombs struck in the heart of Colombo,\nand Australia and West Indies refused to play their Group A matches\nin Sri Lanka due to security concerns. But it turned out to be another\nmagn.ificent tournament, nonetheless, won in grand style by the Sri\nLankans who defeated Australia in the final at Lahore. For the first\ntime there was a quarter-final stage, though with only  teams in the\nfray there was not much doubt as to which eight teams would qualify\nfor the two groups.\nIndia were once again led by Azharuddin. Their batting challenge\nwas now firmly in the hands ofSachin Tendulkar who had matured\nfrom 'promising' prior to the  World Cup, to one of the best\nbatsmen in the world four years later. This, despite struggling in the\nrun-up to the World Cup. The home series against New Zealand, late\nin , had been bedevilled by rain. India had won the three-Test\nseries - with precious little play possible in the second and third\nTests. Tcndulkar's scores of ,  (not out),  (not out) and  were\ndisappointing. The inexperienced Kiwis ran the hosts close in the\none-day series that followed, losing -. Here again, Tendulkar failed\nto fire, and ended with just one half-century. A total of  runs from\nfive innings as opener forced him to rethink some aspects of his\n\n\ftechnique. There were a few months between the series and the World\nCup which enabled him to iron out the technical flaws which had\ncrept into his batting. 'Mine is a floating technique,' he commented\nafter the lean patch. 'Sometimes the balance of the body weight is on\nthe front foot and sometimes on the back foot. But I knew all I needed\nwas one big innings to sort things out.'\nThat innings came in India's opening World Cup tie against Kenya\nat Cuttack; he was  not out, at nearly a run a ball. India, needing\n to win, coasted to victory with seven wickets to spare after\nTendulkar's opening stand of  with Ajay Jadeja. It was his maiden\nWorld Cup  and won him the Man of the Match award.\nIndia's first big test would come three days later, at Gwalior,\nwhere they met the West Indies, champions in  and  but by\nnow in rapid decline. For the first time, the Indian team was being\nseen as a 'one-man army'-uncharitable though this was to\nTendulkar's talented teammates. But it was true that for Indian fans,\nSachin was the main event. Inevitably, the rnatch was seen as a\nTendulkar v Lara clash.\nIn the event, it was a no-contest. Not only did India maintain their\nrecent supremacy over the twice-world champions by winning by\nfive wickets, but Tendulkar also outshone his famed rival. The scores:\nLara-; Tendulkar-.\nIt was a far from blemish less knock, though. Chasing Windies'\n, India lost two early wickets and it could so easily have been three:\nTendulkar was dropped at square leg when on , and then on  in\nthe tenth over. His skied leg side shot hovered in the air for ages before\nwicketkeeper Browne floored the sitter. The roar of relief from the\ncrowd must have rocked the nearby fort. Had the catch been held,\nIndia would have sunk to  for . It was the slice of luck the side\ndesperately needed and after that, the West Indies were shut out of the\ngame. Tendulkar slammed  for the third wicket with Azhar in \novers and then added  with Vinod Kambli before being run out for\n after a mix-up with his chum. By then, India wen: comfortably\nplaced at  for  and the Man of the Match award was Sachin's\nagain.\nWorld Cup -and England Again\n\n\n\n\fIt was two weeks before the World Cup came up with its first classic\nmatch. The India-Australia World Cup encounters had gone down to\nthe wire both in  at Chennai and in  at Brisbane. The match\nin Mumbai on  February did not quite produce such thrills. But the\ncricket played by both sides was out of the top draw. If India v West\nIndies was billed as Tendulkar v Lara, this one was the TendulkarWarnc show. This time Sachin won the individual honours against\nthe leg-spinner. But he was outshone by Mark Waugh and the\nAustralians who won the contest by  runs.\nIt was Mumbai's first floodlit match and it was a privilege to watch\nthe classic from the Wankhede Stadium press box. Australia won the\ntoss and were into their stride right away with an opening stand worth\n between captain Mark Taylor and Mark Waugh. The total of\nwas challenging, though it might have been much more but for a\ncollapse which saw the last seven wickets fall for  runs. Waugh's \nfollowed on from his  against Kenya four days earlier, making him\nthe first batsman to make back-to-back centuries in the World Cup.\nEven though it came at virtually a run a ball, there was never the\nslightest hint of a slog in his imperious innings, It was all wristy stroke\nplay and even the , partisans in the stadium could not fail to\nappreciate its quality.\nThe contrast between Waugh and Tendulkar could not have been\ngreater. WithJadeja and Kambli sent back for next to nothing, a sense\nof desperation crept into the Indian master's batting. The result was\nbatting which was not exactly crude, but certainly brutal. Faced with a\nbig target, Tendulkar decided to chance his arm and play some\naudacious shots. It was not pretty in the way Waugh's innings was, but\nunder the trying circumstances, it was perhaps the only method\navailable. Especially since the top Indian order, with the exception of\nSanjay Manjrekar (), was fast crumbling in the face of Damien\nFleming's accuracy and aggression. McGrath missed a tough caughtand-bowled chance and was promptly carted for  runs from two\novers. There were a couple of other half-chances too, and some wild\nshots which stayed in the air but landed safely. The Mumbai boy was\nliving dangerously, willing to take risks in a desperate bid for victory.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fIt was a magnificent spectacle under the lights and the crowd was\nin a frenzy. It seemed only Sachin could save India as he raced to his\n from  balls. He jumped from  to  offjust  breathtaking\nballs-it all appeared to be happening in the blink of an eye, so surreal\nwas the atmosphere. Warne's very first delivery was hit straight and\nhard for six and suddenly Tendulkar was on  from  balls. This is\nwhere Mark Waugh had the last laugh. Bowling innocuous offbreaks,\nhe saw Tendulkar charge out and bowled wide down the leg side. Ian\nHealy whipped off the bails and the life had gone out of the Indian\nbatting.\nWatching this innings by Tendulkar on TV at home in Adelaide,\nSir Donald Bradman was struck by a sense ofdeja vu. He told his wife\nthat he felt Tendulkar's batting technique was similar to his own.\nThere were more fireworks to follow in India's next match against\nSri Lanka in New Delhi, but the Indians were outplayed on this\noccasion as well. Tendulkar and Azhar were in devastating form,\nplundering  runs from the last ten overs. Tendulkar was run out in\nthe last over for a blazing , his highest  score which took his\naggregate in the World Cup to  runs for three times out. There\nwere five sixes and eight fours and the runs came from  balls.\nIndia's total of for  was seemingly insurmountable. Certainly,\nnothing could have prepared the Indian bowlers and the ,-strong\ncrowd for the onslaught that followed.\nSanathJayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana had proved to be\nhugely effective in the short time they had opened the innings together.\nUnder overcast skies, they reduced the crowd to silence with their first\n coming in an incredible . overs. Only  overs had been bowled\nwhen Sri Lanka lost their fourth wicket at . That would be the last\nsuccess for the Indians as Arjuna Ranatunga and Hashan Tillekeratne\nstrolled to victory. Only Kumble (-) and Tendulkar, who conceded\n from his ten overs, were spared the carnage in a show of might by\nthe Sri Lankans that was a sign of things to come.\nTendulkar's only failure in the entire tournament came against\nZimbabwe in the last league game, when he was bowled by Heath\nStreak for three. But Kambli's  gave the home side victory by \nWorld Cup -and England Again\n\n\n\n\fruns and this set up an electric encounter with Pakistan in the quarterfinals.\nIf any sporting event epitomized George Orwell's description of\nsport as 'war minus the shooting', the India-Pakistan match was it.\nN ormallife came to a standstill in both nations and the tension was\nevident on the field too. It soon became obvious that the team that\nwould hold its nerves best would win the match. Minutes before the\nstart came the dramatic announcement that Pakistan captain Wasim\nAkram had pulled out with an injury and Aamir Sohail would lead\nthe side. It was a lucky break for India. Openers Sidhu and Tendulkar\nmade a cautious start and  was on the board before the latter dragged\none from Ata-ur-Rehman on to his stumps for . By then his partner\nhad reached . It was a sedate innings by Tendulkar's standards,\ntaking  balls, as the openers weathered a hostile opening spell of\nfour overs from Wagar Younis. All the top order batsmen got a good\nstart with Sidhu holding the innings together with . Ajay Jadeja\nprovided the first fireworks of the day when he punished Wagar for \nruns from one over. His  from  balls helped India to a huge \nfor.\nAs in the match against Sri Lanka, the rival openers made merry\nand the total suddenly appeared inadequate. What Jayasuriya and\nKaluwitharana had done to the Indian bowlers at the Kotla, Sohail\nand Saeed Anwar now replicated. The crowd was suddenly silent as\n runs were smashed from the first ten overs. Anwar was the first to\ngo for  from  balls while Sohail continued to attack. The acting\nPakistan captain was known for his abrasive behaviour on the field.\nHe smashed Vcnkatesh Prasad for four, then promptly offered the\nbowler some gratuitous advice. Prasad kept his cool, his next ball was\nfull and straight and bowled So hail for . The Bangalore boys were\ndoing the trick and the crowd was beside itselfwith joy. Prasad picked\nup two more wickets, Ani! Kumble grabbed three, and the Pakistani\nchallenge subsided and died out. Judging by the celebrations on the\nstreets ofBangalorc and indeed throughout the country, one would\nhave thought India had won the World Cup. But there was still the\nhurdle of Sri Lanka to overcome before they could reach the final.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fIf the Ban galore match had brought pride and joy to the country,\nthe Kolkata semi-final brought only shame. Unruly behaviour and\nbottle throwing by the massive crowd at Eden Gardens forced match\nreferee Clive Lloyd to award the game to the Sri Lankans by default,\nthe first and only time this has happened in the history of cricket.\nCoincidentally, the Sri Lankans had started the tournament with two\nwins by forfeit.\nThe crowd's frustration got the better of it as India slid to certain\ndefeat. At  for  in . overs, in reply to Sri Lanka's  for , there\ncould have been only one winner. It was a sad end to a promising\ncampaign by the co-hosts who looked to be peaking after their\nmemorable match against Pakistan. Vinod Kambli on ten walked off\nwith tears streaming down his face and he was not the only one to\nshow his feelings. The Indian dressing room was the picture of\ndejection.\nYet, it could have been so different. Azharuddin went against all\nadvice in opting to field on winning the toss. Then, for a brief while,\nthe Indian bowlers looked to be on top when they got rid of the top\nthree batsmen with just  on the board. But Sri Lanka recovered to\npost a healthy total, with Tendulkar looking the most impressive of\nthe bowlers with  for  from his ten overs. India lost Sidhu early in\nfront of a crowd of ,-the biggest ever for a cricket match.\nOnce again, the onus was on Tendulkar and he found an able partner\nin Manjrekar. He reached his  in the seventeenth over with the\nscore on  for . By the twenty-third over it had gone up to  and the\ntime for acceleration had arrived. Left-arm spinner Jayasuriya replaced\nMuralitharan and slid one down the leg side. The ball brushed\nTendulkar's pad and he moved out of his crease, looking for a leg bye.\nKaluwitharana behind the stumps quickly gathered the ball and\nremoved the bails; the third umpire confirmed the batsman's backward\nlunge had come too late. His  had been another masterly display\nunder immense pressure. The Sri Lankan openers who had blazed a\ntrail throughout the tournament had scored a solitary run between\nthem this time. But they had now combined to pull off the turning\npoint of the match.\nWorld Cup -and England Again\n\n\n\n\fThe Indian batting after that defied all reason. Seven wickets went\ndown for  runs as one a'fter the other, the batsmen committed harakiri. Lloyd's decisiorywas almost an act of mercy, although Indian\ncricket would take a long time to live down the ignominy. The brilliant\nSri Lankans went on to lift the World Cup four days later at Lahore.\nTendulkar finished with the most runs in the tournament: \nruns at . from his seven matches-still the only instance in the\nWorld Cup of a batsman exceeding  runs. Only Ranatunga\n(.) and De Silva (.) had a better average. Ani! Kumble\ncaptured the most wickets (and took the most catches, too). But no\ndoubt, both men would gladly have exchanged these individual\nhonours for the prize that really counted.\nJust a fortnight after the World Cup finals, India, Pakistan and Sri\nLanka were at it again. The hectic schedule of international cricket\nhad brought the three teams together in Singapore, where big-time\ninternational cricket was being played for the first time. The tiny\nPedang ground was tailor-made for big scores and the newly crowl)ed\nworld champions set the ball rolling in the opening match. J ayasuriya\nbroke one world record after another while racing to his century in \nballs against Pakistan, the fastest in oms till then. But Pakistan stormed\nback to beat them in the final. India beat Sri Lanka by  runs to atone\nin some measure for the two World Cup defeats at their hands. But\nthey were beaten by eight wickets by Pakistan and edged out of the\nfinal on net run rate. Tendulkar's round  was his first century\nagainst Pakistan in either form of the game.\nThere was bad news off the field for him, though. For the first time\nhe was fined  per cent of his match fees by the match referee H.\nGardiner of Zimbabwe. His 'fault' was the MRF logo on his bat, which\ninfringed the International Cricket Council's (Icc) ruling prohibiting\nlogos of a particular size other than that of the bat manufacturer.\nFrom Singapore it was over to Sharjah once again for India and\nPakistan, joined for the first time by South Mrica. This time it was\nIndia's turn to pip Pakistan on net run rate and reach the final against\nSouth Mrica, who made it a debut to remember by winning the match\nby  runs. There was, however, the considerable consolation for India\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fof beating Pakistan in the return match by  runs, having lost the\nopening game by  runs. It was the first time in five years that India\nhad turned the tables on Pakistan in their traditional desert stronghold\nand only the third time in the last  years.\nNot surprisingly, it was Tendulkar who led the charge with his\nsecond century in the last three matches against Pakistan. He also\npicked up two wickets, including the last one ofSaqlain Mushtaq's,\nlbw. This led to an uncharacteristically aggressive reaction from the\nbowler, no doubt fuelled by the thrill of beating Pakistan in Sharjah.\nAs a result, Tendulkar received a warning from match referee Ranjan\nMadugalle for the abuse and pointed finger directed at the departing\nbatsman. Madugalle also issued him a friendly warning when the\nissue of the logo on his bat cropped up again and Tendulkar quietly\nremoved it to avoid another fine.\nThe match saw India record its highest total to date ( for )\nwhile the stand for the second wicket () between Tendulkar and\nSidhu was India's best for all wickets. Azhar, by now, appeared\npreoccupied with matters of a more personal nature. Under these\ncircumstances, Tendulkar, the trusted lieutenant; was already being\nperceived as the de facto captain with Azhar often letting him set the\nfield and handle the bowling change. Azhar's batting form was in\ntatters too, and the story goes that Tend ulkar virtually led him by the\nhand to the dressing room door in Sharjah when India recorded their\nrare triumph over their arch-rivals. Azhar's confidence had sunk so\nlow he was trying to push himselflower and lower down the order.\nBut his deputy's faith was repaid when the captain smashed \n(remember, India won by  runs) from ten balls, including  from\nthe last over bowled by Ata-ur-Rehman. The anti-Azhar campaign,\nwhich received its biggest boost after the captain's blunder in the World\nCup semi-final, had by now reached fever pitch. It appeared to be only\na matter of time-and not much at that-before he would be replaced\nin Indian cricket's hot seat by the man who could seemingly do no\nV.Tong.\nTendulkar had made his first Test century at Old Trafford on the \nWorld Cup -and England Again\n\n\n\n\ftour of England. Now India returned for three Tests and three ODis.\nAnd Azhar was still in charge, though barely. The run-up to the first\nTest at Edgbaston could hardly have been worse for the tourists. They\nwere beaten - in the ODis (the first was a no-result after being\ndisrupted by rain). And to make things worse, the experienced Sidhu\nstormed out of the tour and flew back home after a row with the\ncaptain.\nEngland drew first blood in a Test that had seven debutants, four of\nthem from India. Though Nasser Hussain took the Man of the Match\naward for his maiden Test century, it was Tendulkar who stood out\nwith his  out of an Indian second-innings total of. 'The real\nMan of the Match,' as Wisden Cricket Monthly aptly put it.\nThe rest of the Indian batting in both innings ended up in shambles,\nwith number nine Srinath being the only other to pass . Trailing by\n after the first innings, it would have been a total rout but for the\nIndian vice captain's ninth Test . With wickets falling in a heap\naround him, Tendulkar went for the bowling on a track that offered\nplenty ofhelp to the seamers. It took him  balls to get to his , with\n of the runs coming from boundaries. Manjrekar and Kumble gave\nhim a modicum of support and enabled him to reach three figures,\nwhich came with a straight six offMumbai-born spinner Min Patel.\nIt was a flawless innings with strokes all around the wicket. The bowlers\nwere treated with disdain as he hit  fours plus one six. With batsmen\non both sides struggling to cope with the uneven bounce and\nmovement off the pitch, this was a batting display that finally cemented\nhis place as the best in the world.\nTendulkar was ninth out when he skied a bouncer from outside off\nstump from Chris Lewis to Graham Thorpe, who caught it running\nbackwards at midwicket. Geoffrey Boycott summed up the way he\nrose head and shoulders above the rest of the Indian batting: 'The best\nway for India to beat England would be to have Sachin Tendulkar bat\nat number one, two, three, four and five.'\nThe Sportstar spoke to Tendulkar ( June ) and asked him to\nrank his nine Test tons. He put the Edgbaston innings at number two,\nafter his  at Perth in . At number three was the  against\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fSouth Mrica at Johannesburg in the same year. At fourth spot was his\nmaiden century,  not out, against England at  ld Trafford in .\nHis century at Sydney in  was placed number five, followed by\n v West Indies (Mumbai, );  v England (Chennai, );\n v Sri Lanka (Lucknow, ) and finally,  not out, also against\nSri Lanka (Colomho sse, ).\nThe second Test at Lord's was drawn and was notable for the Test\ndebuts ofSourav Ganguly () and Rahul Dravid (). Tendulkar\nwas bowled by a beauty from Lewis for . The third and final Test\nwas another high-scoring draw at Trent Bridge as England repeated\nthe  series scoreline of-. Both teams scored -plus in the first\ninnings and there were four century makers. Ganguly followed up\nhis debut ton with  while Tendulkar came the closest he has ever\nbeen in his career to making two centuries in the same Test. The firstinnings  was his fourth against England and tenth overall, a\nremarkable feat for a -year-old. In the second, he skied an intended\npull offLewis and was out for . The combined match aggregate of\n remains his highest and made him the top scorer by far on either\nside in the series. Dropped at slip on zero and then surviving a confident\nlbw appeal off Dominic Cork, Tendulkar appeared to have been\ncoasting to his maiden double century. But as in the second innings, it\nwas a careless lofted shot which saw his dismissal.\nHe also led India on the field for nearly the entire duration of the\nEngland innings. Azhar was hit on the ankle by Stewart while fielding\non the third day and only returned to bat on the fifth and final day.\nEngland amassed , a lead of , and there was already some criticism\nofTendulkar's captaincy. This is how he defended himself in an article\nin the Times if India nearly a year later (June ):\nBy the end of the Indian cricket team's England tour of ,\nmy name was being mentioned for captaincy for the\nforthcoming season. Hence on the third day of the third Test\nmatch against England when captain Azharuddin reported unfit\nand I took charge of the team, my captaincy received special\nWorld Cup -and England Again\n\n\n\n\fattention.\nMter India had scored  runs in the llrst innings it was\nexpected of me to put pressure on England by placing an\nattacking field and making proper bowling changes. Contrary\nto this, it appeared I was adopting tactics which had slowed\ndown the pace of the game. Obviously, my moves were not\nappreciated by cricket lovers. The fact was that things were not\nso easy. Centuries scored by Atherton and Hussain reduced\nchances of our possible lead in the first innings considerably. At\nthis stage I thought it would be unwise if we got England out\nquickly. This would have made India bat in their second innings\nrather too early, which could have created problems for us.\nRathore was unfit to bat; Manjrekar and Mongia were to open\nthe innings and were not in go_od form; Ganguly and Dravid\nwere playing only their second Test; Azharuddin was injured\nand was not in good form. He was to bat only if needed. I thought\none or two quick wickets could have changed the complexion\nof the game and the situation could have been reversed. These\ntwo days of experience made me realise the ordeal of captaincy\nthat I would have to face ifl was selected captain of the team.\nThere was no doubt, however, that Tendulkar was streets ahead of\nall the other batsmen in the series, so it didn't come as a surprise when\nhe was chosen as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by Wtsden\nCricketers' Alrnanack ().\n\n\n\nSachin Captaincy-I\n\nIt's onlyfor my team's sake that I cannot sleep.-Sachin Tendulkar\nIt was a virtual fait accompli following the England tour that Sachin\nTendulkar would be asked to take over the captaincy from Mohammad\nAzharuddin. Azhar's unbroken spell of seven years was one of the\nlongest for an Indian captain. The youngest in the history of Test\ncricket to take on the responsibility was 'Tiger' Pataudi. He was just\n when the captain's job was thrust on him after a near fatal injury\nsuffered by captain Nari Contractor on the  tour of the West\nIndies. Appointed vice captain for the series, Pataudi was groomed for\nthe top post, as was Tendulkar. But while Tendulkar had three years as\nthe number two, Pataudi did not enjoy the luxury of even one full\nseries.\n'Time for Change' was the headline in the Sportstar ( July ),\nand in it R. Mohan summed up the mood oflndian cricket followers:\n'The way forward for Indian cricket is to appoint Sachin Tendulkar\ncaptain now. His cricketing powers and his cricket faculties are in\nacute focus and there is no better time to hand over charge to a young\nman. A young man in charge ofa young team is the only route forward.'\nSure enough, on  August , when the squad for the Singer Cup\none-day tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Sahara Cup 'Friendship' oneday series against Pakistan in Toronto was announced, Sachin was\nnamed captain.\nIn his debut series in Pakistan in , Sachin's captain K.Srikkanth\nhad told him, perhaps only half-jokingly, 'When you are captain,\nremember who was your first.' Now, the appointment received a\n\n\funanimous welcome. The question on everybody's mind was, could\nTendulkar, the batsman with the golden touch, transfer those skills\neffortlessly to the captaincy as well? This is what Sunil Gavaskar\nwrote in his column in the Sportstar (September ): 'My gut feeling\nis that the responsibility [of the captaincy] will see greater consistency\nfrom him and less throwing of the wicket to casual, experimental\nshots. It might make him a marginally less attractive player, but if he\ntightens up he will play longer. And which one of us would complain\nto seeing more of his batting?' There was also concern over how Azhar\nwould fit into the scheme of things now that he was no longer in\ncharge.\nThese doubts were dispelled-at least for the time being-upon\nTendulkar's debut as captain against Sri Lanka at the R.Premadasa\nStadium in Colombo, on  August. Though India were routed by\nnine wickets, Tendulkar marked the day with his ninth  ton and\nadded  runs for the third wicket with Azhar. It was the world\nchampions' first home game, five months after winning the title, and\nonce again it was the explosive opening pair of Jayasuriya and\nKaluwitharana that knocked the stuffing out of the Indian bowling.\nThe Indians made short work ofZimbabwe in their next match before\nbeing edged out by Australia in the last league game to decide who\nwould meet Sri Lanka in the final (the result was a repeat of the World\nCup final).\nIn his book Indian Cricket: The Captains-From Nayudu to Tendulkar,\nPartab Ramchand wrote about Tendulkar's first stint in charge:\nReally there can be nothing but praise for the manner in which\nTendulkar conducted himself in his various capacities as\ncaptain. He made every attempt to get to know and understand\nhis players, their needs, their requirements, their comforts. He\nmade every attempt to goad his players on the field and, by now,\nleading by personal example was second nature to him. He\nmade every attempt to be accessible to the media and in the\npublic relations aspect he was a big improvement over his\npredecessor. India's failure to gain, very narrowly, a berth in the\nISO\n\nSachin\n\n\ffinal, did not in any way make a dent in his popularity.\nFrom Sri Lanka it was straight to Toronto, where big-time cricket\nwould be played in Canada for the first time in the inaugural India v\nPakistan five-match one-day series. India could have wrapped things\nup after leading -. But Pakistan, under the experienced Wasim\nAkram, stormed back to win the fourth and fifth games and the series.\nThough his captaincy was praised as positive, Tendulkar's batting fell\naway after he won the Man of the Match award for an unbeaten  in\nthe first match, which India won by eight wickets. Thereafter, he had\nscores of, ,  and  on sub-standard batting pitches which were\nseverely affected by incessant rain.\nThere was some controversy during the series, about the preference\nof Vi nod Kambli over Sourav Ganguly for the third and fourth\nmatches. Kambli had scores of,  and . Neither Sourav nor he got\na chance to bat in the first match. Ganguly was  not out in the\nsecond and when he replaced Kambli in the fifth and final game, he\ncould manage just . The criticism (not surprisingly, mainly from\nWest Bengal) obviously stung. Tendulkar reacted angrily. He had no\nintention of grabbing the captaincy, he said. If the selectors had\nconfidence in him, they should let him do things his way, without\ninterfering. He defended his choice ofKambli by saying that he was\nthe best batsman for that wicket, and if Ganguly wasn't upset, why\nshould other people?\nAsked in Toronto to give his views on his counterpart's captaincy,\nWasimAkram was measured in his response: 'Yeah, he has the makings\nof a very aggressive captain. Give him at least six more months before\nyou start judging him. He is attacking and energetic but the Test\nmatches in the season ahead will be his greatest challenge.' (Sportsworld,\nOctober )\nThere would be a one-offTest for the inaugural Border-Gavaskar\nTrophy in New Delhi in October, followed by a three-Test home\nseries against South Mrica. In between, India lifted the Titan Cup\none-day title in the tri-series involving Australia and South Mrica.\nThe Australians were weakened by the absence of the injured Shane\nCaptaincy- I\n\n\n\n\fWarne who no doubt would have licked his lips in anticipation had he\ntaken one look at the Feroze Shah Kotla pitch.\nIt was a new Indian team management that was in charge. Madan\nLal had replaced Sandeep Patil as coach while the visitors too had a\nnew coach, with GeoffMarsl: taking over from Bobby Simpson. The\nAustralians were ill-equipped to exploit a wicket that turned from the\nfirst session and they were outclassed in three and a half days. Tendulkar\nfailed with the bat ( and ) in his first Test as captain. But everything\nelse went his way as India won by seven wickets, their first victory\nover Australia since  in Melbourne. The state of the pitchwhich was to find its way into the CBI report into match-fixing four\nyears later-was defended by the new Indian captain. 'There is no\nharm in playing to your strength. We need not worry about what kind\nof pitches we might get in South Africa and West Indies.'\nUnderstandably perhaps, Mark Taylor's views were not quite so\npositive.\nAustralia's poor form continued in the Titan Cup as they lost all\ntheir league matches. South Mrica, on the other hand, appeared\nunstoppable as they flattened India and Australia in the run-up to the\nfinal. Tendulkar was in sparkling form and had three half-centuries in\nthe league phase. The final was expected to be one-sided-and it was.\nSurprisingly, it was the Indians who came out on top. The captain\nmay have had an inkling the day before when he told the media: 'The\nSouth Mrican batting can collapse.'\nThis it did, folding up for  in reply to India's  for , with the\nonly  of the low-scoring game inevitably coming from Tendulkar.\nTendulkar's proactive approach while defending the small total must\nhave come as a pleasant surprise to most of the team, as they were used\nto Azhar's low-key approach to captaincy. It started with Sachin giving\na short pep talk to his team as they went out to field under the lights.\nAnd it continued till last man Allan Donald was bowled. Tendulkar\nwas more than just active, he was a touch hyperactive, whether in\nadvising bowlers, handling the field placements with elaborate care,\nor even taking advice at on-field meetings. This gave the impression\nofhis being hands-on and in charge, and impressed the critics no end.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fBut a year later, when the defeats outstripped the wins, the same style\n\nof captaincy was condemned as naive and over the tp.\nSachin's first full series in charge against the strong SouthMricans\nwas a topsy-turvy affair. India won the first Test at Ahmedabad, were\ncrushed by  runs in the second at Kolkata, and then stormed back\nto win the decider at Kanpur by  runs. It turned out to be the worst\nseries ofTendulkar's career with the bat to date (the one against New\nZealand the year before, at home, had been severely curtailed by rain),\nand fortunately for India, it still remains his worst. He had scores of\n, , , ,  and  to go with his twin failures in the one-offTest\nagainst Australia. His two kno'cks at Kanpur showed a new Sachin to\nthe Indian public. It was a Sachin who eschewed stroke play for\noccupation of the crease, in an echo ofhis mentor Gavaskar's prediction\nin his column. In the first innings, he batted for three and a half hours\nto hold the shaky innings together and top-scored in a total of. In\nthe second he played the uncharacteristic supporting role, occupying\nthe crease for  minutes as Azharuddin reeled off his second\nsuccessive century following his dazzling  at Kolkata.\nWrote R.Mohan in the Cricketer International (February ), at\nthe end of the series, 'The change at the helm effected during the year\nproved far reaching while also bringing in a twin benefit. Sachin\nTendulkar's captaincy, dynamic in most parts, and Mohammad\nAzharuddin's batting touch, a splendid recreation of all that is good\nabout Indian batsmanship, came about because the switch at the top\nwas made well in time.' Added Mohan, 'The most positive aspect to\nemerge from the series is that a young captain is prepared to play\npositive cricket. He has learned his lessons quickly. He may have hit a\nlow in the negative cricket he made his team play in the second Test in\nCalcutta but he came out of that mindset, in time to go for the series\nwin in Kanpur.'\nIt was the first time South Mrica had been beaten in a full series\nsince their return to Test cricket in . For India, the unbeaten run\nat home now stretched to almost a decade. But the real test would\ncome when the Indians moved to South Mrica for the second leg of\nthe contest.\nCaptaincy- I\n\n\n\n\fThere was just enough time at the end of the tour to squeeze in one\nmore match. The Mohinder Amarnath benefit game at Mumbai was\ngiven official status at the eleventh hour, much to the fury ofCronje\nand his men who were keen to get back home after a strenuous tour.\nTendulkar led the a:,sault with his tenth  century and South Mrica\nwere routed.\nFour years later, the real story behind this match would emerge.\n\n\n\nSachin\n Defeat and Despair\n\nIt was a privilege to be there.-Dave Richardson\nThat old tag, 'Tigers at home, kittens abroad,' which has attached itself\nto the Indian team over the s must have been at the back of\nSachin Tendulkar's mind as he prepared himself for his first tour as\ncaptain. The one-offTest against Australia and the three Tests v South\nMrica at home had given him the time and breathing space to get used\nto the rigours of his new role. Nothing, though, could have prepared\nhim for the shocking capitulation in the opening Test at Kingsmead,\nDurban.\nThe South Africans had been aggrieved by the pitch they\nencountered at Ahmedabad. Now, within a fortnight, it was time for\nrevenge. And a brutal reality check for Sachin.\nThe match was over shortly after tea on the third day. India\ncrumbled to  and ---the lowest ever score against South Mrica\nin Test cricket. Both innings together lasted a total of. overs-less\nthan a full day's play-with Allan Donald taking  for  in the match.\nSouth Mrica too struggled on a brute of a pitch, scoring  and .\nBut even their first innings would have been sufficient. In the end,\nthey won by  runs and the Indian team was in disarray at the start\nof the series. Even Man of the Match Andrew Hudson ( and )\nwas forced to admit: 'You were never really in on that wicket.'\nAs has often happened in Tendulkar's career, the rival bowlers and\nfielders reserved their best for when he was at the crease. In the first\ninnings he was bowled by a beauty from Donald for . In the second,\n\n\fit was an astonishing catch by Gary Kirsten at gully offShaun Pollock\nthat sent him back for four. Donald felt the ball that got Sachin got was\none of the most lethal he had ever bowled in a Test match. Following\ntwo half-volleys which were driven regally to the boundary, Tendulkar\ngot one that pitched on a perfect length just cutside off stump. It\njagged back at such speed that the batsman was still in the process of\nbringing down his bat when the stump was sent cartwheeling in the\ndirection of the stunned wicketkeeper. 'I always get fired up a bit extra\nwhen I bowl at Sachin and the Waughs,' said the delighted bowler in\na rich tribute to his victim.\nIn the second innings, a sliced drive at Pollock was flying at great\nspeed and some distance from gully. An airborne Kirsten clutched it\non the dive.\nIndia were crushed again in the second Test at Cape Town, this\ntime by  runs as the home side scaled the series -. But this time,\ntwo Indian batsmen produced a partnership fit for the gods, of which\nplayers on both sides still speak in awe.\nThe batsmen were Tcndulkar and Azhar, the stand was worth ,\nthe runs came in  uvers and produced  minutes of some of the\nmost exhilarating batting seen in the history ofTest cricket. Yet, India\nwere soundly beaten once again as they capitulated for  in the\nsecond innings. South Mrica had piled up a massive  for  declared\nwith Kirsten, Brian McMillan and Lance Kluscner all striking\ncenturies. But even these paled in the face of the onslaught launched\nby the current captain and his immediate predecessor. They came\ntogether with India reeling at a hopeless  for . Once they \u00b7JVere\nparted the innings folded up for  with only two others reaching\ndouble figures.\nInstead of grinding it out, two of the most gifted stroke players in\nthe modern game decided to fight fire with fire. Azhar played with a\ncare and abandon not seen since his magnificent series in England in\n. His hatting was exotic and unorthodox, and more than a little\nrisky. Tendulkar's was more along classic lines, though no less\nattractive. Both had their chances. With the stand worth  Azhar\nwas dropped by Cronje at extra cover; a run later, it was Tendulkar on\n\n\nSac hi n\n\n\f who was reprieved by Hudson at gully. Hudson had also missed\nAzhar on . But the crowd did not seem to mind one bit. They cheered\nevery stroke as if they were being executed by their own batsmen.\nSuch was the spell cast by the two Indians. Klusener was hammered\nout of the attack, smashed for four boundaries in his first over after\nlunch and for  runs from six overs. The follow-on mark was still \nruns away when Azhar was run out by a Hudson throw from backward\npoint. He had batted for just under three hours and raced to  off\n balls with  fours and a six. Tendulkar looked determined to\nreach his first double century. Instead, he was out to a catch of such\ndazzling quality by Adam Bacher deep on the square leg fenceleaping backwards and plucking the ball with one hand as it sped to\nthe boundary-that Tendulkar could only stand shaking his head,\nhand on hip. He was the last man out for  ( boundaries) off\nMcMillan after a stay of  minutes. It was perhaps fitting that it\ntook such a magical catch to end such a magical innings.\nIt was not only the South African spectators who were dazzled.\nThe man with the best view was South African wicketkceper Dave\nRichardson and this is what he told me about Tendulkar's innings: 'I\ncan say it was the only occasion when I have honestly enjoyed an\nopposing player scoring a century. It was a privilege to be there. It\nobviously helped that despite the century SA was still in a strong position\nin the game.'\nRichardson was not the only South African player to feel that way.\nAllan Donald described the innings as 'fabulous', and admitted that\nfor once he had detatched himself from his role of fast bowler to\nappreciate the stroke play of his opponent.\nEnglishman John Woodcock has reported on more Test cricket\nthan any other journalist alive. Even he could not think of any\npartnership to match this one. Another English journalist, Matthew\nEngel (then the editor ofWisden Cricketers' Almanack) wrote in Wisden\nCricket Monthly (February ):\nFor a few hours in Cape Town on the first Saturday of  the\ngame of cricket got as near as it perhaps can ever get to being\nDefeat and Despair\n\n\n\n\fsublime ... .Tendulk:ar's innings was what one expects from him:\nmature, controlled, commanding-the weight of his country's\nexpectations resting lightly on his shoulders. The extra\ndimension came from the other end. Azharuddin played what\nyou might call an ex-captain's innings .... He was determined\nto go out there and indulge in the carefree pleasure of showing\neveryone how to hit a cricket ball.\nThe visitors had their best chance to pull one back in the third and\nfinal Test at Johannesburg but were thwarted by weather and a defiant\nunbeaten  by Daryl! Cullinan. South Mrica, who set a target of\n in  overs were at  for  when play was called off under dark\nskies with four overs remaining. Earlier,  minutes were lost to rain\nand this robbed the Indians of a well-deserved victory. Tendulk:ar was\nclearly disappointed at being denied, but felt the draw had boosted the\nconfidence of his young side on the eve of the one-day tri-series.\nThe oms produced some splendid contests with South Mrica\nstorming into the final with an all-win record and India edging past\nZimbabwe. The outsiders held India to a tie in their first match and\nthen beat them in the penultimate game to push the league phase\ndown to the wire. India not only had to beat Zimbabwe in Benoni, but\nalso had to do it fast enough to push their net run rate above that of\ntheir opponents. It was touch -and-go and once again, it was the captain\nwho showed the way.\nZimbabwe reached  for  in their  overs and the Indian target\nwas -from . overs. That they got home by six wickets in .\nwas largely due to Tendulkar's rip-roaring , ably supported by\nAjay Jac;leja ( not out). Dravid had opened with Ganguly in the\nprevious matches, but now Tendulkar was back at the top of the order\nto give the run chase the launching pad it needed. The final had to be\nreplayed after the first one was washed out with SouthMrica well on\ntop. It was different altogether in the replay, and India came pretty\nclose to pulling off a sensational victory thanks to the batting of\nTendulkar and Dravid.\nSouth Mrica piled up  for  in  overs. Rain intervened again\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fand India's target was altered to a stiffer  from  overs. Tendulkar\nset the tone with a lightning  from  balls and his stand of  with\nDravid came at eight an over. Dravid carried the fight almost to the\nend with a superb  which won him the Man of the Match award.\nBut India fell  runs short with South Mrican lernpers rising and\ntheir behaviour on the field getting worse as the match seemed to slip\nout of their grasp.\nThe tourists had shown considerable spirit in coming back strongly,\nboth in the Test and ODI tri-series, after the early setbacks. However,\nthe lack of success weighed heavily on the captain's mind.\nR.Mohan revealed Tendulkar's fatalistic state of mind midway\nthrough the tour in the Sportstar ( March ): 'Sachin was speaking\nto a friend in his room that evening, asking him ifhe should consider\nstepping doyvn from the captaincy. The very thought, fleeting though\nit may have been, was reflective of the emotional state of mind he was\nin then.'\nMohan admitted that the captain's frame of mind improved after\nthe latter stages of the tri-series. But the experienced journalist got it\nwrong when he repeatedly stated in the article that Tendulkar's\ncaptaincy would be safe for many years to come. There were already\nrumblings that the captain was unhappy with the team that he had\nbeen presented with for the five Tests and four oms for India's first\nvisit to the Caribbean since losing - in .\nDespite the face that the West Indies were a shadow of what they\nhad been eight years earlier, virtual back-to-hack tours to South Mrica\nand the West Indies was a challenge for both the team and the captain.\nIn the interview that accompanied Mohan's article in the same issue,\nTendulkar expressed concern at the enormous workload imposed on\nthe Indian players. Indeed,  would probably be the most hectic\never, with tours to South Mrica, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Pakistan,\nToronto and Sharjah for Test and  tournaments, as well as home\ngames. There was also an uncanny quote from Tendulkar. 'If any of\nthem [Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad] breaks down in the West Indies! hope it doesn't happen-it's going to be very tough.'\nSure enough, within two days of the team landing in Kingston,\nDefeat and Despair\n\n\n\n\fJamaica, the main strike bowler Srinath had to quit the tour because\nof a rotator cuff tear in his shoulder that had been troubling him for\nsome time. It was a crippling blow to the team's hopes. Apart frorn\nVenkatesh Prasad, debutant Abey Kuruvilla, the raw D.Ganesh, and\nall-rounder Robin Singh were the only medium-pace bowlers left in\nthe squad. To make things worse, there followed a quixotic move by\nthe selectors which foxed one and all. Srinath's replacement was\nHyderabacl's Noel David, an off-spinning all-rounder, even though\nmedium-pacer Salil An kola was on standby, and was the first choice of\nthe team management. David was not even a front line spinner for\nHyderabad.\nIronically, Tendulkar had been keen on an off-spinner at the\nselection meeting forth<? West Indies tour, as Prem Panicker of Rediffcom\ntestified.\nI was at the CCI that day, when the selectors were picking the\nside to tour the We.st Indies. I do remember Sachin storming\nout of the meeting before it was less than half over-I happened\nto be standing in the carpark enjoying a quiet smoke when he\ncame stomping out and I asked him what happened ... and he\nuncharacteristically burst out with 'If they don't want to listen\nto my opinions, why do they bother asking me to attend these\nmeetings?' and he got into his car and slammed out of there.\nFor me that was the first sign that something was going wrong\nbetween Sachin and the selectors.\nHe never did say 'Noel who?' when Noel David was named\nto replace Srinath-that is apocryphal, a media creation. But\nhe did get rather bitter and in a team meeting, said something\nto the effect that the selectors had deliberately named a bowler\nwho has never bowled off spin.\nI know one thing for sure-he was very, very upset then, he\nbelieved the team had a superb chance to beat the Windies with\nspin and wanted to, and he thought selectorial politics was what\nkept him from pulling it off.\n\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fPoor David would sit out the whole Test series and get his chance\nonly in the oms that followed.\nIndia, with their limited bowling attack, did well to draw the first\nTest at Kingston. Though West Indies were on the decline, they were\nno pushovers, with Ambrose and Walsh still firing away and the batting\nin the safe hands of Lara and Chanderpaul. Half the final day was\nwashed out and India, set  to win, finished on  for two after an\novewight declaration by Walsh. Tendulkar pointed out that this was\nthe first time an Indian touring side had escaped defeat in the opening\nTest of a series abroad since he made his debut in Pakistan in . It\nhad, in fact, happened once before, in the Kandy Test in . But that\nwas severely curtailed by rain with just  minutes' play possible in\nall.\nIf this series was to be a match up between Lara and Tendulkar, the\nWest Indian had certainly won the first round. He was at his best in\nthe first innings when he cracked a delightful  and followed it up\nwith . Tendulkar had scores of and  not out.\nTraditionally, Port-of-Spain has been the venue where touring\nIndian sides have had their best results, thanks_to a pitch which is spin\nfriendly. Only twice before had India won Test matches in the\nCaribbean and both were played in the Trinidad capital.\nJust as the home side had the better of the draw in the first Test,\nIndia, it could be said, won t!e second on point. But then, this was\ncricket, not boxing, and it appeared from the very first ball that the\ntourists would be more than satisfied with another draw.\nPlaying in his fiftieth Test match, Tendulkar ground out one of his\nslowest batting displays after the West Indians had been dismissed for\n in their first innings. The Indian batting received a jolt when\nLaxman was out to Ambrose from the second ball of the innings.\nThereafter, it was safety-first tactics with Navjot Singh Sidhu-back\nfor the series after serving his sentence following the episode in\nEngland-recording the second slowest double century in Test cricket.\nDravid and Sidhu did the initial rescue act in their second wicket\nstand of. This was consolidated by the captain when he joined the\nopener to pile up a further . But at no time did the batsmen seek to\nDefeat and Despair\n\n\n\n\faccelerate the scoring. And Ganguly was one of the main culprits.\nTendulkar had occupied the crease for  minutes when Walsh\nran him out for . He struggled to find his touch and had several\nclose lbw appeals go in his favour as he padded up. The closest was\nfrom the second ball he faced. Ambrose was the bowler and the only\nperson on the ground who did not think it was out was Australian\numpire Steve Randell. The lead was a substantial for the Indians.\nBut too much time had been consumed and a draw was inevitable\nfrom then onwards, which seemed to please the Indians.\nBut their world came crashing around them in the next Test at\nBridgetown, Barbados with a shocking fourth innings collapse. This\nsealed not only the Test, but effectively the series as well for the West\nIndies. The pitch was sub-standard, the ball seamed all over the place\nand the uneven bounce caused all sorts of problems for the batsmen.\nBut after the dreary draws in the first and second Tests, it did at least\nproduce a result.\nLara led the West Indies for the first time, since Walsh was declared\nunfit. Tendulkar won the toss and opted to field and the seam attack of\nPrasad, Ganesh and Kuruvilla rewarded their captain by getting the\nWest Indies out for . The innings was held together by Shivnarine\nChanderpaul whose  not out was his first century following \ns. For the second time in a row, the Indians gained the first innings\nlead, even if it was only  runs. Tendulkar played a cla~sy innings,\nand was eight short ofhis first century in the West Indies, when umpire\nLloyd Barker failed to call Ian Bishop for over-stepping. The resulting\n'catch' was a brilliant one by Sherwin Campbell at deep gully.\nMter his tentative batting in the early part of the tour, this was\nclassic Tendulkar all over again as he and Dravid established a record\nfor the third wicket for India in the West Indies, of  runs. At least\nhalf ofTendulkar's  tours from  balls came from cuts, and his six\nwas a pull offRose. His batting was superb as he dispatched anything\nloose with outstanding shot selection. Twice he hit balls that werejust\nshort of a length off the back foot through extra cover-one of the\nmost difficult shots in the book.\nThe Indian seamers were back in action in the second innings to\n\n\nSachin\n\n\frout West Indies for , their lowest score against India at home. Lara\ncounter-attacked to top score with  and then a last wicket stand\nworth  between Ambrose and Dillon pushed the target for India to\n. Their runs made all the difference in the end and Tendulkar was\ncriticized for his defensive field placements during the stand.\nThere was tremendous tension all round at the Kensington Oval\non the fourth (and final) day as India sought to earn only their third\nvictory in nearly  years in the Caribbean. It was not to be. The\ntourists were all out for , even if their captain said at the end that it\nwas  per cent due to the pitch and  per cent due to their poor\nbatting. In a mere three hours, the Indian batsmen had thrown away\nall the good work of the previous three days. 'I still can't believe we\ncouldn't make  runs,' said the shattered skipper after a defeat that\nhe still looks back on as one of the most disappointing mom~nts in his\ncareer. 'It you can't score  to win you deserve to be punished,' was\nthe harsh verdict from Madan La!, the disgusted coach.\nLara manipulated his bowlers in a masterly manner with only\nAmbrose, Bishop and Rose (debutant Merv Dillon did not get to bowl)\nbeing entrusted with the task of bowling out the Indians. The score of\n was their lowest in the West Indies. Overnight two without loss,\nSidhu was the first to go on the fourth morning. Once again, umpire\nBarker erred in not calling a no-ball. The opener desperately tried to\nfend off one from Rose which was climbing towards his throat.\nWatching from the dressing room, panic set in among the batsmen as\nthey allowed the unpredictable pitch to prey on their minds.\nIfSidhu was forced to fend for his life, Azharuddin was shocked by\none from Ambrose that crashed into his stumps at shin level. Tendulkar\nwas done in by the bowler, rather than the pitch. A perfectly pitched\nlate out swinger from Bishop saw him caught low down to his left by\nLara at the lone slip. Only Laxrnan () reached double figures as the\nBajan crowd celebrated late into the night. Vijay Lokapally summed\nup India's dismal performance in the Spottstar (April): 'There\nwas no attempt to push oneselfbeyond the expected levels. There was\nnot a single partnership worth mention in the second innings and the\ndisgraceful display left a sour note on a tour which had been quite\nDefeat and Despair\n\n\n\n\fencouraging till then.'\nBack in the solitude ofhis hotel room after the defeat, a journalist\nwas shocked to see Sachin break down and weep. It had been a\nshattering blow. Wtsden Cricket Monthly (May ) compared the\nperformances of the two 'superstar captains'. It gave Lara nine out of\nten and his Indian counterpart seven out of ten-a fair assessment.\nMter all the excitement ofBarbados, the series petered out with the\nlast two Tests at St. John's, Antigua and Georgetown, Guyana\nproducing rain-dominated draws. Tendulkar finished second in the\naverages behind Dravid with  runs at .. Three times he came\nclose to a century. A five-Test series without a single century was\ncertainly unusual for the master.\nLooking back on the series in an interview with Lokapally in the\nSportstar ( May ), he would rue the loss at Barbados. 'I think it\nwas a combination of good bowling by the West Indies, bad batting by\nus nd a terrible track,' he said when asked 'What really went wrong at\nBarbados?'\n'It was very tough batting in the fourth innings. It was mainly the\nbatting which let us down. I can only hope that such mistakes are not\nrepeated.'\nInevitably, the question ofwhether the captaincy had inhibited his\n'strokemaking instincts' cropped up.\nThere were situations when we would have lost early wickets\nand naturally I was required to hang in there ... .I like the ball to\ncome onto the bat. Since I became captain, it is only in South\nMrica that I have played on wickets where the ball was coming\non and once in Barbados .... On slow tracks, where you have\ntwo players in catching position and a deep point, I have to\ncurb myself. I just can't go and slam the ball because runs in\ninternational cricket are not easy to come by. I would rather\nwait than try to prove I am not bothered by pressure and play\nmy natural game. I would prefer getting slow s or s than a\nquick  or .\n\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fThe matter of team selection was also raised and here Tendulkar's\nwords were to haunt him soon, considering the storm just ahead.\n\nQ: How much say do you have in selection matters, or planning\nan itinerary?\nA: Nothing at all. Not even in the selection matters. I only\nmake suggestions and the decisions are taken by the selectors.\nThe captain and the manager have no vote at all.\nQ: Would you like to have one?\nA: Most definitely because I have to play with the side and not\nothers. I am the one who is to handle the side and I must have\nthe players I want.\nSadly, the tour which had started on a promising note would end\non a bitter one. The four ODis that followed the Test series had more\nthan their fair share of controversy. Ganguly had crawled to  from \nballs in the second Test at Port-of-Spain when quick runs were needed.\nThis was apparently held against him by the tour management and\nhe found himself dropped for the fifth Test and the first ODI at Port-ofSpain. Predictably, this led to a storm back home in Kolkata which\nhad also reacted in fury when their favourite son had been dropped a\nfew months earlier in Toronto.\nWest Indies easily won the opening game by eight wickets but\nwere stunned in the second at the same venue.\nTendulkar admitted he had misread the pitch on winning the toss\nin the first match. But he sought to make amends with the bat and\n::.mashed nine fours in his  ( balls), audaciously stepping out to\nthe fast bowlers, knowing full well how difficult the pitch was. It took\nan atrocious decision by umpire Eddie Nicholls to halt him in full\nflow, adjudged caught behind when the ball had grazed his right\nshoulder. After the match he showed the red mark where the ball had\nhit him.\nGanguly was back for the second match. A brilliant bowling display\nby Prasad. Kuruvilla and debutant David skittled out the West Indies\nfor , their lowest against India in an . With rain interruptions.\nDefeat and Despair\n\n\n\n\fthe target was revised to  from  overs and the runs were promptly\nrattled off by openers Tendulkar ( not out) and Ganguly from just\n. overs even as more rain threatened.\nAll the good work was undone by two awful batting displays as the\nWest Indies ran away - winners. 'Incredible,' was all a stunned\nTendulkar could utter at the end of a shocking collapse in the third\ngame at Amos Vale, St. Vincent.\nChasing  for victory, the Indians were coasting with Ganguly\nand Dravid at the crease. Their stand was worth  from  overs and\nthe score was  when the second wicket fell. It came down to  off\n balls with eight wickets in hand. Unbelievably, those wickets fell in\na heap for India to be all out for . Mter the good start, the batsmen\nsimply lashed out at the bowling when the target was well within\nreach. Azharuddin was out to a terrible shot when well set on , and\nthe rest followed suit.\nThere had been ugly scenes in the Indian dressing room before\nthe match when Sidhu declared himself unfit due to a knee injury\nsuffered during the warm-up. Even as he prepared to go out to the\ntoss, those on the scene reported that Tendulkar was forced to separate\na furious Madan Lal and Sidhu, with the coach accusing the batsman\nof'not wanting to play for the country'. Hardly the sort of thing to put\nthe team in the right frame of mind. And things went from bad to\nworse after that.\n'I gave the batsmen instructions,' said the captain who was so\nfurious that no team member dared to approach him at the dinner\ntable in the hotel in the evening. 'Don't hit in the air,' he sent repeated\ninstructions. But they continued to play airy shots. 'I thought it was\nlack of cricketing sense. As a captain I can only tell them and expect\nthem to follow my instructions. I can't go play for them in the middle.'\nMadan La I too was left fuming at the way the potential lead had been\nthrown away so callously.\nWest Indies returned the compliment from the second match by\ncrushing India by ten wickets in the final game, at the venue of their\nsensational Test triumph five weeks earlier. By then the fight had\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fgone out of the Indian camp and the overwhelming emotion at the\nend of another disappointing tour was one of relief that it was all over.\n\nDefeat and Despair\n\n\n \nConfrontation\n\nThe Indian skipper is powerless.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nThe most high-profile victim of the West Indies debacle was\nMohammad Azharuddin. It was not only his miserable form on the\ntour, but the way he threw away his wicket on more than one occasion\nthat forced the selectors to take the decision prior to the Independence\nCup four-nation tournament staged in India in the summer of .\n'Let it be said that Sachin Tendulkar had it up to here,' wrote R. Mohan,\na staunch Azhar supporter, in the cover story of the Sponstar ( May\n), headlined: 'He Had It Coming.'\nHe could not wait anymore for results from Azhar's bat and\ngreater support to the younger men of the middle order. Any\nresidual sympathy may have been washed away in St. Vincent\nwhere Azhar simply did not take charge of the business end of\nthe chase as he should have.\nHere was a great opportunity for him to pay back his skipper\nfor all the support and the understanding on two tours that\nhave been the toughest in many years. One good knock from\nhim in the second and third Tests and one in St. Vincent would\nhave given India at least a half share of the one-day series. One\nknock, just one knock from the country's most experienced\ncricketer would have enabled the side to make history.\nWhat did it get in return but careless strokes played as if\nwinning matches was not his concern? The flailing shot that\n\n\fballooned to cover in St. Vincent was the last straw.\nThe writer dismissed the talk of bookie influence behind that\n'flailing shot' as 'so many straws in the wind'. Subsequent events may\nhave given some ertra credence to that theory, though. Mohan later\ncalled for Azhar to be rehabilitated in the Indian team after the\nIndependence Cup.\nTendulkar appeared to put all these cares behind him in India's\nopening match against New Zealand at Bangalore. The Kiwis had\nstunned Pakistan in the tournament opener at Mohali. Now their\nbowling was simply torn to pieces as India romped home by eight\nwickets. New Zealand scored  for  and India made the target in\n. overs. The captain's  and his opening stand of  with\nGanguly destroyed the bowling, especially medium-pacer Heath Davis\nwho was belted for , , ,  by Sachin in his third over.\nBut the wheels starting falling off the Indian campaign after that.\nThe next match in Mumbai was a replay of the previous year's World\nCup semi-final and once again, it was Sri Lanka who came out on top.\n'Get Tendulkar early' had by now become the winning mantra\nfor all opposing teams, and it was no different this time. The Indians\nnever recovered from losing both openers with just four on the board.\nGanguly was bowled first ball by Vaas and then in the fourth over\ncame the breakthrough the Sri Lankans had sought so eagerly. The\ncaptain was out for two in the fourth over, top edging a cut from\nSa~eeva de Silva straight into Kumara Dharmasena's hands at third\nman. Mter that it was SanathJayasuriya all the way; his unbeaten \nmade it a one-sided contest.\nThe key game of the tournament was inevitably the India-Pakistan\nclash at Chennai and it created a feast of runs and a world record. If\nPakistan came out on top by  runs, it was almost entirely thanks to\nopener Saeed Anwar's , which remains the highest score in an .\nPakistan's huge  for  was always going to be a challenge, and once\nTendulkar went early, this time for four, it was left to Rahul Dravid to\nkeep the match alive with his maiden century. Vinod Kambli ()\ngave him good support. But Pakistan's record total was beyond the\nConfrontation\n\n\n\n\fIndians. Anwar was helped considerably by the generosity shown by\nthe Indian captain in allowing him to use the speedy Shahid Mridi as\na runner after he had reached . The heat and humidity in the\nChepauk Stadium made the game as much a test of stamina as of skill.\nAnwar had a history of illness going into the match and was overcome\nby heat exhaustion and fluid loss, as were many other players. Having\nsomeone to do most ofhis running was no doubt a factor in his world\nrecord, though it took nothing away from his dazzling strokes and\ndomination of the bowling.\nIn the finals a few days later, Sri Lanka confirmed their status as\nworld champions by beating Pakistan -.\nThe simmering discontent between the Indian selectors and the\ncaptain exploded into the open when the team was announced for the\nAsia Cup to be held in Sri Lanka in July, the next stop in the crazy\nschedule that the Indians were subjected to in . It came down to\nthis-Tendulkar wanted Mongia and Kambli in the team, the selectors\ndid not. Back in were Azharuddin and Sidhu, with newcomer Syed\nSaba Karim replacing the experienced Mongia. Tendulkar was on his\nway to London to attend the international captains' annual meeting\nwhen he heard the news. In an interview over the phone to Kolkata\ndaily Aqj Kat, he declared that it was time to 'speak the truth', and that\n'lies do not serve any purpose'. But the statement that rocked Indian\ncricket was this: 'I've been given a B grade team.lt's not the best. It was\nimposed on me.'\nThe interview was, of course, splashed on the front page. Among\nother statements much out of character for the usually laconic and\nnon-controversial captain: 'I will not be a scapegoat anymore. Why\nshouldn't the captain get the team he wants when he receives the\nflak?'; 'I won't be used any longer. I'm going to speak the truth'; 'I'm\nnot enamoured of the captaincy. They can take it away. The Indian\nskipper is powerless'; It's my prerogative what I do on the field. I'm\nnot answerable (to the selectors).'\nA fortnight before this interview an extraordinary column under\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's byline, syndicated by Sunil Gavaskar's Professional\nManagement Group, had appeared in the Times cflndia ( June ).\nIt was largely a series ofjustifications for his captaincy record. And it\nhad appeared, surely not by coincidence, the day the selectors were\ndiscussing the captaincy. The article is reproduced in its entirety below.\nMumbai: By the end of the Indian cricket team's England tour\nof , my name was being mentioned for captaincy for the\nforthcoming season. Hence on the third day of the third Test\nmatch against England when captain Azharuddin reported unfit\nand I took charge of the team, my captaincy received special\nattention.\nMter India had ~cored  runs in the first innings it was\nexpected of me to put pressure on England by placing an\nattacking field and making proper bowling changes. Contrary\nto this, it appeared I was adopting tactics which had slowed\ndown the pace of the game. Obviously, my moves were not\nappreciated by cricket lovers.\nThe fact was that things were not so easy. Centuries scored by\nAtherton and Hussain reduced chances of our possible lead in\nthe first innings considerably. At this stage I thought it would\nbe unwise if we got England out quickly.\nThis would have made India bat in their second innings rather\ntoo early, which could have created problems for us. Rathore\nwas unfit to bat; Manjrekar and Mongia were to open the\ninnings and were not in good form; Ganguly and Dravid were\nplaying only their second Test; Azharuddin was injured and\nwas not in good form. He was to bat only if needed. I thought\none or two quick wickets could have changed the complexion\nof the game and the situation could have been reversed.\nThese two days of experience made me realise the ordeal of\ncaptaincy that I would have to face ifl was selected captain of\nthe team.\nI entered the test arena in  and today when I am at the\nhelm, I find most of the senior players Kapil Dev, Dilip\nConfrontation\n\n\n\n\fVengsarkar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Ravi Shastri, Manoj\nPrabhakar and Kiran More with whom I played at the start of\nmy career, have left the scene. Two experienced batsmen, Sidhu\nand Manjrekar, have been in and out of the side for some reason\nor the other.\nDuring the last year, the Indian team, barring Mohd.\nAzharuddin, Ani! Kumble, Nayan Mongia and Javagal Srinath\ncomprised of a large number of newcomers. Laxman, Abey\nKuruvilla, David Johnson, Dodda Ganesh and Noel David all\nmade their debut during the year. Rathore, Ganguly, Dravid,\nPrasad and Joshi had played hardly two to three Test matches.\nThis scenario clearly indicates that the team has been passing\nthrough a transitional period.\nFurther, Sidhu was not in the team until the tour of the West\nIndies. In the circumstances, Raman who had not played Test\ncricket for a long time, opened the innings in South Africa.\nSrinath's injury and subsequent return to India at the start of\nthe West Indies tour was a big blow to India's bowling attack.\nThe Test season began with victory in the solitary Test match\nagainst Australia; my first Test match as captain. Although I\nwas delighted we won, to be fair to Australia, they were playing\non a turning track which does not suit their style at all. But the\nvictory against South Mrica in the first Test at Ahmedabad\nmeant much more to me, from the viewpoint of captaincy.\nAt  runs for the loss offour wickets and  runs needed to\nwin, victory seemed within their reach. Their strategy, perhaps,\nwas to curb the spin ofKumblc and Joshi on the turning track.\nSensing this I decided to bring Srinath back into the attack,\nand it did the trick. In their second innings South Africa were\nall out for a meagre OS runs. In his interview after the match,\nskipper Hansie Cronje was generous enough to compliment\nme on my captaincy, and confessed that his team was not\nprepared mentally for this move.\nAt the start of the tour of South Mrica, we played only one\npractice match, a three-day match against a local team. The\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fwicket happened to be the slowest of all the wickets that we\ncame across on that tour. Mter Test matches at home, where we\nhad got used to playing on the front foot because of the low\nbounce on our wickets, we looked forward to getting some\npractice on the bouncy wickets in South Mrica. But it didn't\nhappen. South Africa simply crushed us in the first two Test\nmatches. Incidentally the wicket at Durban for the first Test\nwas perhaps the fastest that I have ever played on.\nPast records indicate that Indian teams have found it difficult\nto adjust their game or. foreign wickets and perform to the best\nof their ability at the beginning of the tour. At the same time\nthey have not only done better in the latter part of the tour but\nhave also won Test matches. It appears that we do take time to\nadjust. As if to prove this we came close to winning the third\nand final Test, but the rains came to South Mrica's rescue in\ntheir second innings on the last day. Two crucial hours between\nlunch and tea were washed out. At the end of the day South\nMrica had lost eight wickets, but had managed to save the game.\nOn that occasion weather had certainly deprived us of a win\nin South Africa; but let us not deprive ourselves of better\nperformances abroad by preparing fast and bouncy wickets at\nhome along with traditional turning wickets. Also we must\nplay more practice matches at the start of a tour; this will give\nthe team time to adjust to the conditions and more importantly\nto the pace bowlers abroad.\n\\Vhen we went to the West Indies, Srinath had to leave the\nteam because of a shoulder injury. For a five Test series we were\nleft with only two specialist bowlers in Prasad and Kumble.\nAbey Kuruvilla was making his debut; the other two bowlers,\nSunil Joshi and Dodda Ganesh, hadn't been in the playing\neleven regularly. Obviously most of the cricket lovers in this\ncountry ruled out our chances of even giving a good fight. But\nexcept for the first Test match when the West Indies took the\nlead and put us under pressure, in the remaining four matches\nConfrontation\n\n\n\n\fwe had the upper hand. This seemed to be overlooked in the\nlight of our failure to reach the target of  runs in the third\nTest at Barbados.\nI get a feeling that the assessment of our performance on the\ne~tire tour is being decided by the happenings on the fourth\nday.\nIn this match too we had put West Indies under pressure on\nthe first three days. We had taken a lead of runs in the first\ninnings and then skittled them out for a mere  odd runs.\nBut at the end of the third day the wicket had deteriorated\nconsiderably and the experts like Sunil Gavaskar, Geoff Boycott\nand Michael Holding were unanimous in their opinion, even\nbefore our innings started, that it was going to be very difficult\nto score those runs. The beginning of our second innings was\ngoing to be of the utmost importance. Sidhu got out first, to a\nperfectly-pitched ball which rose suddenly giving him no\nchance at all to defend. The ball hit him on the glove and went\nstraight into the hands of the gully fielder. The team's score\nhad not even reached double figures then.\nSidhu's wicket confirmed our doubts about the deteriorating\npitch. I will not blame the wicket entirely, but some accurate\nbowling, excellent field placing, and to some extent bad batting\ncontributed to our loss. I remember a similar situation when in\n one of the strongest batting line-ups ofan Australian team\ncomprising Greg Chappell, Doug Walters, Allan Border, Kim\nHughes, Graeme Wood, John Dyson and Rodney Marsh, could\nnot achieve a target of only  runs against India on a bad\nMelbourne wicket.\nAs I have mentioned earlier, our present team has many\nnewcomers who have played very few Test matches as yet. The\nteam needs time to improve and develop their skills.\nEven the  World Cup winning Sri Lankan team has\ndeveloped into a winning combination over a period of time\nand has reached such heights in one-day cricket only recently\nand in Test cricket too their present performances indicate that\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthey are a side to reckon with.\nThe first six players, Sanath Jayasuriya, Aravinda de Silva,\nGurusinghe, Arjuna Ranatunga, Roshan Mahanama and\nTillekratne of the Sri Lankan team had played around \nmatches each before the World Cup. Jayasuriya himself took\nalmost  matches to prove his potential, which in my mind\nwas never in doubt. I happened to witness his batting during\nSri Lanka's tour of India in -. He was not known to\nmany as a batsman of the calibre as he is known today. Also he\nused to bat lower down in the middle order. But even in those\ndays his ability of playing breath-taking strokes against the likes\nof Kapil Dev was enough to give proof of his talent.\nMter so many years of struggle, patience, and organized efforts\nthe Sri Lankans have struck a good performing combination.\nWe too are at the beginning of our efforts to build a young team\nof talented players. Let us continue.\nBy now the selectors were aware that they were not dealing with a\nrubber stamp, as Tendulkar's predecessor was often considered to be.\nHe was younger, with a mind of his own and obviously not afraid to\nspeak it. This did not go down well with the selectors, or at least some\nof them. Reportedly, the meeting took more than an hour to decide to\nretain him as captain and the vote could not have been closer: -.\nWhat saved him evidently was that there was no viable alternative at\nthat stage.\nThe panel at the time consisted of Ramakant Desai (chairman)\nSambaran Banerjee, Shivlal Yadav, Kishen Rungta and M.P. Pandove.\nThey were joined on  July for the team selection meeting in Bangalore\nby Tendulkar, Madan La! and BCC:l secretary J.Y. Lele. It was more\nthan two hours before the  were announced. When Desai was asked\nif he was happy with the way the meeting went, he said: 'I think so.'\nThree days later, Desai admitted in Mumbai that there had been a\nmajor dispute. He said he too wanted Kambli and Mongia in the team\nbut that they (Desai and Tendulkar) were helpless in the face of stiff\nopposition from the other selectors. (He would subsequently deny\nConfrontation\n\n\n\n\fthese comments.) 'Everybody agrees that Mongia is the best wicketkeeper in the business. The fact that he was not selected will create a\nlot of heartburn and soul searching,' Desai added.\nHowever, he questioned the credibility of the interview inAaj Kal.\n'Tendulkar has a wise head and knows the futility of crying over spilt\nmilk in public. If at all he had to speak, he would go guardedly about\nit and not scream from the roof top.' Reportedly, Desai z.nd Tendulkar\non two occasions during the stormy meeting lost their cool with the\nother selectors. Lele too was certain that Tendulkar would distance\nhimselffrom the interview and fall back on the 'I was misquoted' line\nso beloved oflndian cricketers and officials.\nIn fact, on reaching London, Tendulkar gave an interview to Press\nTrust ifIndia in which he virtually corroborated hisAaj Kal comments.\n'The skipper should get the team of his choice as it's his head which is\non the chopping block each time there is a reverse. The selectors\ndropped Kambli despite his innings of character during the\nIndependence Cup in Chennai.'\nThere were some half-hearted attempts to disassociate himself from\nthe stinging remarks by the time the Indians reached Colombo. But it\nwas a case of too little, too late. The general consensus was that\nTcndulkar was going public with his grievances over team selection\njust when his captaincy was under threat. It was felt that now he had\nmade his feelings clear, the selectors could not take action against him\nwithout it being perceived as an act of revenge. By this time, the meJia\nwas full of match-fixing, bookies and bribery revelations and by the\ntime the Indians landed in Colombo, former Pakistan captain Rashid\nLatif had named names in an interview from London.\nLatif claimed four Indians-Azharuddin, Sidhu, Venkatapathy\nRaju and Mongia-were involved in betting on matches. Azhar\nimmediately issued a denial and Latif too denied his earlier statement\nin a fax to the Indian team hotel, in which he claimed he had been\nmisquoted. But with the captain's remarks still ringing in their ears,\nthe team was not in the best of spirits and were routed by Sri Lanka in\nthe final of the Asia Cup. Madan Lal's public lashing of his team after\nthe defeat did not go down well either. While a gag order had been\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fplaced on the players speaking to the media, the coach gave an interview\nin which he castigated virtually every member of the team. Things\nwent from bad to worse on the tour, with the two Tests being drawn\nand Sri Lanka making it a clean sweep in the three-match  series.\nThe Indians returned empty-handed from a dismal tour.\nTendulkar was in form in the two Tests, scoring  in the first and\n in the first innings of the second. But all other feats were\novershadowed by Sri Lanka's world record total of for  wickets in\nthe first Test at the R.Premadasa Stadium. Roshan Mahanama ()\nand Sanath Jayasuriya () broke all partnership records for Test\ncricket with their second wicket stand of runs. The Indian bowling,\nstill without Srinath, had run out of answers. Indian cricket was at a\npretty low ebb. The year was turning out to be a disaster tor both the\nteam and the captain. The BCCI, under public pressure, constituted a\none-man enquiry commission to probe into the allegations of\ncorruption in Indiari cricket. But former Chief Justice Y.V.\nChandrachud came under a lot of fire for what turned out to be a farce\nand a whitewash. All the findings of the commission and the pious\npronouncements of the Board officials would be thoroughly exposed\nby the CBI report three years later.\nIronically, the first to be axed was not a cricketer, but a journalist.\nR.Mohan, the experienced and high-profile cricket correspondent for\nthe Hindu and the Sportstar for more than  years, was summarily\nsacked by his employees in the wake of rumours that he had links\nwith bookies.\nThe next stop on the Indians' whistle-stop calendar was Toronto, for\nthe second annual Sahara Cup  series against Pakistan. Considering\nwhat had transpired in the previous ten months, there was little scope\nfor optimism.\nBut it turned out to be the one silver lining in the dark clouds that\nhad gathered over Indian cricket. And the hero oflndia's successful\ncampaign was none other than Sourav Ganguly, the man who had\nbeen left fretting on the sidelines a year earlier, in Toronto. The Indian\nattack was pretty raw, with Srinath and Prasad both unfit and Kumble\nConfrontation\n\n\n\n\f'rested' by the selectors. Pakistan too were without their two strike\nbowlers, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. In the end, it was Ganguly's\ninnocuous medium-pacers that did the trick. They got him  wickets,\nincluding two in the third match which was declared a 'no-result' due\nto rain. No wonder the captain referred to him as the 'secret weapon'.\nAdded to these wickets was Ganguly's total of runs, more than\nenough to make him the obvious choice for Man of the Series.\nThe wickets were seamer friendly, and the batsmen struggled in\nthe first four matches. Pakistan captain Rameez Raja condemned them\nas unsuited to one-day cricket, and no wonder. His team was swept\naside in the first four matches, his own form plummeted, there were\nnon-cricketing problems for his team as well, and at the end of the\ntournament he was promptly sacked as captain. For once, India came\nout on top despite Tendulkar not being among the runs. It was not till\nthe last match that he managed to cross . 'As long as the team performs\nwell and wins matches, I don't worry about my batting. I would say\nthatthese wins against Pakistan have been the most satisfYing to me\nin my career,' said the winning captain.\nJust a week later, though, Pakistan would exact revenge, that too at\nhome. The Wills Challenge Cup series of three matches was the first\ntime since his debut in  that Tendulkar was playing in Pakistan.\nHis poor form continued with scores of,  and  and this was a\nfactor in Pakistan winning -. Beaten by five wickets in the first ODI\nat Hyderabad (Sind), India came storming h::tck to win the second at\nKarachi in the last over. Once again, Karachi lived up to its poor\ncrowd reputation and Tendulkar was forced to take his team off the\nfield after the third incident of stone throwing. Pakistan had reached\n for  in . overs at that stage. Ganguly once again did the star\nturn with  before Rajesh Chauhan hit Saqlain Mushtaq for a six in\nthe last over to make it safe for India. The decider at Lahore saw Ijaz\nAhmed blast the Indians out of the game and make it - for the home\nside.\nSri Lanka had been whitewashed - when they toured India in .\nNow,just three years later, they were a changed side after their epochal\n\n\nSachin\n\n\ftriumph in the World Cup the year before. This time, all the three\nTests they played in India were drawn. So was the ODI series, played on\nIndia's return from Sharjah. India won the first at Guwahati by se~\u00b7en\nwickets and lost the third at Margao by five. In between, the second at\nIndore had to be abandoned after just three overs because ofa dangerous\npitch. This meant that India had played  Tests Uust three at home)\nin  without a single victory, though at Mumbai in the third Test\nagainst Sri Lanka they were thwarted by rain when well on top, as had\nhappened earlier in the year in South Mrica.\nTendulkar was feeling the heat as pressure on his captaincy\nmounted. There was a campaign in certain sections of the media to\nbring back Azhar and by now the selectors, backed by some Board\nofficials, were gunning for him too. But all the talk of the captaincy.\naffecting his batting was nonsense, at least in Test matches. He had\nexactly  Test runs in the year at an average of ., with four\ns and three s. The ODI figures for the year, though, did show a\ndecline- runs in  matches at ., with two s and five\ns. And of those  matches, India had managed only ten wins. There\nwere  defeats as well as one tic and five 'no-results'. India's win\npercentage of. per cent fo; the year was below that of Kenya and\nabove only Bangladesh. It did not make for pretty reading.\nAt the end of the year, England sprang a surprise by winning the\nAkai Singer Champions Trophy four-nation tournament on only\ntheir third visit to Sharjah. This turned out to be the final nail in\nTendulkar's captaincy coffin. How it came about set new low standards\nfor intrigue even in the history oflndian cricket, which is replete with\nsuch sordid tales. India hit the depths, beaten by England (seven runs),\nPakistan (four wickets) and West Indies ( runs). To add to his\nhumiliation by the selectors, Tendulkar had also now been ordered to\nbat lower down the order. It did not do much good. He had scores of\n,  and . The nadir was reached in the third and final match against\nthe West Indies. Chasing for , India crumbled to . Azharuddin,\nfor one, appeared in a tearing hurry. His running between the wickets\nshocked everybody and it was no surprise when he was run out for\nfour, going for a non-existent second run. Sunil Gavaskar, commenting\nConfrontation\n\n\n\n\fon TV, summed up the feelings of every Indian cricket fan when he\nsaid: 'Azhar has just run hirr.self out of the Indian team.'\nThree weeks later, Azhar was to be appointed captain again.\n\n\n\nSachin \nGlobal Brand\n\nTendulkar works. -Hemant Kenkre\nWhen Sachin Tendulkar was signed up by World Tel chief Mark\nMascarenhas in October  for a five-year deal (starting in )\nworth $. million (Rs . crores), it made the front pages of all the\nnational papers in India. The sum was considered astronomical, more\nthan any other Indian sportsperson could have ever dreamed of, and\nwas of as much news value as another century from Indian cricket's\nlatest superstar. In May , the contract was renewed, this time\nreportedly for $. million. Eight months later, on  January ,\nMascarenhas was killed in a road accident near Nagpur. He was .\nIt was a shattering blow for Tendulkar. Mascarenhas had used his\nmarketing genius to transform his client's iconic status on the cric.~et\nfield into the number one brand name in the Indian marketplace~ His\ndeath came in the middle of the one-day series against England. 'I met\nhim as an agent, but he became a very close friend of mine,' said\nTendulkar. 'I had a very emotional relationship with him. I will never\nforget him because he always stood by me and wished well for me.\nOften, he went out of the way to make things comfortable for me.\nOverall he was more a family member than an agent.'\nTendulkar flew between one-day matches to Bangalore, where he\ndelivered a moving eulogy at St. Patrick's Chruch. 'He was like my\nelder brother,' Tendulkar said at the -minute service, attended by a\nlarge gathering. 'He always treated me as a family member.... He\nalways told me to concentrate on my cricket and never bother about\nthe commercial aspect and never forced me to do any commercials.'\n\n\fBy the time he died, Mascarenhas' s empire was beginning to show\nnumerous cracks. There had been income tax raids on his business\npremises in Bangalore and accusations of rigged telecast deals. The\nlast straw was when, at the height of the match-fixing scandal, he was\npublicly referred to as a 'bookie' by a Union minister. As usual, he\nthreatened to sue. His weekly magazine, Cruket Talk, and the website\ntotal-cmket.com, both launched in characteristically flamboyant fashion,\nhad shut down in six months in the wake of financial scandals. He had\nalso lost numerous V deals including telecast rightS in the lucrative\nSharjah market and had been left with the crumbs of only Bangladesh.\nA far cry from his glory days which began with the acquisition of\ntelecast rights to the  Wills World Cup. He had paid $ million\nfor the rights, and made twice that in profits.\nThe renewal of the contract with Tendulkar was seen as the last\nchance to salvage his business. He got the signature he wanted in the\nface of stiff competition from sports marketing giant IMG, who also\nmanage Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and the Williams sisters. It was\na measure of the faith Tendulkar had in him. 'I don't believe in what\nhas been said about Mark,' Tendulkar said in an interview, shortly\nafter renewing the deal. 'I am very comfortable working with him. He\nis a nice guy.'\n'Larger than life' was the phrase that popped up in almost every\nobituary. Binoo John, who had worked with Mascarenhas at Cricket\nTalk, used the most apt comparison in an article on the web site\nHllricket.com ( January ); he described Masceranhas as the\n'Don King oflndian cricket'.\n'He was tough as nails as a negotiator. But once he got you to sign\non the dotted line, he was the,perfect host. He made his clients feel like\nroyalty with lavish gifts and extravagant parties,' I was told by the\nmarketing man of a multinational company, who had extensive\ndealings with Mascarenhas.\nHe was also a man in a hurry, with flamboyant traits and\nidiosyncrasies, which would drive his colleagues to dismay. Many of\nthe obits were written by ex-employees who highlighted ~hese traits.\nDues had been left unpaid to employees and contributors after the\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fmagazine and website had folded up, including to some high-profile\ninternational cricketers. One person who worked with him told me\nthat Mascarenhas had a habit of booking four or five airline tickets in\na day. 'As the day wore on he would cancel one after the other. That\ngave him a sense of power. Then when it was time for his last flight he\nwould curse and howl at the poor driver to speed things up. That was\nMark for you.'\nWorldTel, with its base in Connecticut-where Sachin and his\nfamily enjoyed occasional holidays-was a one-man show.\nMascarenhas's ego and love for power and prestige meant he controlled\nthe day-to-day running of the company.\nIn an interview shortly after Tendulkar's contract was renewed in\n, Mascarenhas said he was initially attracted by the 'angelic\nquality' of his star client, evident in the few commercials he shot\nbefore . Mascarenhas, of course, used the 'national icon' cliche in\nabundance, and outlined his plans to merchandize the Tendulkar\nbrand name in a chain of restaurants. The idea has probably been put\nin cold storage now.\nThe entry of multinational companies into the Indian market after\nthe opening up of the economy in , the massive appeal cricket\nenjoys all over India, and the explosion in the number of one-day\nmatches combined with the birth of cable TV-were all factors in the\nmarketing success ofTendulkar. His clean image and status as a role\nmodel for the young generation, in particular, was the clincher. But\nback in , Mascarenhas's offer to him was perceived as a huge\ngamble. Many felt the World Tel chief had priced his client out of the\nmarket.\nIt was Ravi Shastri who first introduced Tendulkar to Mascarenhas\nin a Bangalore pub. The first deal was struck soon after that. 'I'm\nbetting on the power ofSachin and the power of the Indian economy,'\nMascarenhas said in an interview (Outlook,  November ). 'TV\nspending is growing at the rate of  per cent per annum. Even if you\naccount for  per cent inflation, that's a high figure.' In ,\nTendulkar was considered to be in the second rung of cricket's\nsuperstars, a shade behind Brian Lara and Shane Warne. But the\nGlobal Brand\n\n\n\n\fTendulkar mania went from strength to strength in the intervening\nyears and the Bangalore-born maverick businessman got handsome\nreturns on his canny investment.\nThe brands Tendulkar currently endorses represent a wide variety\nof products. Only liquor and cigarettes have always been taboo. 'If\npeople look up to me, I've got to set the right example,' he said in an\ninterview to the Telegraph (). The public today identifies him by\nhis V commercials for Pepsi, Adidas, Fiat and a host of others, as\nmuch as for his cricketing achievements. That is, of course, what the\nmarketing men aim for.\nThe car industry has been going through a recession jn India with\na glut of new models flooding the market and most flopping miserably.\nIt took an Italian manufacturer to cash in on the Tendulkar magic. As\na result, the Fiat Palio is the only car for which there is a waiting list. A\nhigh-priced limited signature edition (the S) was unveiled in early\n and was snapped up in a jiffy. Never mind that Tendulkar's\nfavourite cars are his two Mercedes Benz luxury models (a silver SL\nand a maroon C AMG-he has a passion for driving them\nhimself). As far as the buying public is concerned, Pialo is at the top of\nhis list.\nReportedly, Tendulkar's contract is worth Rs  crorcs per year.\n(Amitabh Bachchan is said to earn Rs  crores annually from the\nMaruti Versa ad campaign.) Mter the first contract was finalized in\n, Mascarenhas claimed in an interview that only Tendulkar and\nBachchan had the power to endorse everything from bicycles to luxury\ncars, 'but Bachchan has faded away and Sachin has just risen'.\nIt's doubtful whether Tendulkar has ever ridden a two-wheeler,\nexcept perhaps bicycles in his schooldays. That did not stop him from\nendorsing the lVS Ltd. range of motorbikes. The deal was struck in the\nwake of the Sourav Ganguly/Hero Honda endorsement. Then,just\nbefore the  Wills World Cup, the Chennai-based MRF tyre\ncompany proposed a bat logo deal. It was clinched in a matter of\nseconds. This has been one of the most lucrative and high-profile\ndeals for Sachin. The back ofhis broad bat is prime advertising space.\nHe had some problems initially in regard to ICC regulations. But now,\n\n\nSac hi n\n\n\fthe world cricket body has ratified such logos and MRF have since\nsigned up Steve Waugh as well. Every other deal is peanuts compared\nto the original one, though.\nIfTendulkar is known as the 'god oflndian cricket' (one ad even\ndepicted him in a Lord Krishna-like avatar), thenAlyque Padamsee is\nconsidered the 'god' of the world oflndian advertising. This is what\nPadamsee told me about the Tendulkar marketing phenomenon:\n'When a cricketer achieves the status of Don Bradman, he becomes a\nglobal brand. In other words, he is instantly recognizable as the Coke\nbottle or the Marlboro Cowboy. He becomes more than a personality.\nHe becomes a saleable persona. Sachin and Gavaskar have both\nimprinted themselves on the global emotional retina.'\n'What does money mean to you?' Tendulkar was asked by Sanjay\nKarhade in the Times if India Sunday Review ( June ).\nI guess it is important. But it doesn't mean you can do anything\nto earn it. I play cricket from the bottom of my heart because I\nenjoy it a great deal and I am compensated in the process. One\nthing most people do not understand is that I started playing at\nthe age of . Do you think at that age, any kid can think of the\nmoney aspect of the game? You will see thousands of kids\nplaying cricket, do you think they have money on their mind?\nThere is no doubt that companies that sign on Tendulkar for\nastronomical sums get more than their money's worth. Fiat is just\none example. Adidas, the German sports clothing and equipment firm,\nis another. 'Adidas has grown by over % after signing on Tend ulkar\nin ,' according to Managing Director Tarun Kunzru (Mid Day,\n June ). 'Growth has been significant and one reason could be\nthe association between Adidas and Sachin.' More than just 'one\nreason', one suspects!\nInterviewed for the same article, marketing man Hemant Kenkre\n(Tendulkar's captain at the CCI in the late s) had this to say:\n'Sachin's a real person, someone who delivers imagery with attitudenot some \"make believe\" screen persona who acts a part. That's what\nGlobal Brand\n\nliS\n\n\fa brand Is all about-being real with imagery, attitude and delivery.\nTendulkar works.'\nHe certainly does-even with that squeaky, boyish voice he has\nhad since childhood. The current list of endorsements includes Visa,\nBritannia, Pepsi, Fiat, Adidas, MRF, TVS and Boost. His first, for Action\nShoes ten years ago, earned him Rs lakhs a year. Now the money is\nin the region ofRs  crores.\nSachin's wife Anjali, her father Anand Mehta, and his elder brother\nAjit are known to handle deals on Sachin's behalf WorldTel steps in to\nfinalize the arrangement. Tendulkar is thus free to concentrate on\ncricket. Sachin, of course, has the final say. 'His strength is that he\nlistens carefully and he knows very clearly what he wants to do and\nwhat he doesn't,' Mascarenhas said in . 'Is there a parallel to\nTendulkar on the cricket field? So judge it from there,' was his\ncomment in Mid Day ( May ) when asked, 'Would you say this\ndeal will be unparalleled in the history of world cricket?'\nThe renewed contract also saw a new-look Sachin appearing in\ncommercials for the likes of Home Trade, with the Sydney Cricket\nGround as a backdrop. Gone were the boyish curls, in was the goatee,\ncomplete with designer stubble and a new hairstyle-the dose-cropped\nlook known as the 'Caesar cut'. The boy-to-man image makeover was\nhandled by 'Team Tendulkar': hair stylist Monisha Naegamvala,\nphotographer Atul Kasbekar, fashion consultant Rocky S. (credited\nwith styling the new look) and ad film-maker Prahlad Kakkar.\n'Sachin had a great recall value among men and kids. But after the\nHome Trade commercials, even women go \"wow Sachin\",' said Kasbekar\nin an article on the Sachin makeover in the Times if India Sunday\nReview ( October  ). Though he looked stiff in the early\ncommercials, Sachin is now comfortable in front of the camera. He\ncomes across as a natural. It was not always like that, as he himself\nadmits. He used to get nervous in the beginning and it took him a\nwhile to relax before the camera and be himself. It was, after all, a\nwhole new ball game.\nSachin's priorites in life have always been clear: Family, cricket\nand commercials-in that order. His life is cricket, but not without\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fhis family. They go with him everywhere. What he does off the ground\nis private .... And only when he has enough time to switch off from\ncricket or when he's not playing the game does he do commercials,\nnever in the middle of a cricket series.\nIn the seven years since the first edition of this book was published,\nthere have been significant changes in 'Brand Sachin'.\nThe most important of these came in May  with his threeyear deal with new management firm, Ico nix, the marketing wing of\ninternational advertising giant Saatchi & Saatchi. The deal was\nreportedly worth $ million and came a year after his -year deal\nwith World Tel had expired.\nTendulkar's stature in the Indian team had by now matured into\nthat of senior statesman. This was reflected in the products he began\nto endorse.\nPepsi was one of the first to drop him, switching to their 'youngistan' campaign theme led by the likes of M.S. Dhoni and Yuvraj\nSingh.\nThe nature of his portfolio evolved from soft drinks and sporting\ngoods to banking and insurance, reflecting his image of family man\nand senior statesman rather than youth icon.\n\nGlobal Brand\n\n",
    "1999-2003": " Trauma\n\nNever leave something that you can do to someone else.-Sunil Gavaskar\nAt the start of , all the talk in cricket and political circles was\nwhether or not the Pakistanis would make it to India for a Test series\nfor the first time since . The ruling BharatiyaJanata Party had to\novercome a dissenting voice in their coalition, from the Shiv Sena,\nand not for the first time either. In , the Shiva Sena had dug up\nthe pitch at the Wankhede Stadium in their stronghold of Mumbai,\nforcing the series against Pakistan to be cancelled. The proposed tours\nof  and  were cancelled too, in the wake of political protests.\nIn , the World Cup organizers made sure not to allot any of the\nknockout stage matches to Mumbai in case one of them turned out to\nbe an India-Pakistan clash-which is exactly what occurred in the\nquarter-finals, allotted to Bangalore. As a result, Mumbai cricket fans\nhad to be content with the India v Australia league match.\nThe Shiv Sena were up to their old tricks this time, too. In a carefully\nplanned pre-dawn raid-having made sure a bevy of reporters,\ncameramen and photographers had been informed in advance-they\nproceeded to dig up the pitch at the Feroze Shah Kotla in New Delhi,\nthe venue of the first Test. As a result, venues had to be switched and\nChennai hosted the first Test; the second (and final) Test moved to the\ncapital. The Pakistanis would also stay on to play a Test at Kolkata as\npart of the inaugural Asian Test championships and then a triangular\none-day series with India and Sri Lanka. Mter that it would be off to\nSharjah. So India-Pakistan cricket was very much the flavour of the\nseason-all this in the run-up to the big event, the World Cup in\n\n\fEngland.\nThe huge strain on the Indian cricketers would continue for\nanother year-since , they had played a phenomenal number of\nmatches. But this was the last thing on the minds of the politicians\nand the game's administrators. What mattered was that the Pakistan\ntour oflndia should go off without a hitch. In the end, the series was\ndrawn - and there was much goodwill all around. There was some\nfantastic cricket too, to match the victories on the diplomatic front.\nIn , in the last India v Pakistan Test on Indian soil, Pakistan\nhad prevailed by  runs at Bangalore despite an epic  by Sunil\nGavaskar. The target for India, then, was . Now,  years'later,\nhistory would repeat itself in another southern city where Pakistan\ncame out on top by  runs. And it was the turn ofGavaskar's successor\nto the tag of'Little Master' to script an epic innings in vain. 'Another\nGreek tragedy' was how one Indian writer described the Test, as India\nfell just short of the victory target of.\nIt was certainly an amazing four days of cricket at the MA\nChidambaram Stadium at Chepauk, Chennai-scene of the second\ntied Test in . The Indians had got back from New Zealand just a\nweek earlier and were now plunged into a Test that was gripping from\nstart to finish. The first day's honours belonged to the hosts. Pakistan\nwere shot out for  with Ani) Kumble picking up six wickets in a\nharbinger of things to come. India were  tor no loss at stumps, with\ndebutant opener S.Ramesh delighting his home crowd with a flurry\nof boundaries offWasim Akram and Wagar Younis. On the second\nday, Tendulkar perished to the third ball he faced, caught by Salim\nMalik at gully offSaqlain Mush tag for a rare duck, as he attempted an\nambitious shot. The Pakistanis were beside themselves with joy and\nSag lain's  for  restricted the Indian lead to .\nThis time it was the turn ofVcnkatesh Prasad to do the damage\nwith the ball; he claimed six wickets. Tendulkar too made a couple of\nimportant breakthroughs by accounting for Inzamam-ui-Haq and\nYousufYouhanna, whom he had dismissed in the first innings, too.\nDespite a maiden Test century by Shahid Afridi, Pakistan collapsed\nfrom  for  to  all out and the target for India was . On a\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fpitch that had turned from day one, it was not likely to be an easy task.\nThat India got so close was almost entirely due to Tendulkar and\nhis partnership of for the sixth wicket with Nayan Mongia. Only\none other batsman reached double figures (Dravid: ). With Saqlain\nagain collecting five wickets and Waqar and Wasim striking vital blows,\nIndia were tottering at  for  when Tendulkar was joined by the\nwicketkeeper. What transpired was intensely competitive cricket as\nthe last recognized pair for India sought to keep out the rampaging\nPakistani bowlers. It brought the crowd, silenced by the batting\ncollapse, back to life. Tendulkar revealed a new facet of his supreme\nbatsmanship-the ability to graft for runs and play a long innings.\nNot that he could resist attacking the bowlers. Saqlain went tor four\nfours in an over and both Wasim and Waqar felt the full power of his\nstrokes. In the same over, he had a big slice of luck when on  he\ncharged the off-spinner, got an inside edge and saw keeper Moin Khan\ndrop the catch and miss the stumping, too.\nBy the time he reached his eighteenth century-his first against\nPakistan, in his sixty-fifth Test-panic was beginning to surface in the\nrival camp. Runs were flowing freely. At the other end, Mongia was\nproviding Tendulkar with admirable support. But by now, Sachin was\nin obvious pain. He could be seen clutching his back and agony was\nevident on his face when he played his shots. India were just  runs\naway from a famous victory when Mongia had a rush of blood and\npaid the price. He made a wild slog te> mid-off from the bowling of\nAkram and was caught by Y<mnis for . At the other end, Tendulkar\nwas seething with rage at the sight of the rash shot. It would be a long\ntime before he could bring himself to forgive his teammate.\nThirty-sLx runs were added in the company of Sunil Joshi before\nTendulkar, hampered by back spasms, threw away his wicket after an\ninnings spanning  minutes and  balls. Desperate to finish the\nmatch before being overcome by pain, he took a swipe at Saqlain and\nwas held by Akram at mid-off for  at  for .\nThis was just the breach the Pakistanis were looking for and the\nrest of the Indian batting subsided meekly to hand over victory to the\necstatic Pakistanis. In the despondent Indian dressing room, Tendulkar\nTrauma\n\n\n\n\fwas a shattered man. He had battled the heat, the pain and \ndetermined Pakistanis to take his side to the doorstep of victory. That\nhe could not complete the task is something that has haunted him\neversmce.\n'I should have reached the target myself. I was striking the ball\nwell but when the strain aggravated, I could not go through with the\nfollow through. Every time I tried, the pain increased,' he said after his\nepic. Looking on was Raj Singh Dungarpur. 'I saw Gundappa\nVisvanath make an undefeated  in a score of  at Chepauk against\nthe West Indies (in ). I would rate Tendulkar's innings in adverse\ncircumstances above that. Because we know Tendulkar as an attacking\nbatsman. It is ingrained in him. Today he showed us all a different\nfacet which should make Capt. Hazare, Visvanath and Sunil Gavaskar\nproud,' he said (Sportstar,  February ).\nThat  not out against a rampaging Andy Roberts and Gavaskar's\n against Pakistan have long been rated as the best Indian innings\nagainst pace and spin. Now Tendulkar was nudging them off the\npedestal. But it's interesting to note that only Visvanath's masterpiece\nhad resulted in an Indian victory.\nFour days later, the teams were in New Delhi for the second Test.\nThere was speculation whether Tendulkar would be able to play. It\nwas obvious that he was not fully fit, and the final decision was left to\nthe batsman himself. The feeling in the Indian camp was that even a\npartially fit Tendulkar would be a psychological boost to the side after\nhis masterly display at Chepauk. Though he did eventually make it to\nthe side, he played only a minor role ( and ) in India's decisive win\nby  runs.\nThe match will go down in cricket history for Anil Kumble's\nfantastic feat in the Pakistan second innings of taking all ten wickets,\nonly the second man to do so after Jim Laker against Australia in .\nThe first triangular Test tournament since , the Asian Test\nchampionship, the brainchild ofjagmohan Dalmiya, got off to a stormy\nstart at Kolkata less than a fortnight after Kumble's 'Perfect Ten'. It was\nIndia v Pakistan again in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of Eden\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fGardens. The first four days attracted crowds in excess of ,. Yet,\nthe end of the Test was played out in front of empty stands.\nThat Pakistan eventually won by  runs was astonishing,\nconsidering they found themselves in the doldrums at  for  after\nnine overs from Srinath and Prasad on the first morning. Then came\nthe first of many fight-backs by the Pakistanis as they reached  all\nout. India, in its innings, tumbled from  for  to  all out. Shoaib\nAkhtar created a sensation by bowling Tendulkar for a first ball duck,\nknocking out his middle stump through sheer pace. It was the third\n'golden' duck ofSachin's Test career stretching over a decade. With\nhis previous ball, the fast bowler had bowled Dravid for .\nThe third day belonged to Saeed Anwar and Srinath, both of whom\nrecorded career-best performances. The left-handed opener carried\nhis bat for , the highest score by a Pakistani in India, while Srinath\nreturned figures of for  for a match haul of wickets. India were\nleft to chase  for victory.\nOn the fourth day, Tendulkar came to the wicket at  for ,\nopeners Ramesh and VVS. Laxman having put on  runs. He began\nconfidently with a four off Akram, when disaster struck on the\nthirteenth delivery he faced, also from Akram, which he punched to\nmidwicket. Substitute Nadeem Khan (on for Anwar) made an\nastonishing throw from  yards as Sachin went for the third run, his\neyes on the trajectory of the ball. As a result, he did not notice Akhtar\nwho had positioned himself near the stumps for the throw. The two\ncollided and the bat got tangled between the fielder's legs. It was\ngrounded for a split second before the collision which knocked it into\nthe air, even as the throw crashed into the stumps. West Indies umpire\nSteve Bucknor consulted his colleague Dave Orchard of South Mrica\nand third umpire K. T.Francis was called in. Francis pressed the\ndreaded red button and a dejected Tendulkar started the walk back.\nAzharuddin came to the crease as the crowd roared in fury, accusing\nAkhtar of having deliberately obstructed Tendulkar. Instead of\nretreating to the dressing room, Tendulkar stormed into the TWI TV\ncontrol room to watch the replays in the company of match referee\n'Cammie' Smith. Neither was allowed to express his views but\nTrauma\n\n\n\n\fTendulkar could be seen shaking his head while Smith draped a\nconsoling arm around him. Play had already resumed and there was\nno way the decision could have been reversed. But by now missiles\nwere raining down on the fielders and Akram led his team off.\nICC presidentJagmohan Dalmiya, in his own backyard, persuaded\nTendulkar to accompany him round the ground in a bid to pacify the\ncrowd. Mter a break of over an hour, play re-started, though the crowd\nand the Indian camp were still seething. So, was the decision correct\nor not? The rule book states a batsman can be given not out in such a\nsituation only if he leaves the crease to avoid the possibility ofbeing\ninjured. That was not the case, as Tendulkar had not spotted Akhtar in\nhis path. The only question which remained unanswered was whether\nAkhtar had deliberately obstructed the batsman's path.\nRaju Bharathan, writing in the Sportstar ( March ), certainly\nthought so.\nShoaib Akhtar was showing himself to be no more than a skilful\npractitioner of the modern-day stratagem of'crossing the path'\nof the batsman (running to the bowler's end) in such an artful\nway as to make it look as if he was doing nothing more than\nposturing himself to receive the Nadeem Khan throw. That\nAkhtar (from the pin pointed corner ofhis left eye) saw Sachin\ncome dashing down and created that 'gap' between his legs for\nendulkar's bat to 'find', is a fact. But then nothing that Akhtar\ndid here could be legally viewed as the action replay of a man\nstudiedly blocking Sachin's way.\nPakistan captain Wasim Akram could have exercised his\nprerogative and withdrawn the appeal, though there would have been\nall hell to pay across the border ifhe had done so. Reportedly, Pakistan\nmanager Shahryar Khan (a career diplomat) and Pakistan Cricket\nBoard chairman Khalid Mehmood were keen to make the gesture of\ngettiJg Tendulkar recalled. But coach Javed Miandad put his foot\ndown and the decision stayed.\nJt is doubtful if the crowd would have reacted the way it did if the\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fbatsman had been any other than their favourite. VSrivatsa captured\nthe mood well when he wrote in the Times ifIndia: 'Tendulkar is the\nbody and soul of Indian cricket, Every time he gets out cheaply his\nteammates and millions of cricket fans miss a heartbeat or two and\ntoday their hearts must have ached seeing the way he got out.'\nSadly, there was more trouble on the final morning. India needed\n to win with four wickets in hand. And the match ended up being\nplayed virtually 'in camera' with only the media, officials and club\nmembers present after the spectators had been brutally chased away\nby the Kolkata police. Stones and other objects were once again hurled\non to the ground when three quick wickets fell and India were on the\nbrink, at  for . Dalmiya was adamant that there would not be a\nrepeat of the  World Cup semi-final. A recurrence would have\nproved a huge embarrassment and could have resulted in the\nblacklisting ofKolkata as an international venue.\nSo, three hours of police action later, the game resumed. It lasted\nonly ten minutes and folloWing Akhtar's removal oflast man Venkatesh\nPrasad, the frenzied Pakistani celebrations began.\nSubsequently, a high-scoring draw ensued in Colombo between\nIndia and Sri Lanka. Tendulkar's nineteenth century on the final day\nmust have also been one ofhis easiest (and most unsatisfying), as the\nmatch was dead and buried by then.\nPakistan were already assured of a place in the final when they\ntook on Sri Lanka in the last league match at Lahore. Determined to\nensure that India would not meet them in the final at Dhaka, they\ncynically gifted away bonus points to Sri Lanka. The final, four days\nlater, was a cakewalk as Pakistan romped home by an innings and \nruns. But the manner of their victory left a sour taste.\nBy now, the strain on Tendulkar's back was going from bad to\nworse. The World Cup was not far away and yet, there lay ahead of the\nteam even more one-day tournaments. The Pepsi tri-series with\nPakistan and Sri Lanka at home was to be played in March and the\nBCCI was frantically trying to dispel all talk of Tendulkar's injury\nkeeping him out of action-perhaps to keep the sponsors quiet. Three\nweeks before the opening match, the inimitable Board secretary J.Y.\nTrauma\n\n\n\n\fLele came up with one o(his characteristic comments on the issue.\nThe report that Sachin's family wanted him to take a break was, he\nsaid, 'absolutely bogus. It is absurd and there is no truth in it at all.'\nNeedless to say, the 'bogus' statement turned out to be true, and a\nreluctant Indian team went through their paces, to be beaten by\nPakistan in the final.\nThere had been rumblings of dissent within the Indian camp about\nthe event, with many players feeling the strain of so much non-stop\ncricket. The Board, though, would have none of it. The result was a\nseries of listless performances by a jaded Indian team ag:tinst the\nrampaging Pakistanis. From there it was back to Sharjah and another\ntri-series, this time with Pakistan and England, just a month before\nthe start of the World Cup in England. Once again, India were without\nthe still-resting Tendulkar, and once again they lost in the final to\nPakistan.\nBut there was another honour for Sachin that year. On  March\n, he was back at the Rashtrapati Bhavan for another 'audience'\nwith President K.R. Narayanan. This time, it was to receive the Padma\nShri, India's fourth highest civilian honour. 'I am very proud of you\nand carry on the good work,' were the President's words as he handed\nover the award.\nWill he, won't he?' was the question for millions offans. With the\nWorld Cup round the corner, the speculation over Tendulkar's fitness\nreached fever pitch. He had flown to England for treatment from a\nback specialist. It was thought the intense heat and humidity in\nChennai might have triggered off the pain. There was a huge sigh of\nrelief, not only from India but the whole cricket world, when he was\ndeclared fit for the World Cup. But after the trauma of the back injury,\ntragedy was lurking round the corner.\n\n\n\nSachin\n\n Tragedy and Tears\n\nIt was my mother who prompted me to go and attend the nation's call.\n-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nThe World Cup returned to England in  after  years. In ,\nthe Indian team led by Kapil Dev had stunned the world by lifting the\nPrudential World Cup. The media and the advertising hype in India\nin the run-up to cricket's biggest event was simply mind-boggling. lL\nseemed that every company worth its salt, from manufacturers of\ntelevisions to soft drinks and everything else in between, had spent\ntheir annual ad budgets in one massive splurge on cricket. The sum\nbeing tossed around was a staggering Rs  crores.\nExpectations were sky-high and the atmosphere was one ofhysteria.\nCertainly, the Indian team had done little, either at home or abroad, to\njustify such enthusiasm. The stars of  also had their day in the\nsun once again. There were reunions galore, and even a match pitting\nthe team of  against the team of  at Mumbai. Sachin\nTendulkar was the star-again-with a century. Which only confirmed\nwhat he had said a few years earlier-that he took his batting seriously\neven in exhibition matches.\nOnce again, Azharuddin led the team, as he had done in  and\n. There was no doubt in anybody's mind, though, about where\nthe team's hopes actually rested. In May , Tendulkar made it to\nthe cover of the Asian edition ofTtme magazine ( May ). Inside,\nthe players expected to dominate the tournament were profiled.\n\n\fThe Bombay Bomber's blazing batting performances have\nearned him comparisons with Diego Maradona-it helps that\nthey are both short, stocky and curly-haired. But unlike the\nArgentine ace, Tendulkar is a levelheaded, even bland\nprofessional who does all his hell-raising at the wicket. He\nwields the heaviest bat in the game, both literally and\nfiguratively and is a quick reader of bowlers and wicket\nconditions. Ask Shane Warne: regarded by most batsmen as\nunplayable, the leg spinner was brutalized by Tendulkar\nthroughout the  Australian tour of India. Later, Warne\nsaid he had nightmares about Tendulkar's flashing blade.\nIt's difficult to single out a standout Tendulkar performance,\nas there are so many-and so many to come. He already owns\nthe record for most om centuries, and he has at least  years\nahead of him. Gulp!\nIndia were in Group A with hosts England, Kenya, South Mrica,\nholders Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Group B consisted of Australia,\nNew Zealand, West Indies, Pakistan, Scotland and Bangladesh. The\ntop three teams from each group would advance to the Super Six stage\nunder a complex system of points and the top four would then go on to\nthe semi-finals.\nIndia's opening match at Hove on  May was against South Mrica,\none of the favourites. India started well after electing to bat first and\nTendulkar () and Ganguly () put on  runs. Tendulkar was\ncaught behind off Lance Klusener,just after striking a delightful cover\ndrive to the boundary. The final total of for  was a challenging\none. Openers Gary Kirsten and Herschelle Gibbs were both claimed\nby Srinath with the score at  before Jacques Kallis took over. When\nhe was run out for , South Mrica needed  from  balls. Klusener,\nthe new man in, promptly struck the first three deliveries for four and\nhis team were home by four wickets with . overs to spare.\nIt was a disappointing start to the Indian campaign. But then, South\nMrica were undoubtedly one of the strongest teams in the tournament.\nThe next match, four days later, at Leicester, was against Zimbabwe\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fand the Indian camp was confident it would earn its first points. It was\nnot to be. Not only did the Mrican team stun India in a last-over\nthriller, but there was an even more disturbing piece of news for\nTendulkar the night before the game. His father, Dr Ramesh\nTendulkar, had died in Mumbai ofa heart attack in his home in Bandra,\nlate on  May, at the age of . He had been ailing for some time.\nMy first thought on hearing the news was the same that must have\ncrossed the minds of millions oflndian cricket fans-would Sachin\ncontinue at the World Cup or return home? I immediately felt a pang\nof guilt for thinking so, and I am sure I was not alone in that either.\nSachin did indeed return to Mumbai to attend his father's funeral and\nmissed the match against Zimbabwe. He left in the early hours of \nMay with tears in his eyes. Few in the team were aware of what had\nhappened. At . in the night, coach Anshuman Gaekwad took the\ncall from Mumbai, and was asked to convey the tragic news to Sachin.\nBut he did not have the heart to do so, and turned to Anjali for help.\nBoth Anjali and daughter Sara were in London at the time. The three\ntook the first available flight home from London, early on the morning\nof the Zimbabwe match.\nIronically, it was at Leicester (which has a large Indian population)\nthat Dr Tendulkar, ten years earlier, had given a lecture on Marathi\nliterature. He had retired six years ago from Kirti College in Mumbai,\nwhere he taught Marathi. He had also taught at Sidharth College.\nSachin's brothers Ajit and Nitin had been with the team at Hove.\nThey were in Chicago when they received the news.\nEven as the demoralized Indians were self-destructing against\nZimbabwe, the talk on the streets centred on the tragedy. It was as if\nthe nation was in collective grieving with their favourite son. The\nplayers had woken up on the morning of May, stunned to hear the\nnews and learn of their teammate's distress and departure.\nUnderstandably, Gaekwad was in no mood to ask Sachin if and when\nhe planned to return. There was no pressure from the Board either. 'I\nknow how close he was to his father. We have to wait for the funeral\nbefore we can even think of asking him. I shall keep in touch with\nhim,' the coach told the reporters from India.\nTradgedy and Tears\n\n\n\n\fA minute's silence was observed before the match at the Grace\nRoad ground. S.Ramesh had the unenviable task of replacing\nTendulkar at the top of the order and he did a more than competent\njob as he top-scored with . All through the flight from London to\nMumbai, Sachin's mind was on the progress ofhis team. One of the\nflight pursers kept coming to him with the latest score. 'Through him\nI came to know that we lost closely. I was sorry I could not do anything\nunder the circumstances.' Chasing Zimbabwe's  for , India who\nhad been docked four overs for a slow over-rate by their old nemesis,\nmatch referee 'Cammie' Smith, lost by three runs with their last three\nwickets thrown away in the final over bowled by Henry Olonga.\nBack in Mumbai, the funeral of Prof. Tendulkar was a family affair\nwith just a few close friends (Vinod Kambli and Amol Muzumdar)\nand Mumbai cricket officials in attendance. The time had been\nbrought forward to dawn to avoid the media scramble. A sign was put\noutside the family residence, requesting people not to pay their\ncondolences. Eldest son Nitin performed the last rites at the Shivaji\nPark electric crematorium in Central Mumbai. The mourners were\npersonally thanked by Sachin who stood at the exit along with Ajit.\nIn a touching tribute under the headline, 'God Rewarded Prof.\nTendulkar', Sunil Gavaskar wrote in the Times ifindia ( May ):\nThe late Ramesh Tendulkar did not watch too many ofhis son,\nSachin's innings at a cricket ground. Even at home he used to\nwatch the highlights rather than the live coverage on TV.\nNow he would have seen how not only millions and millions\nofindians but even the Gods stop everything to watch his son\nplay. He now has a special place to see his youngest son go on to\nbecome the greatest batsman the world has ever seen.\nGavaskar recalled how Prof Tendulkar (when he was teaching at\nSidharth College in the s and s) helped the cricketers of\nBombay University. 'He would take extra classes and tuition for these\ncricketers [who were playing in the inter-varsity Vizzy Trophy] to\nensure that they were able to catch up with their studies and get\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthrough and not lose a year. So when young Tendulkar started to bat\nthe way he does, plenty of people who knew about the senior\nTendulkar's contribution were sure it was God's way of rewarding\nhim with a son as talented as Sachin.'\nPro\u00a3 Tendulkar had last been seen in public with Sachin and Anjali\nat a cricket awards function in Mumbai a month before his death. A\nlow-profile man, he stayed out of the spotlight even as he watched his\nson grow up to become a national icon.\nAtmaram 'Bapu' Bhende, the doyen ofMarathi theatre, had known\nPro\u00a3 Tendulkar for many decades. Mr Bhende is married to my father's\nsister, Dr Asha Bhende. (In September , when I metAJit Tendulkar\nin Mumbai and told him of the relationship, his reaction was, 'Bapu?\nHe is a great legend.') I asked Mr Bhende to share with me his\nmemones.\nMr Bhende recalled in a letter sent to me in November , how\nhe first met Ramesh Tendulkar when he invited him to attend a kavi\nsammelan (poets' meet) organized by the Indian National Theatre (of\nwhich he was secretary of the Marathi section) in the mid-s.\nI was charmed by his gentle, soft spoken and cordial manner. A\ntrue gentleman, ever ready to extend a helping hand to anyone\nwho needed it. I was particularly impressed by his frank but\nwithout malice opinions of the work of other poets. I was\nparticularly interested in bringing together budding poets with\nthe specific intention of bringing them into the limelight.\nRamesh Tendulkar was helpful in identifying such poets and\ncontacting them .... Those who knew Ramesh Tendulkar\nintimately, know that Sachin's modesty is a gift from his father.\nI met Ramesh quite accidentally just a few days before his\nuntimely death. We were both invited to a suburban college\nliterary function. The car organized by them first picked up\nRamesh and then arrived at my residence. Ramesh rushed into\nmy living room and we met like two long lost friends. Certainly,\na moment to cherish. And remember, Ramesh had not\nchanged-the same handsome face, winsome smile, the same\nTradgedy and Tears\n\n\n\n\fwarmth, the same genuine friendliness. The long years in\nbetween just melted away.\nOne seldom comes across such a straightforward and\nunassuming person, who in reality had so much to boast o\u00a3\nHis death was not only a great loss to his family and the Marathi\nliterary world, but also to his large circle of friends, admirers\nand well wishers.\nSince his death, his children have brought out a book of his\nMarathi poems. The eldest, Nitin, is also a poet, obviously inspired by\nhis father.\nMeanwhile, the Indian World Cup campaign appeared to be\nheading for an early and inglorious end after two defeats in the first\ntwo matches. In India, there were strident calls for Azharuddin to be\naxed before the next game against Kenya on  May. Passions were\nrunning high and the phone calls from viewers to the morning\ntelevision show I hosted, were getting increasingly irate and abusive.\nI realized just how ugly things had become when a furious fan at a\npetrol station near the studios accosted me. He demanded to know\nwhy I was calling for the Indian captain to be retained.\nBack in Mumbai, Sachin had made the decision to fly back to\nEngland. The news came as a huge relieffor the team and its followers.\nFor  hours after his father's funeral, it seemed no one could talk of\nanything else. At the Times q[India office in the heart of New Delhi,\ntraffic came to a standstill. 'Sachin flying back' was the headline on\nthe giant electronic bulletin board. Buses and cars screeched to a halt,\npeople stood and stared as if they could not believe their eyes. Salvation\nfor the beleaguered Indians was on its way.\n'It was my mother who prompted me to go and attend the nation's\ncall. She said even my father would have liked me to go and do my\nduty,' Tendulkar told reporters at Heathrow airport on his arrival back\nin England, the morning before the crucial game against Kenya. 'I\nrealize this match is important and we are keen to make a winning\nimpression. We have to win all three matches and keep the hopes of\nour supporters high. It's not going to be easy to put behind the tragedy\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fand concentrate on the job at hand.'\nTendulkar added, 'The entire country wanted me to play. The\nWorld Cup is very important to India. I therefore completed all\nformalities and took the first available flight to be here with the team.'\nGaekwad marvelled at Sachin's composure, and said he had no words\nto describe his star player's gesture. 'We will do everything to keep\nSachin's mind occupied. In any case, he is a restless person.'\n'I thought he might make it for the match against Sri Lanka on \nMay. Even in this hour of griefSachin could not resist coming to the\nrescue of the team which, as has been proved, cannot do without this\nman.'\nTen days into the World Cup, the first century of the tournament\nwas recorded. And it was scored by a man who had attended his father's\nfuneral just a few days earlier. What more monumental tribute can\nthere be to his skills, discipline and mental strength?\nIndia won by  runs to breathe fresh life into its campaign to\nreach the next stage. A full house at Bristol () gave Tendulkar\nthree standing ovations-first when he walked to the crease, then\nwhen he reached his twenty-second century, and finally when he\nwalked off with fellow centurion Rahul Dravid at the end oflndia's\ninnings of  for -Tendulkar on  and Dravid on . The\nunbroken stand of in  overs was the highest ever in the World\nCup (until India's next match against Sri Lanka). Sachin's previous\nODI centuries had all come when he was opening. This time he came\nin after Ramesh, for after the young man's half-century against\nZimbabwe, it had been decided to retain him as Ganguly's opening\npartner. Sachin's first  came in  balls; the second took . A look\nheavenwards in silent tribute to his father marked the completion of\nthe . 'I just looked up. It's very difficult to explain what I felt.' The\nlast ball of the innings was flicked disdainfully over midwicket for six,\njust as Viv Richards had done in the  World Cup final.\nThe century was dedicated to his father. Choking with emotion at\nthe post-match awards ceremony-even Tony Greig appeared\novercome when interviewing him-he said he had been motivated\nby his mother's words when he reached Mumbai for the funeral. 'The\nTradgedy and Tears\n\n\n\n\ffirst question my mother asked me was why did I come back. She said\neven your father would have wanted you to stay on. I had gone home\nbecause I was committed to my family. Similarly, I also have\ncommitment towards my country and countrymen.' He admitted it\nhad not been his best . 'But under the circumstances it was special.'\nPrime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee sent a congratulatory fax to\nthe Man of the Match. 'Not only did you not let the deep personal loss\ncaused by your father's sudden demise deter you but you actually\nused it as an inspiration to scale another summit in cricketing\nexcellence. The whole oflndia is proud of you.'\nLess than three years later, another tragedy would cast its shadow\nover Tendulkar's life.\nIndia won their next two matches against Sri Lanka and England to\nmake it to the Super. Six. They were joined by Zimbabwe and South\nAfrica from Group A and Australia, Pakistan and New Zealand from\nGroup B. Australia simply blew away India in the first match in the\nSuper Stage game. The big breakthrough came when Glenn McGrath\nhad Tendulkar caught behind for his first duck in  innings, with\njust one run on the board. His three previous innings against Australia\nhad produced centuries. Australia had, in its innings, piled up  for\n. No team had scored  to win an ODI in England and now, with his\nfirst four overs, McGrath had ensured it would not happen at the\nOval either. India were staggering at  for  and were all out for .\nThe team's chances of qualifYing for the semi-finals were now all but\ndead. But their next match against Pakistan took on an extra edge.\nThe conflict in Kargil was still raging back home and the Old\nTrafford authorities were concerned over a flare-up between rival\nspectators. The flare-up never happened, and India won a tense match\nby  runs. It was the third time India and Pakistan had met in the\nWorld Cup and each time India had come out on top. Tendulkar was\nback in the opener's slot and blazed briefly for . Despite the win,\nIndia were playing only for pride in their final match against New\nZealand, who had to win to reach the last four -which is exactly what\nthey did. Australia went on to win the World Cup for the second time,\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fbeating Pakistan in a lopsided final.\nThe Indian campaign had started and ended with a whimper. In\nbetween, there were some wonderful moments, notably Tendulkar's\ncentury against Kenya and the victories over England and Pakistan.\nBut overall, the cricket was disappointing and lacked consistency, as\nalways. All the pre-tournament hysteria had rapidly fizzled out.\nTendulkar's form too was patchy. He had  runs at .. But under\nthe circumstances, it was a huge credit to him that he made it back at\nall after the loss of his father.\n\nTradgedy and Tears\n\n\n Double-Then Trouble\n\nI always wanted this double very badly.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nBy October , Sachin Tendulkar was back in the team after his\nenforced break. His first Test series was at home against New Zealand,\na relatively soft start to his second innings as captain-or should one\nsay, follow-on? Tendulkar was joined by a new coach, Kapil Dev, who\nhad taken over from Anshuman Gaekwad. Kapil Dev had been with\nTendulkar in his debut series, in Pakistan in , and the two were\nknown to be close. It was hoped this would open a new chapter in\nIndian cricket and that the dynamic Kapil could transfer his magic as\na player to his new role as coach. Their first day in office was, however,\nanything but pleasant.\nOn a slightly damp pitch at Mohali, Stephen Fleming won the\ntoss, put India into bat and shot them out for a shocking  in a mere\n overs. Tendulkar ( ) was one of only three batsmen to reach double\nfigures. New Zealand's lead was . But that was wiped offby new\nopeners Devang Gandhi and S.Ramesh in the second innings. This\ntime, the top five all crossed  and two reached double figuresRahul Dravid and the captain himself At times, it appeared Tendulkar\nwas batting from memory. Indeed, he survived a vociferous appeal for\nlbw from the very first ball from Nathan Astle, which was turned\ndown by Sri Lankan umpire Peter Manuel. Eventually, India declared\nat  for -the first time that a side dismissed for under  in their\nfirst innings had crossed  in the second. Tendulkar's twentieth\ncentury was a sketchy one, perhaps due to lack ofbatting practice. He\nstayed at the crease for more than six and a half hours and got the\n\n\fbenefit of numerous lbw appeals.\nIt took a stubborn  by captain Stephen Fleming in the second\ninnings to stave off defeat as the visitors struggled to  for . But an\nIndian victory was duly delivered by the spin bowlers in the next Test\nat Kanpur. India coasted to victory by eight wickets, with the captain\nhimself rattling off  not out, from  balls, in the second innings of\n for.\nThe third and final Test at Ahmedabad should have been a triumph\nfor both Tendulkar and the team. Instead, after scoring his first Test\ndouble century in a decade, Tendulkar courted controversy by his\nrefusal to enforce a follow-on after leading by  runs. The match\npetered out into a draw and India took the series -. The question of\nwhy the follow-on was not enforced was later taken up by the CBI in\ntheir investigation into match-fixing and corruption in Indian cricket.\nThe coach and captain would eventually be exonerated of all\nwrongdoing late in .\nSachin had recorded his first double century in first-class cricket\nin , for Mumbai against the touring Australians. It had taken\nhim five years to score his maiden om century and now, after ten\nyears, came his first double ton in an international Test. The New\nZealand attack may not have been the most potent in international\ncricket. But, after all the pain and trauma resulting from his back\ninjury, it was indeed a sweet way to announce to the world of cricket\nthat he was back at his best.\nIndia were  for  on the first day at Ahmedabad, with S.Ramesh\nout for and Tendulkar batting on . He had earlier been dropped\nat short third man by Astle on . Fleming had said then that his team\nmight pay a price for the lapse and that is precisely what happened.\nThe runs continued to pile up and Ganguly joined in the fun with\n. The  stand with Tendulkar for the fourth wicket was an Indian\nrecord and the team declared at  for .\nThere had been talk earlier that Tendulkar had neither the stamina\nnor the application to convert his bagful of Test tons into. double\ncenturies. Now he answered his critics with his longest innings yet:\n minutes in all, during which he scored  from  balls. It was\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fanother psychological breakthrough, overtaking his previous highest\nof against the West Indies at Nagpur in . The  was reached\nwhen he placed Vettori to mid-on for a single. Non-striker Ajay Jadeja\nraced back to congratulate his captain. Sachin looked heavenwards in\nthanks. The Matera Stadium was once again witness to a milestone.\nThis was the same ground where Sunil Gavaskar became the first to\nreach , runs and where Kapil Dev broke Sir Richard Hadlee's\nworld Test wicket record. Sachin dedicated the double ton to his brother\nAjit: 'He has been there for me for the past  years of international\ncricket.' He said it was only when he crossed  that the thought of\nthe  entered his mind. 'I always wanted this double very badly.'\nSunil Gavaskar's Indian record of not out was in sight when\nTendulkar was dismissed by a brilliant catch, shortly after tea on the\nsecond day. It was a full-blooded pull offleft-arm spinner Daniel Vettori\nwhich was held inches off the ground at midwicket by Nash. The\nbatsman lingered and waited for the umpire's decision as he was not\nsure the ball had carried to the fielder.\nSadly, the sheen of achievement soon wore off. New Zealand were\ndismissed for . But India batted again in the second innings, finally\ndeclaring on  for . Set  to win in a possible  overs, New\nZealand had no trouble saving the Test and finished on  for . So\nwhy was the follow-on not enforced? The explanation of the captain\nand the coach was that the four specialist bowlers wanted a rest after\ntoiling in the blazing heat for nearly ten hours in New Zealand's first\nmnmgs.\nNot everyone was convinced. 'No captain of an international team\nwanting to win a Test convincingly would have wished away such a\nfine chance,' wrote G. Viswanath in the Hindu ( November ).\nRavi Shastri, one ofTendulkar's close friends and business associates,\nadmitted he was 'befuddled' by the tactics. Former New Zealand captain\nMartin Crowe was more scathing in his column in Rediff.com (\nNovember ): 'The last thing Test cricket needs is this approach\nby the Indian captain Sachin Tendulkar. It was a disgrace that the\ntactical attitude to dismiss the opposition was not as positive as that of\nthe batting.' The delayed declaration in the second innings was also\nDoubl~Then\n\nTrouble\n\n\n\n\fcondemned. 'It really shocked me that Tendulkar appeared to have to\nbe cajoled by Kapil Dev before he did finally declare.' Inexplicably,\none of the bowlers who had apparently demanded a break, Javagal\nSrinath (who bowled  overs in the first innings) came out to bat in\nthe second innings and hung around for nearly half an hour to score\n not out. Both he and the other not-out batsman, Jadeja, were\nconstantly looking in the direction of the pavilion for the captain to\ncall them in.\nHe did, eventually, after the second innings had consumed  overs,\nleaving the Indians with only  overs to have a go at their opponents\non the fourth evening. He justified his strategy in an interview with\nVijay Lokapally (Spottstar,  November ):\nJust spare a thought for the bowlers. They were tired. In the\nplaying XI, we had a couple of players with health problems.\nThere were a couple of others who also carried on despite some\nhealth problems ... .It was extremely hot that day ( degrees)\nand they had bowled about  overs. Asking them to bowl\nanother  at that stage would have meant someone might\nhave had a breakdown. We didn't want that kind of situation\nand that is why we gave the bowlers a break. They tried their\nbest I would say.\nTendulkar finished the series with a -plus average and got\nanother chance to gorge himself on the mediocre Kiwi attack in the\none-day series that followed. It was a high-scoring series and India\nwere run close. They sealed a - verdict by winning the final game in\nNew Delhi by seven wickets. It was a pretty mixed bag for the skipper.\nIn the second match at Hyderabad, he recorded the highest score by\nan Indian in oms and the fourth highest of all time, . But in the\nother four matches he had scores of, ,  and .\nNew Zealand had thrashed the Indian bowlers  for  in the first\nmatch at Rajkot-the highest  total on Indian soil. That record\nlasted just three days. India's  for  was the sewnd highest ODI total\nof all time and the stand of  for the second wicket in  overs\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fbetween Rahul Dravid and Tendulkar was the biggest ever partnership.\nGanguly missed out on the run riot when bowler Shayne O'Connor\ndeflected Tendulkar's firm push on to the non-striker's stumps, with\nthe batsman out of his ground, in the second over. Tendulkar carried\nhis bat, in the process erasing Ganguly's previous Indian highest of\n against Sri Lanka in the  World Cup. There were  fours\nand three sixes from the  balls he faced. He was on  when Chris\nCairns bowled the last over and there was a huge buzz around the\nground. Could he score the  needed to surpass Saeed Anwar's world\nrecord? It was notto be, though the Indian record was his.\nThe innings was marked by a number of innovative shots behind\nsquare leg. Sachin agreed after the innings that his shot selection had\nchanged. 'Your style ofbatting should not become too predictable and\nshould not be based on some set pattern,' he explained. 'This change\nin shot selection has come gradually as far as I am concerned .... The\n was satisfying not because I set an individual mark. It was satisfying\nbecause we won the match. Tomorrow, someone may break the record\nbut people would remember me for the contribution I made in\nwinning the match for India.' (Sportstar,  November )\nThe New Zealanders had acquitted themselves admirably. They\nlost the three-Test series narrowly, -, and the five-match  series\n-.\nFor Tendulkar and his men, the real test was round the corner in\nAustralia, where the world Test and ODI champions were waiting.\n\nDouble-Then Trouble\n\n\n Reluctant Messiah\n\nIf Sachin says no, he will be making a big mistake.-Ajit Wadekar\n\\.lways bat first, Azhar, always bat first,' was Bishan Singh Bedi's\nanguished cry as he watched, on television, the Indian captain put\nAustralia in at the start oflndia's first Super Six match on  June. Just\nas it had happened three years earlier, at Kolkata in the Wills World\nCup semi-final, this time too the move backfired. With the huge defeat\nthat followed, India's hopes of making it to the semi-finals were\nvirtually dashed. And so were Azharuddin's hopes of holding on to\nthe captaincy. The fact that he stayed on in England for surgery on his\nshoulder made the decision of the selectors somewhat easier when\nthey met in Nagpur on  July to announce Azhar's successor.\nNothing is what it seems in Indian cricket. There is always a story\nbehind the story, and more so when it concerns the never-ending soap\nopera that is the captaincy of the Indian cricket team. And so it transpired\nthis time too, as the committee consisting of chairman Ajit Wadekar,\nMadan Lal, Shivlav Yadav, Ani I Deshpande and Ashok Malhotra, with\nHcct Secretary J.Y.Lele in attendance, took all of 'two minutes'\n(Wadelear's words) to hand the mantle to Sachin Tendulkar once again,\nas they had done three years earlier. This, after taking more than an\nhour to trace BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur to get his telephonic\nconsent.\n'Only one name, that ofSachin, figured during the meeting and\nno other name came up for discussion,' according to the chairman.\n'He is the best player in the team, is a thinker and has good rapport\nwith his colleagues.' Then came the crucial question at the press\n\n\fconference, directed at Wadekar. Had Tendulkar's consent been taken\nby the Board? 'Not yet. But ifSachin says no (to the captaincy) he will\nbe making a mistake. He has not written to the Board for not being\nchosen as captain.'\n'Let's see ifhe refuses,' was what another selector was reported to\nhave said. The day before the meeting, a number of papers had carried\nreports stating Tendulkar had informed the selectors he did not want\nto lead again. Consequently, Ajay J adeja was considered a shoo-in for\nthe post. 'Tendulkar Not Inclined to Lead India' was the headline in\nthe Hindu ( July). In a Chennai date-lined report, G. Viswanath\nwrote: ' ... the little champion has decided to keep himself clear off the\nhot seat for reasons best known to him and certain people in the BCCJ.;\nIn the circumstances the selectors are not likely to look beyond Ajay\nJadeja ... .'\nOn the day of the announcement, however, the plot thickened\nfurther. It seemed every sports journalist and cricket official in the\ncountry was trying to track down the new appointee. This was cloakand-dagger stuff, Indian cricket style. There was one problem-no\none had a clue as to where he was. And those who did, were tightlipped. As Alice said in Alice in rMmderland, things were getting\n'curiouser and curiouser'. Lele, Indian cricket's very own Mad Hatter,\nwas in the thick of things. 'The telephone answering machine at\nSachin's residence in Mumbai recorded the message of his\nappointment as he was away,' he told a PTI reporter in Nagpur.\nHe was indeed 'away'. But where? And why had he made himself\nincommunicado for over  hours? The air was full of theories and\nspeculation. Was he in the family holiday home in the hill resort of\nLonavala, not far from Mumbai? Was he in Bangalore? Or was he\nseeking the blessings and advice of his spiritual guru, Satya Sai Baba,\nat Puttaparti in Andhra Pradesh? Only family and close friends knew\nfor sure. And no one was willing to come out with the facts.\nStill, after lying low and keeping the country in suspense-will\nhe, won't he?-the reluctant Messiah finally surfaced in Mumbai on\n July, and announced he would be holding a press conference the\nnext day to give his version of the dramatic events. Raj Singh conveyed\nReluctant Messiah\n\n\n\n\fthe news to an anxious nation that Tendulkar had indeed accepted the\nappointment. By now, it was also revealed that the Board had earlier\ntried to persuade him to take up the captaincy, but he had refused.\nFinally, it had been presented to him as a virtual fait accompli.\nEven by the normally chaotic standards ofcricket press conferences,\nthe one addressed by the new nominee at the Cricket Club oflndia in\nMumbai on Julywas pandemonium personified. I twas a good ten\nminutes before Tendulkar could speak, as dozens of photographers\nand TV cameramen jostled for vantage positions.\nSachin disclosed that he had learnt about his appointment from\nthe messages left on his answering machine, from phone calls and\nwatching the news. 'Two days before the selection committee meeting,\nI told Mr Raj Singh, Mr Lele and Mr Wadekar, that I was not mentally\nprepared (to be made captain),' he said. 'I was not mentally prepared to\ntake up the captaincy as it is the practice for the vice-captain to be\nnamed the next captain. I was not the vice-captain of the team since\nlosing the captaincy [in January ].' He stressed four points: that\nhe was proud to lead the country again and that it was an honour; that\nhe had no problem with Azharuddin being in the team; that he would\nwant more say in selection matters; and that he would open the batting\nin ODIS.\nNot everyone was convinced. G .Rajaraman of the Hindustan Times\n( July ) asked in the headline: 'Is Azhar's Slot the Contentious\nIssue?'\nEven if it is the last thing we wanted, we will have to contend\nwith the image of a reluctant and sulking leader, too. Sadly, it\nwill stick for some time ... .If he cannot face pressure at the\nappointment, can he stand it when the heat is on?\nThere seemed little doubt, though, that at the back of Sachin's\nmind was the bitter memory of how he had been let down by the\nselectors and some teammates during his first tenure including Azhar,\nwhom he would later name when questioned by the CBI. As the October\n Report on Cricket Match-Fixing and Related Malpractices says on\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fpage : 'On being asked whether he suspected any Indian player of\nbeing involved in match-fixing, Sachin stated that during his tenure\nas Captain, he had telt that Mohd. Azharuddin was not putting in\n% effort and he suspected that he was involved with some bookies.'\nTo get to the bottom of the mystery, I asked Wadekar to write down\nhis views on the incident. He had earlier in a column stated that it was\na mistake to appoint Sachin the second time round, against his wishes.\nThis is what Wadekar wrote in a letter to me dated  October :\nIn  it was clear that Azhar couldn't have been made captain\nas he was not in form. We tried Ani! Kumble but he did not\nmeasure up to the requirements of the captain nor did he look\nvery aggressive. We wanted Sourav Ganguly to lead instead\nbut Mr Raj Singh, then president of the Board, interfered with\nour selection and told us point-blank in the selection committee\nmeeting held at Kolkata (sic) that Sourav was a selfish person\nand wasn't liked by some of the players. Since he wouldn't\nhave ratified our decision as president, it was senseless to appoint\nhim as captain. Yes, Mr Raj Singh has a habit of dabbling in the\nselections all the time.\nSince there was nobody to take the reins of the captaincy,\nincluding reluctant Sachin, I thought I would persuade him to\nbe the captain. I went to his home for this purpose. He was\nplaying table tennis. He came up to his flat to meet me. When\nI opened the topic about the captaincy, he did not oppose it\nvehemently but he also did not show any joy on the matter and\nwas rather hesitant to accept it or not.\nWhat he did not realize was that I wanted him to lead the\nIndian team for as long as he wanted to. I wanted him to be\nanother Sir Donald Bradman who was not only a legend in\nbatting all over the world but also a great captain ... .It was\nunfortunate that when he was appointed as a captain, he did\nnot come out with the acceptance for nearly three days. In fact,\nhe was not traceable at all ....\nWhat this meant was that Tendulkar was certainly not the only\nReluctant Messiah\n\n\n\n\fname in contention. And the selection meeting certainly took more\nthan two minutes to decide! Tendulkar himself confirmed the meeting\nwith Wadekar (though with a different perspective) in an interview to\nCrilket Talk: 'Yes, I did not want it [the captaincy]. When Ajit Wadekar\ncame to my house at the start of the season last year [i.e., ], I told\nhim that I was not interested in the job. He was supposed to inform\nthe other selectors but I don't know what happened and I was asked to\nlead ... .'( March ). Later, Wadekarwrote these words in a specially\ncommissioned article for the  Sachin birthday special for the\nlndya.com website where I was sports editor:\nIt was really foolish on my part as chairman of the selection\ncommittee to force him to accept the captaincy. This despite\nthe fact that he was very reluctant when I spoke to him at his\nplace prior to the selection. He is not interested in the\ncaptaincy-he would prefer to relax by eating his favourite crabs\nat my place and then go out and smash the bowlers.\n\nQuestions remained, doubts lingered, about the captaincy\ncontroversy. But by late August, it was time for Tendulkar's first outing\nas captain in his second stint.\nThe Aiwa Cup in Sri Lanka pitted India against the hosts and\nAustralia. It turned out to be something of a misadventure for the\nIndians, who won just one of their four matches and failed to make it\nto the final. India's first match on  August saw them trounced by\neight wickets by the Aussies. Things hardly improved when they\nwent down by seven wickets to Sri Lanka in their next match. Four\nIndian batsmen were run out, including the 'new' captain for .\nThere was worse to come, however. On the morning of August,\nwhen India were to take on Australia again, the captain awoke with a\nstiff back and ruled himself out of the match. Ajay Jadeja led the side\nthat was beaten this time by  runs.\nTend ulkar returned for the final league match, the only one which\nIndia would win. It was a make-or-break situation for the side and he\nchose to ignore his troublesome back. The match was marked by his\n\n\nSachin\n\n\ftwenty-third century and though India won by  runs, they were\nedged out of a place in the final on the net run rate. The captain had\nendured tremendous pain to reach his century, but in vain. The\ndiscomfort he was in was obvious when he hoicked spinner Uppal\nChandana for six over long on, grimaced and clutched his back. Yet he\nsoldiered on. Team doctor Ravinder Chadha treated him on the field\nafter the fall of opener Ramesh's wicket.\nThere was much speculation in the media about the reasons for\nthe recurrence of his back problem. Doctors, surgeons, physios, explayers and journalists all had their say. The theories included excessive\ncricket, hot and humid conditions, the remarkably heavy bat\nTendulkar wielded, even the position of his feet while making certain\nstrokes. The general consensus was that the injury could curtail\nTendukar's career.\nNext stop for the team was the Singapore Challenge against\nZimbabwe and the West Indies. Tendulkar () picked up another\nMan of the Match award against Zimbabwe, and the win was enough\nto ensure that India would meet the West Indies in the final. Tendulkar\nrested himself the next day for the inconsequential league match\nagainst the twice former world champions, and Ganguly led for the\nfirst time. The first final was abandoned due to rain with India\nstruggling on  for  (Tendulkar: ). It was worse when the match\nwas replayed. Tendulkar was out without scoring, from the sixth ball\nof the match bowled by Courtney Walsh, who had taken his wicket in\nthe abandoned final, too. This time the batsman took a chance but\npaid the price as Hendy Bryan held the juggling catch at third man.\nIndia's  for  was easily overhauled.\nThe Kargil conflict between India and Pakistan meant the two\nteams would not meet in the annual Sahara Cup at Toronto. Instead,\nthe organizers arranged for two tournaments involving the West\nIndies-three matches each against India and Pakistan. The Indians\nand West Indians virtually flew across the planet and spent more than\na day travelling between Sri Lanka and Canada. But India was without\nthe services of their captain, who decided instead to fly to Adelaide to\nhave his back examined by Dr Peter Barnes, a specialist at the Australian\nReluctant Messiah\n\n\n\n\fCricket Academy.\nThe prognosis was troubling. According to Dr Barnes, 'I think it\nwould be a nuisance to him and probably restrict him. I guess in that\nsense it would probably limit his career... But he is such a great bat that\nhe can probably bat with one leg and still make runs.' He felt Tendulkar\nhad handled the problem pretty well for the last six months.\nDr Barnes said the Indian captain was suffering from spondylosis.\n'There is some bony defect on either side of the spine down in the\nbottom half of the back.' He told a press conference in Adelaide on \nSeptember that the problem had been there long before it first surfaced\nin Chennai in J,aJtuary, during the Test match against Pakistan. S~chin\nhad defects in the lower vertebrae and inflamed scar tissue had formed\nin the lower back region. It would be an estimated three to four weeks\nbefore he could return to cricket.\nOnce again, it was as if the entire nation had only one thing on its\nmind. As an irritated Sachin was to say (Sportstar,  February ):\nWhoever I met asked the same question, 'How is your back?'\nbefore they actually greeted me with a 'Hello'. It got to a point\nwhen it started affecting me. I did not feel like meeting anyone.\nI understood the feelings of the people but ifl have to hear it a\nthousand times, 'How is your back?' and I have to answer it, it's\nfrustrating. I am glad it's all over. It's part of any sportsperson's\nlife. After playing for  years these are things which are bound\nto happen. There is going to be wear and tear. The fact is that\nthe body has been used for so many years.\nThe break meant! Tendulkar missed not only the DMC Cup in\nToronto (India, led by Ganguly, beat the West Indies -), but also the\nLG Cup in Nairobi, where Ajay Jadeja was captain and India lost in the\nfinal to South Africa.\n\n\n\nSachin Foot Fault\n\nThere cannot be another Sachin Tendulkar.-Virender Sehwag\n\nAfter the excitement of the home series against Australia, it was time\nfor the Indians to hit the road again. First stop would be Zimbabwe,\nwhere they had not won a Test match in the two previous visits,\nfollowed by Sri Lanka and then South Africa. In , Zimbabwe's\ninaugural Test had been drawn; six years later, they had shocked India\nby  runs. Now it was time to make amends.\nThe Indians started on the right note. The first Test at Bulawayo\nwas won by the visitors by eight wickets, their first victory outside\nAsia since beating England - in . Sachin Tendulkar top-scored\nwith  in India's first innings of. However, opener Shiv Sundar\nDas was the Man of the Match with  and  not out. Tendulkar ()\nhit the winning runs. It was a special moment, for only twice before in\nhis career had India won abroad-in Colombo in  and in Dhaka\nin . He pulled out a stump as a souvenir-something he had\nnever done before. Asked why by a journalist, he replied: 'This is a\nspecial feeling.'\nIndeed it was. But it would not last for long. Harare had been the\nscene oflndia's shocking defeat in . Now the batting crumbled in\nboth innings. Totals of  and  were just not good enough.\nZimbabwe swept home by four wickets and India were once again\ndenied series victory on foreign soil. From an individual point-ofview, the one-day tri-series that followed (with the West Indies) was a\ntriumph for Tendulkar. With scores of, ,  not out,  not out\nand , he was the Man of the Series, bagging three Man of the Match\n\n\fawards as well. His century came in the last round-robin game against\nthe West Indies at Harare, on  July, after India had ensured that they\nwould be in the final. Needing  to win, Tendulkar stayed until the\nend (. overs) on , as India won by four wickets. But the duck in\nthe final against the same opponents, at the same venue, rankled.\nFacing a total of , India fell short by  runs. It was Tendulkar's\ndismissal at the hands of Man of the Match Corey Collymore that\nproved vital once again.\nIt was obvious Sachin was having fitness problems and while\nfielding, he had made numerous visits to the dressing room for\ntreatment. At the time, it was said that he had a stomach injury.\nBack home, an interview that Tendulkar gave to PTI reporter Ashish\nShukla was causing waves. In it, Sachin had discussed the sensitive\nissue of captaincy. Sensitive, because Sourav Ganguly's bad patch\nwith the bat was just beginning to be noticed and commented upon.\nIn the interview (published in newspapers around the country on \nJuly  ), Tendulkar was quoted as saying that he was not thinking\nabout leading the team 'at the moment. But I haven't ruled it out also.'\nHe then sought to dispel suggestions that the burden of captaincy had\nhampered his batting in the past and said his first double century\ncame when he was captain. 'Only, I think when I was captain, we\nplayed South Africa, West Indies and Australia ... probably the toughest\ntours,' he was quoted as saying. Shukla added: 'But he did admit that\ncaptaincy had hampered him \"as a person\" though he did not elaborate.'\nNaturally, all the headlines focussed on his comments on the\ncaptaincy, a never-ending debate in Indian cricket circles. Earlier, in\nDecember , he had been quoted on the issue for the first time by\na Bengali paper from Kolkata. 'When I gave up the captaincy, the\nsituation demanded so. However, I have never said that I will not lead\nIndia again. I am pretty open to the idea ofleading India if the situation\ncomes to such a stage.'\nWord quickly got back to Sachin that the interview was making\nnews. The result was damage control in the form of one ofhis longest\nnewspaper interviews to V Srivatsa in Harare, run over three parts in\nthe Times ofIndia (- July ).\nFoot Fault\n\n\n\n\fQ: Why this sudden speculation about captaincy and you not\nbeing averse to step in when you quit the job on your own even\nas everyone begged of you to stay on?\nA: I have never spoken on this issue. I was just asked whether\nI would be keen on leading the side and I said I have not really\nthought about it. I didn't step down from the captaincy so I can\nimmediately start thinking about it. I took some time to make\nthis decision, it's not a rash decision taken at the spur of the\nmoment. I just felt what I was doing was right and I just like to\nclose those chapters and enjoy the game.\nQ: There's nothing wrong in aspiring to be a captain, just as a\npolitician wanting to become the prime minister, but what were\nthe compelling reasons for quitting in the first place? Were\nthey cricketing reasons or personal?\nA: Even when I stepped down I said I wasn't ruling out\ncompletely another stint of captaincy at a later stage. Even now\nI say the same thing, that doesn't mean I want to become captain\ntoday. Things are going well and I don't want to disturb\nanything. The problem is whatever I say is interpreted. Ifl had\nsaid that I am not interested in captaincy it would have become\na headline, and ifl say no comments then people would have\nsaid something is cooking. I feel things are going in the right\ndirection and that's how it should be.\nApart from the sensitive subject of captaincy, there was news being\ncreated by Sunil Gavaskar too. In a rare critique of Tendulkar, he\ncame down on him for throwing away his wicket in the defeat in the\nsecond Test at Harare. Tendulkar on  had carved a widish delivery\nto point, to trigger another Indian batting collapse on the fourth day.\nThe team had slipped from  for  to , paving the way for\nZimbabwe's victory.\nGavaskar felt that the Australians were correct in rating their captain\nSteve Waugh as the best Test batsman in the world, for his ability to\nwin or save matches for his team on foreign soil. 'Why blame VVS.\nLaxman when the best batsman in the universe [Tendulkar] gets a\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fhalf-century and then gets out, when a big score from him is the\ncrying need of the team?' Gavaskar wrote in an Australian paper. The\ncriticism was challenged by veteran journalist Raju Bharatan in\nSporstar (July ), who made the point that Waugh had failed to\ncome through for his side when they were beaten - in that fantastic\nseries in India.\nThere was a more serious matter, though, for the great man and\nhis millions offollowers to wrestle with, shortly after the team returned\nfrom Zimbabwe. During the last league match against the West Indies\nat Harare on  July, when he scored his twenty-ninth ODI century,\nSachin had felt a sharp pain in his foot while setting offfor a single. A\nmonth later, he invited the press to his new home in Bandra (West) to\nexplain the injury and its implications.\nDuring the match [on  July], I felt pain while batting. I\nremember telling Rahul [Dravid] about feeling pain in the\nright toe. I heard a click while batting. Mter that click the toe\nbegan hurting. The next day's practice session I didn't do much\nexcept apply ice to the toe. I informed physio Andrew Lei pus. I\nwent to hospital for x-rays. Nothing showed in it. It was normal.\nWe also consulted a specialist who said as there was no fracture,\nI could play. But he said the injury would need rest afterwards.\nI started feeling pain and was waiting for it to settle down. When\nI came back to India I had - days ice treatment but it didn't go\ndown. I decided to go through a diagnosis. Dr Anant Joshi\nadvised a scan.\n\nMter a bone scan and CT scan were done in Mumbai, it was revealed\nthat there was a hairline fracture of the right big toe. The 'click' that\nTendulkar had heard was most likely of his tiny toe bone (known as\nthe 'medial sesamoid') snapping. Tendulkar felt there may have been\nmore pressure on the area due to the spike-studded sole ofhis custommade shoes. One of the seven spikes is located directly under the\nsesamoid bone of the big toe. The pressure exerted when taking off for\na run, up to three to five times the body weight, on one foot, could\nFoot Fault\n\n\n\n\fhave impacted and fractured the tiny bone.\nThe tour to Sri Lanka, consisting of a one-day tri-series followed\nby three Test matches, was round the corner. Initially, it was hoped\nTendulkar would miss only the oms and would be fit in time for the\nTest series. 'I don't mind missing the one-dayers, but please ensure I\ncan make it for the Test series,' he pleaded with Dr B.A. Krishna, chief\nof nuclear medicine at Hinduja Hospital, where the scans were carried\nout. Itwas not to be. On August, by which time the ODI series was\nover, he announced he would be pulling out of the Test series as the\nfracture had not healed completely. Six weeks' rest was recommended,\nso he would hopefully be fit in time for the tour to South Africa in\nSeptember.\n'Sachin could have played the Test series only at the risk offurther\ninjury. And even then he wouldn't have been able to give a hundred\nper cent,' explained Dr Joshi. For a few days, the whole country watched\nas Tendulkar's fractured toe and Prime Minister Vajpayee's worn out\nknee competed for space in the media.\nTendulkar had missed some one-day matches just before and after\nthe  World Cup due to back pain. But it was the first time since\nhis debut in Pakistan in November  that he was missing a Test\nmatch. By  August , when the first Test against Sri Lanka at\nGalle started without him, he had played a record  consecutive\nTests since his debut, stretching from Karachi in November  to\nHarare in June .\nEven as he was resting and undergoing treatment, Sachin received\na piece of good news from Australia. Writer Roland Perry revealed that\nshortly before his death in February, Sir Don had listed for him what\nhe considered his all-time greatest team. There was just one Indian\nand one contemporary player among the twelve named and that was\nTendulkar, one of Sir Don's favourites. The news delighted Sachin\neven as the Indian media went to town. 'It is a great honour. The\ngreatest thing to happen. It is important when Sir Don speaks anything\nand especially when he selects me in his team, there cannot be a better\nthing than that,' he said. 'I am very thrilled about it and very excited.\nThere are some great names missing and to see my namt in it, I am\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fmore than thrilled. Mter Sir Don and before Garry Sobers [in the\nbatting line-up ]-what else can you ask for?'\nThe Sri Lankan tour produced mixed results in Sachin's absence.\nIndia reached the final of the tri-series (New Zealand was the third\nteam), only to lose once again to the hosts. The Test series started with\nIndia losing the first Test at Galle, bouncing back to win the second at\nKandy, and then being beaten in the decider at Colombo.\nThere was a significant innings in the last league match in the ODI\nseries against New Zealand, at Colombo, that India had to win to\nreach the final. The young Delhi batsman Virender Sehwag was asked\nto open the innings after Yuvraj Singh and Arnay Khurasiya had failed\nin that position. He grabbed the opportunity with glee, smashing the\nsecond fastest century by an Indian in oms (from  balls).\nRemarkably similar in height, build and looks, Sehwag also\ndisplayed an array of attacking shots normally the preserve of\nTendulkar, whose batting spot he had taken in his hero's enforced\nabsence. Tendulkar thrilled Schwag by sending a message of\ncongratulations. And the press was quick to latch on to the similarity.\nThe 'New Tendulkar', they were already calling him. Sehwag, though,\nwould have none of it.\n'How can I be even compared with the great man! Look at the\namount of cricket he has played, and see what I have played in\ncomparison. Just see how many matches he's won for India. I mean,\nhe's God when he's out there in the middle. There cannot be another\nSachin Tcndulkar,' he told TapanJoshi ofCrU:ketnext.com.\n\nFoot Fault\n\n\n Year of Controversies\n\nLift without cricket is unthinkable for me.-Sachin Tendulkar\nThe latter half of was to see one controversy after another-not\nall of his own making--dogging Sachin Tendulkar's footsteps. First\nin Zimbabwe had come the interview where he claimed he had been\nmisquoted on the captaincy issue. There was even some\nunpleasantness over his fractured toe, with a section of the media\nclaiming the injury was not as serious as it was made out to be; and\nwas merely an excuse to not tour Sri Lanka. This angered both\nTendulkar and Dr Joshi, the BCCI doctor who he had been consulting\nafter his return from Zimbabwe. It was all quite unnecessary and\nmean-minded, really.\nAnother stortn blew in over which he had little control. Wisden\nCricket Monthly, which had been founded in  by David Frith, was\ngetting set to launch its Indian edition and also Wisden's Internet site,\nWisden.com. As part of the pre-launch hype, the publishers released at\na press conference in Mumbai on  July , their own version of\nthe top  Test batting and bowling performances of all time. This\nwas presented as the Wisden Online . Shockingly, none of\nTendulkar's  Test tons (until then) got into the list. The reaction in\nIndia was swift and sharp. 'OhJesus! The Cricketing Bible Excludes\nthe Great Indian God' screamed the banner headline in the New\nDelhi edition of the Indian Express ( July). The controversial aspect\nof the list got it tremendous space in the media, both in India and\nabroad.\nThe formula for deciding the rankings was explained by the man\n\n\fwho had invented the system, YAnanth Narayan, a virtual unknown\nin cricket circles.\nOne Wisden official airily dismissed the outraged response from\nthe journalists gathered at the function. 'Tendulkar needs to play more\ngreat innings in future to make the list,' he said. Not many in India or\nabroad were willing to buy that line. VVS. Laxman was the highest\nranked Indian on the list, at number six, for his stupendous  against\nAustralia at Kolkata earlier that year.\nIt emerged that the people behind the Wisden rankings had laid\ngreat store by whether the batsman's contribution had been a matchwinning one or not. This automatically shut out some of the great\nmatch-saving batting performances. Nirmal Shekhar in the Sportstar\n( August ) raised the pertinent point: 'Surely, you cannot\npenalize a genius [Tendulkar] for the mediocrity around him!'\nIn fact, two ofTendulkar's OOs against Australia, both at Chennai,\nhad been instrumental in earning India a victory. So also his century\nat Colombo in . His  not out in  had been ruled out by\nWisdm as the bowling was not considered to be of top quality-Shane\nWarne, Gavin Robertson and Paul Reiffel being the front line bowlers!\nEven more baffling was the exclusion ofhis  at Chennai in March\n that had helped India clinch the epic series -. The front line\nbowlers this time were Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie, Colin Miller\nand Warne. Any attack with McGrath and Warne can safely be\nconsidered world-class. But the number-crunchers at Wisden were\nunmoved.\nIn all the heat and dust raised by the rankings, there was one\nimportant factor that was obscured. Wisden Online was not 'the Bible of\ncricket'. That tag belongs to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, which is the\nlongest running sports yearbook, having appeared continuously since\n. The launch ofWisden Cricket Asia magazine in December \nand the Wisden.com web site earlier the same year had sought to cash in\non the aura surrounding one of the most revered names in sport. But\napart from being part of the same publishing house, they bear little\nresemblance to theAlmanack as far as reliability, tradition and longevity\nare concerned.\n\n\fNot only did Tendulkar not find a place in the top  of all time,\nbut he also did not make it to the Indian Top Ten. This is where the\nmatter took on farcical overtones. For, coming in at number ten was\nAjit Wadekar's  in the third Test against New Zealand at Wellington\nin .\nRaju Bharatan, who attacked the logic (or the lack of it) behind the\nrankings both in the Hindu and its sister publication, the Spottstar, had\nthis to say in the daily ( August  ):\nCommendable as was that  knock by way of being Ajit\nWadekar's only Test hundred, pray how did it 'set up India's\nfirst overseas series win'? For Wadekar's , being in the third\nTest v New Zealand at Basin Reserve (Wellington) during\nMarch , only saw the Junior Nawab ofPataudi's India go\nup - in that four-match series. Short point: 'India's first\noverseas series win' was thus yet to happen after that third Test\nin which Wadekar hit . Actually, only as a result of our run victory in the fourth and final Test at Eden Park (Auckland)\ndid India register its 'first overseas series win'. And, in that\ndeciding fourth Test, Ajit scored just  and  (as we clinched\nthe rubber -), so the renewed query-how did Wadekar's\n'excellent innings set up India's first overseas series win'? It was\nmainly thanks to Erapalli Prasanna's match analysis of .-- and Bishan Singh Bedi's match figures of.- - (on top ofFarokh Engineer's , Rusi Surti's  and Chandu\nBorde's  not out) that we won that fourth determinant Test\nwith Ajit Wadekar nowhere in the picture.\nIn February , the list of top  One-day International batting\nand bowling performances was announced. This time the media paid\nless attention than the year before. There were only fom centuries out\nofSachin's career  (at that stage) in the list, with the highest coming\nin at number . (His bowling figures of for  against Australia at\nKochi in  came in at number ).\nThis time the match-winning argument was invalid-a\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fphenomenal  of those centuries had helped India win. Missing\nfrom the list was his  against Australia at Sharjah in  (the socalled 'sandstorm innings') which got India into the final despite losing\nthe game. The reasons trotted out by Ananth Narayan for its exclusion\nonly exposed the hollowness of the system.\nWe were told the match did not result in a win for India, thus\nignoring the fact that the first target had been to get past New Zealand's\nnet run rate and into the final. And that the sandstorm which\ninterrupted Sachin's innings and altered the target, was of no\nconsideration as factors beyond the scorecard itself were not taken\nnote of. In other words, any schoolboy could have come up with his\nown ranking. Merely attaching the Wisden tag gave it no special\nsanctity.\nInterestingly, one of Wrsden's own columnists, Kamran Abbasi,\nnow came out with criticism of the Test listing, saying the absence of\nany innings from Tendulkar and Javed Miandad had not been\nadequately explained.\nBarely a month after the Wrsden Online Test , came the revelation\nofSir Don Bradman's 'Dream Team'. Of course, like any 'World XI'\nselection, this one too evoked controversy. That it had been chosen by\ncricket's greatest legend only added to the debate. It was to avoid all\nthis that Bradman had stipulated that author Roland Perry release the\ntwelve names only after his death. There were certainly some\nsurprising names on the list. It was heavily biased towards Australians\n(seven out of , including Bradman) and the structure of the team\nlooked unbalanced. While the team was heavily criticized (Sunil\nGavaskar expressed his doubts as to whether Bradman himself had\nmade the selection), there was little dispute over Tendulkar's inclusion\nin the side.\nIn the chapter on Tendulkar in Perry's bookBradman's Best, Perry\nemphasized Sir Don's fascination with Tendulkar's batting. 'Rradman\nnever missed a chance to see Tendulkar from then [when he first saw\nand commented on his batting] until the end of the  three-match\nTest series in Australia,' wrote Perry. Perry adds that by mid-, after\nwatching Tendulkar destroy Australia in Tests and one-day games in\nYear of Controversies\n\n\n\n\fIndia, Bradman ranked him with Barry Richards, Arthur Morris and\nGarry Sobers. 'Not long after that series against Australia, Tendulkar\nreceived the invitation of a lifetime to join Shane Warne in meeting\nBradman at his Kensington Park home in Adelaide on his th birthday.\nTendulkar was honoured to be told by Bradman that he was today's\nbest batsman.'\nMter the meeting Brad man told Perry how impressed he was with\nTendulkar and how he expected him to go on to even greater\nachievements. 'Both players had mutual friendship and respect for\neach other. Bradman had great respect for the character ofTendulkar.'\nMuch to everyone's relief, Tendulkar was fit for the tour to South\nMrica where India were to play three Tests and a one-day tri-series\nwith Kenya. The short break from cricket had obviously weighed on\nSachin's mind. He watched all the matches on TV and was clearly\nfrustrated at not being an active part of it all. But the break did give\nhim precious time with his family.\n'How was life without cricket for two months?' he was asked by\nVijay Lokapally (Sportstar,  September ).\nA: It's been tough. Life without cricket is unthinkable for me,\nbut then the injury left me with no option. I was forced to stay\naway from cricket and thankfully the return has been as early\nas possible.\nQ: Wasn't it a frustrating period?\nA: No doubt. It was very, very tough and very frustrating too.\nBut then it was not that I wasn't in touch with cricket. I watched\nthe team play and I shared their joy and disappointments in\nvictories and defeats.\nQ: How would you describe the feeling on missing your first\nTest series since your debut in ?\nA: It was a very unusual situation for me. I am not at all used to\nsitting at home when cricket is on.\nQ: Your reflections after the return from Zimbabwe?\nA: I was able to focus on a few things away from cricket even\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthough it was a painful experience, but the greatest joy came\nout of the period as I could spend a lot of time with my family.\nIt was a bonus actually for me and my family. I may have missed\ncricket but the gain on the home front was priceless. Looking\nafter my wife and kids and their company made my recovery\nevery bit easy. Honestly it was great to be in the company of\nAnjali, Sara and Arjun.\nThe rest certainly recharged his batteries. He was in peak form in\nthe tri-series where he notched up his thirtieth and thirty-first ODI\ncenturies. Tendulkar and Ganguly had two century opening stands\nand in the process rewrote two records set by the great West Indian\nopening pair of Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes. Their stand\nofH in the last league match against Kenya at Paarl rewrote their\nown previous world record of against Sri Lanka in . The run stand was their sixteenth partnership of over , surpassing the\nmark of  held by the West Indians. In the same tournament,\nGreenidge and Haynes' total of  runs in partnership was also\neclipsed.\nThe opening match against South Africa at Johannesburg on \nOctober saw both the Indian openers record centuries in a stand worth\n. It was Tendulkar's first international match in three months and\nhe celebrated his return with . Yet, India were beaten by six wickets.\nThere was another century stand against South Africa at East London,\nthough once again it was in a losing effort. Kenya shocked the Indians\nby  runs in Port Elizabeth and so, not for the first time in a\ntournament, it became a must-win situation for them in their final\nleague match. This time, Ganguly and Tendulkar ensureJ there would\nbe no escape route for Kenya, with their world-record partnership.\nThe Indians were looking to their openers for another good start\nin the final against South Africa at Durban. But their twin failures\nspelt doom for the side. They were beaten by six wickets. It was the\nninth final in a row that the Indians had lost and questions were now\nbeing asked about Tendulkar's form in crunch games. These were his\nscores in the finals (he missed four games between  and  due\nYear of Controversies\n\n\n\n\fto injuries): Tri-series v South Mrica at Durban: ; Coca-Cola Cup\nv West Indies at Harare: ; Coca-Cola Cup v Sri Lanka at Sharjah: ;\nrcc Knock-out v New Zealand at Nairobi: ; Singapore Challenge\nv West Indies at Singapore: . Ninety-one runs in five innings were\nrather poor returns. There were other centuries, though, under adverse\ncircumstances, such as the two in the  World Cup; the one in\n against Kenya, days after his father's death; and two against\nAustralia at Sharjah in . In addition, he had been there with runs\nin crunch situations, when India desperately needed to win their final\nleague matches or increase their net run rate in order to reach the\nfinals.\nIndia had not won a Test match on two previous tours to South\nMrica, in  and - and they did not look like they were about\nto change that scenario in  either. The old weaknesses on pitches\noutside the Asian subcontinent would once again be cruelly exposed\non the very first day of the series at Bloemfontein.  Indian wickets\nwere down for , with the South Mrican pace attack on the rampage.\nSachin 'lendulkar was now joined by Virender Sehwag who was\nplaying his first Test; they were the last recognized batting pair at the\ncrease. One more wicket down and the tail would be exposed. There\nfollowed a savage counter-attack from Tendulkar and the 'new\nTendulkar'. Sehwag, from the small town ofNajafgarh outside Delhi,\nhad made a huge impact in the one-day series in Sri Lanka. But dubbed\na one-day specialist, he had not been retained for the Test series that\nfollowed. For this Test too, he had been a marginal selection.\nNow, in the presence of his batting idol, he took the South Mrican\nbowling attack apart in a stand worth  glorious runs. Tendulkar\ntook  balls to score his first run; the next  came from  as he\nunleashed a range of savage shots, including one he had rarely used,\nthe slash over the slips. India finished the opening day at  for ,\nTendulkar out for  and Sehwag ( )-now dubbed the 'NaJafgarh\nSachin' -becoming the eleventh Indian to score a century on Test\ndebut. At the end of the day's play, Tendulkar refused to rate his twentysixth Test century, saying 'a hundred is a hundred and each has his\nown place.' He was determined not to allow his own ton to obscure\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fSehwag's feat. 'He has shown everything which a batsman should\nhave-patience, technique and strokes,' he said, hastening to add, 'but\nI don't want to comment too much about him as there's a lot more to\ncome in the future. We can't judge him on just one innings.' That was\nseen as Tendulkar's way oflessening the pressure on his -year-old\nteammate.\nWhen Sehwagjoined him at the crease, Tendukar's words to the\ndebutant had put him at ease. 'I know you must be tense. Even I was\nwhen I made my debut. But don'tworry too much, just enjoy yourself'\n'I didn't copy Sachin, I learnt from him when I was young,' said\nSehwag on television.\nIndian coach John Wright was clear in his assessment ofTendulkar' s\nton. With his cricketing experience stretching over  years, he said it\nwas the best Test innings he had ever seen. Tendulkar and Sehwag in\ntheir first big stand together made onlookers rub their eyes in\nbewilderment. Who was who? Pradeep Magazine was quick to point\nthis out in the Hindustan Times ( November ): 'He [Sehwag]\nhas something more as well: strokes which remind everyone of\nTendulkar. There were moments yesterday when it became difficult\nto differentiate between the two. Some of the shots he played bore the\nmaestro's stamp.'\nThe impressive innings ofled Wisden.com India editor Sambit\nBal to rank it third after Sachin's  century at Perth and the \nChennai tun against Pakistan. Ironically, all three failed to prevent\ndefeat for India. Bal was writing on the third day of the Test, by which\ntime the writing was already on the wall for the Indians despite the\nheroic effort of the first day. It led him to lament in Wtsden Online (\nNovember ): 'No prizes for guessing that it won't come within\nsniffing distance of the Wisden  iflndia lose. Pity.' Sure enough,\ndespite scoring a healthy  in the first innings, India capitulated by\nnine wickets in four days.\n'Tendulkar has to perform more consistently on bouncy wickets\nin South Mrica and Australia to lay claim to be the best batsrran in the\nworld along with Brian Lara,' South Mrican legend Barry Richards\nhad said a couple of months earlier, labelling him 'a good batsman\nYear of Controversies\n\n\n\n\fonly at home'. This was Tendulkar's answer to Richards, if one was\nneeded. It was his third century on South Mrican soil (in his eighth\nTest there) to go along with his three in Australia, also in eight Tests.\nDefeat in four days was bad enough. But even worse was lurking\nround the corner for the tourists. Their bogeyman this time wasn't a\nSouth Mrican cricketer, it was match referee Mike Denness, the former\nEngland captain. India were battling to save the second Test at Port\nElizabeth after conceding a first-innings lead of  runs when the\nworld of cricket was hit by a bombshell delivered by Denness on the\nfourth evening of the match.\nSix players-captain Sourav Ganguly, Deep Dasgnpta, Shiv\nSundar Das, Harbhajan Singh, Virender Sehwag and Sachin\nTendulkar-were slapped with sentences of varying degrees. The bulk\nof these came for what the match referee perceived as excessive and\nintimidatory appealing and showing dissent at the umpires' decisions.\nGanguly was hauled up for not being in control of his team. Suspended\nsentences and fines were handed out. Sehwag, playing in only his\nsecond Test match, was banned for the next and fined  per cent of his\nmatch fee.\nMost shocking was the charge against Tendulkar. Denness claimed\nTendulkar, during his bowling spell, had tampered with the ball on\nthe third day. In the dry language of the law, this was the charge:\nFor alleged interference with the match ball, thus changing its\ncondition. Match Referee's decision: By acting on the match\nball, Tendulkar brought the game into disrepute (Icc Players\nand Team officials Code No.) and has been fined % ofhis\nmatch fee, plus a one Test ban suspended until the last day of\nDecember .\nTo understand why Indian cricket fans took to the streets in protest,\nwhy the Indian media was full of articles and editorials condemning\nDenness and why the BCCI under its president Jagmohan Dalmiya\nvirtually brought international cricket to a halt, is to understand the\nesteem in which Tendulkar is held in his country. This esteem has not\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fbeen earned easily, nor has it been built merely on a mountain of runs.\nIt had been gained the hard way, by being the ideal role model and\navoiding the many unsavoury controversies affecting Indian cricket\nover the years.\nMost shocking was the manner in which South Mrican captain\nShaun Pollock, in the same match, had pressurized the umpires into\nhanding out decisions against the Indian batsmen with appeals that\nwere loud, prolonged and provocative. The footage ofhis lbw appeals\nagainst Das and Laxman were shown over and over again on TV.\nSuddenly, years of resentment at the widely perceived\ndiscrimination against Asian players who receivedharsh punishments\nfrom match referees while 'white' nations were let bff scot-free, boiled\nover. Players like Glenn McGrath, Shaun Pollo~k, Allan Donald,\nAndrew Flintoff, Ricky Panting and Michael Slate~ had been let off\nlightly in the past for directing abuse at their oppo~ents. Tendulkar\nhimself had been at the receiving end of such behaviour, particularly\nfrom the Australians. What made the charge against Tendulkar\nparticularly ludicrous, even invalid, was that it had not been brought\nto the notice of the match referee by the two on-field umpires as per\nthe law. Technically, the umpires have to report the matter if they\nnotice the shape of the ball has been deliberately altered.\nInstead, it was a South Mrican TV producer who instructed his\ncameraman to focus on Tendulkar as he cleaned the seam of the ball of\nmud and grass on a wet day. The tapes were then handed over to\nDenness. This was contrary to the procedure laid down by the ICC and\nadded a diabolical twist to the controversy. Pakistan captain Wagar\nYounis expressed his outrage at the anomaly 'How can a match referee\ntake decisions on the basis of television footage when the on-field\numpires have not reported ball-tampering? The International Cricket\nCouncil must decide on that. How can a match referee take a decision\nin such a manner?' (Wisden.com)\nTechnically, Tendulkar was at fault. A new rule stipulated that he\nhad to inform the umpires while cleaning the ball. But the punishment\ndid not fit the 'crime'. Denness, once he had returned home, himself\nadmitted Tendulkar's fault was technical, and not a breach of the law.\nYear of Controversies\n\n\n\n\fHowever, before that, on the fifth morning of the Test, there was a\nridiculous press conference attended by Denness, at which he was\nprohibited by ICC regulations from saying a word or explaining his\nstand. Amidst all this tension, the Indian batsmen still had a Test and\na series to save. This they did admirably, considering the tremendous\npressure while hatting out the last day.\nDalmiya now demanded that Denness be removed from his post if\nthe third Test at Centurion was to be played. Or, he threatened to\nbring the team home. The United Cricket Board of South Mrica\nfound itself trapped between the BCCI, the ICC, the series sponsors and\nthe television company. Eventually, a compromise was reached with\nSouth Mrica's Dennis Lindsay standing in for Denness for the third\nmatch that was designated an unofficial Test by the ICC. India went\ndown in the Test by an innings and  runs. Either way, South Mrica\nhad won the series.\nTendulkar's form after that blazing  in the first innings of the\nfirst Test was something of a let-down. He followed it up with scores\nof , ,  (not out),  and . Back home, the storm was now\nbrewing around Sehwag and the first Test at Mohali against the touring\nEnglish team. The stipulation that he be dropped from one Test had\nnot been adhered to according to the ICC, as the Centurion match\nwhere he was not played was not deemed to be an official Test. It was\nonly after some brinkmanship that Sehwag was pulled out of the\nMohali Test at the eleventh hour and the series went ahead.\nThe tour had earlier been thrown into doubt with the English\ncricket board dithering over whether to go ahead following the post September security scenario in the subcontinent. Their indecision\nhad come in for much criticism in the Indian media. Now, with\nTendulkar under a cloud, the English and Australian media got a\nchance to hit back.\nOn  December in Bangalore, Tendulkar in his first statement\nfollowing his penalty, clarified that he was indeed trying to clean the\nball and never intended to do 'anything wrong'. 'Consciously I never\nwanted to do anything wrong. I only took the ball to remove the dust\nin it but the laws (about cleaning the ball) are different,' Tendulkar\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fsaid while receiving the Castro) Indian Cricketer of the Year Award.\nOne Australian journalist, among others, brushed aside the fury\noflndian fans as 'knee-jerk hubris'. It was as if they were gloating at\nthe thought that the Indian icon had finally been found guilty after a\nspotless record all these years. The English media's favourite whipping\nboy, Dalmiya, was once again a convenient target.\nOne of the few English writers who tried to understand what Sachin\nmeant to the Indian psyche was Simon Barnes. Writing in the Cricketer\nInternational Oanuary ), Barnes drew parallels between what Sir\nDon Bradman meant to Australia in the s and s and\nTendulkar's place in modern India. He also revealed that he had been\ntold by that doyen of cricket writers, John Woodcock, that he felt\nTendulkar was as good a batsman as Bradman. 'Not the view of a\nnutcase, not even an Indian,' wrote Barnes. 'I heard it from John\nWoodcock, former cricket correspondent of the Times and former editor\nofWtSden. So I take it seriously.' He continued, 'In India's turbulent\npresent he [Sachin] means as much as Brad man did to Australia in\nthe years of the Depression and incipient nationhood. In India's\nnationalistic climate, Tendulkar stands for Indian aspiration and India's\ndesire to fling off subservience and take a new station in the world.'\nHarsha Bhoglc in Wisden Cricket Monthly Oanuary ), lucidly\nexplained India's case in an article headlined 'Why India Has Been\nWronged.'\n'Somebody [in the Western media] should have had the sagacity\nto stand up and say that ifliberal, intelligent, moderate Indians were\nfeeling outraged by what had happened, then maybe they should try\nto see why .... By Denness' own admission he was not tampering with\nthe ball, nor even picking the seam. He was merely taking the grass off\nthe seam-an offence but a minor one .... The punishment was\ne:x\"traordinary, not so much because of the fine and suspended sentence,\nbut because of the opportunity it gave the world to call an honest man\na cheat. Worse still, Denness had no complaint from the on-field\numpires and refused to trust Tendulkar.'\nWhile the storm was still brewing, the England team under ChennaiYear of Controversies\n\n\n\n\fborn Nasser Hussain arrived in India--one of the most inexperienced\nteams to tour the country. Nobody in the team had previously played\na Test match in India. Alec Stewart, Robert Croft, Darren Gough and\nAndrew Caddick all withdrew from the Test series for one reason or\nthe other, though the last two would be back for the one-day series that\nfollowed. In the first Test at Mohali, India swept to victory by ten\nwickets on the strength of their batting and spin bowling, inside of\nfour days. All the predictions of another whitewash (England had\nbeen routed - when they toured last in ) appeared to be coming\ntrue.\nOnce again, it was obvious the spectators had eyes for only one\nman. When India batted in reply to England's , Deep Dasgupta\nscored his maiden Test century and, with Rahul Dravid, put on \nruns. The going was slow as the batsmen sought to build up a big lead.\nNot that those in the stands on the second day of the match had much\npatience for these tactics. Both Dravid and the wicketkeeper-opener\nwere regularly booed. It was not very pleasant and the most embarrassed\nperwn there was probably the next man to come in. Dravid, at the\nvital number three slot, had a new burden to bear: he was coming in\njust before Tendulkar. There was polite applause for Dasgupta when\nhe reached his century in close to six hours. But when he was out for\nexactly , the man everyone in the ground had been waiting for\nmade his grand appearance to a tumultuous applause.\nMost of the English mediamen were watching Tendulkar play at\nhome for the first time. The build up to the series in the English press\nhad almost solely focussed on Tendulkar and h;s place in Indian cricket\nand Indian society. For them, it was a novel experience to watch the\nstands erupt in joy at the mere sight of their hero.\nThe huge hype surrounding Tendulkar obviously had an effect\non the English players too, for they appeared to be initially overawed\nin his presence. Tendulkar came in with the score at  for . It had\nbeen quite a crawl till then. But in the short time he was at the crease\nbefore stumps on the second day, he thumped five sizzling boundaries\nto get  of the SO runs that were scored after his arrival at the wicket.\nThere was a great deal of overnight anticipation ofhis twenty-seventh\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fTest century, and the biggest crowd for the match turned up for it.\nHussain, in a desperate bid to plug the flow of runs from Sachin's bat\nhad his seamers, particularly Matthew Hoggard, bowl a consistent\noutside. off-stump line with an - field in place. Tendulkar's freeflowing stroke play was stifled and he faced  balls before being\ncaught behind off the persistent Hoggard for .\nEngland's tactics and Tendulkar's reaction to them were an\nominous sign of things to come. Mter the debacle at Mohali, England\nshowed great heart in getting the better of draws, both at Ahmedabad\nand Bangalore. England's batsmen bounced back from their first Test\ntrauma to pile up  when they batted first at Ahmedabad. India lost\n wickets for  before Tendulkar and Laxman's century stand hauled\nthem back. Once again, Hussain switched to containing tactics.\nHoggard, Craig White and Andrew Flintoffbowled well outside off\nstump to a - and - field-two slips, two gullies, backward point,\npoint, cover and mid-off.\nIt was obvious by now that England's intention was not so much\nfor their bowlers to get Sachin out, but rather to frustrate him so much\nthat he would throw away his wicket. Tendulkar was not flustered,\nthough, and got his runs steadily though not particularly quickly. His\nfirst  came from  balls. Then he decided to break free of the\nshackles in the post-lunch session of the third day.\nHoggard's negative line was brilliantly negated in one magical\nover. The ball was twice worked outside off, through the vacant leg\nside field, for boundaries. For the last ball of the over, Hussain was\nforced to move a fielder across. It made no difference. Once again, the\nball was whipped across his stumps and Sachin made three runs.\nEngland's fielders appeared awestruck as Hoggard went for  in that\nover.\nAnother  followed from off-spinner Richard Dawson's over and\nTendulkar got to his almost inevitable century with a savage pull off\nHoggard. The second  had taken just  balls. His dismissal for ,\ncaught by Hussain at mid-on off Hoggard, was disappointing, just\nwhen he had got on top of the bowling and the tactics. 'I was very\ndisappointed,' the centurion said at the press conference at the end of\nYear of Controversies\n\nlOS\n\n\fthe day. 'I made a hundred but I was hoping to keep going so that we\ncould get as close to England's total as possible.'\nThe century brought him level with Steve Waugh and Allan\nBorder in his eighty-eighth Test. Now only Bradman () and\nGavaskar () were ahead of him. Significantly, it was also the fiftieth\ncentury of his first-class career since his first on debut in  against\nGujarat. This was his two hundred and seventy-third innings in his\none hundred and seventy-sixth match, and he joined four other\nIndians with -plus centuries.\nEngland delayed their declaration to set India an improbable target\nof from  overs. Behind the delay-no team had scored -plus\nto win a Test in India-was the fear in the England captain's mind of\nanother flurry of runs from Tendulkar. In the event, he scored  from\n balls as India were determined not to go for the runs.\nIt was obvious by now that just one player out of was dictating\nthe trend of the entire series. Hussain's obsession with Tendulkar had\nbecome all-consuming.\nFormer England captain Mike Brearley summed up quite\nbeautifully in the Guardian ( December ), the special place\nTendulkar enjoys in India: 'Perhaps it is in his Hindu roots that\nTendulkar finds the peace of mind to carry without either arrogance\nor panic the load of national fervour that lands on his stocky shoulders.\nIf it is in one's karma to be the Indian Bradman, then all that is to be\ndone is to try one's best and thank God.'\nThe Bangalore Test was severely curtailed by rain and a draw was\nalways on the cards. Once again, though, England gained a healthy\nfirst innings lead. India had won the series -, but there was talk of a\n'moral' victory for the raw Englishmen. Hussain was being described\nas the best England captain since Brearley. There were comparisons\nwith Douglas Jardine, the proponent of the hated 'Bodyline' bowling\nin the - series in Australia. There were indeed some uncanny\nsimilarities: the peaked cap, the angular nose and the place of birth\nQardine too was born in India, though of Scottish parents). But most\nstriking of all was what the press, both in India and England, were\nreferring to as 'Bodyline II'.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fJardine's attempt to stem the massive flow of runs from the blade\nof the incomparable Sir Donald Bradman had worked to the extent\nthat his average was cut from -plus to just over , and England\nwon the 'Ashes' back. The sour taste left by the negating of fair play,\nhowever, threatened to cause a split in the Empire. Now,  years later,\nthere was no Empire left and no unfair intimidation either. But there\nwas one common motive-a batsman with the ability to dominate\nhad to be stopped at any cost. The bowler entrusted with keeping\nTendulkar on a leash was the tall left-arm spinner Ashley Giles. Giles\noperated to a leg-side line with a packed on-side field, bowling over\nthe wicket in the rough behind Tendulkar's legs in order to frustrate\nhim. Even wicketkeeper James Foster stationed himself well outside\nthe leg stump.\n'A Moral Win, but at What Price?' was the headline to Brearley's\nreport of the Test in Wisden Cricket Monthly (February ). 'Nasser\nHussain is an inventive thinker, a superb motivator, a steely leader.\nBut his Bodyline II tactics against Tendulkar took the fun out of\ncricket,' he wrote. Tendulkar made a mockery once again of the offstump line ofEngland's pace attack, forcing Hussain to change tactics\nand switch the field. Flintoffbegan to pepper the batsmen round the\nwicket down the leg side as the fast bowlers had done in -,\nthough not to such devastating physical effect. The rules had been\naltered shortly after the 'Bodyline I' series to restrict the number of\nfielders allowed to crouch around the bat, waiting for the ball to be\nfended of( Hussain's tactics were perhaps the supreme compliment to\nthe supreme batsman of the modern era. Not that Tendulkar was in\nany mood to appreciate it at the time.\nBy the close of the truncated second day, Tendulkarwas on . He\nhad \u00a3iled to score off of the first  balls he had faced. Things got\nout of hand and the umpires had to intervene to cool things down at\nthe final drinks interval of the day when Tendulkar and Das indulged\nin a finger-wagging session with Hussain. The subject of the heated\ndiscussion was obvious. It was one of the very rare occasions when\nTendulkar was seen to lose his temper on the field of play.\nOn the third morning, he managed just  runs in  minutes.\nYear of Controversies\n\n\n\n\fTime and again, he used his backside or his pads instead of his bat to\nknock Giles' deliveries away. It was obvious he was trying to make a\npoint. You bowl this line all day and I will keep using my 'backside'\nplay. As Brearley explained in the Wzsden Cricket Monthly (February\n): 'Legside attack precludes almost all the classical strokes of\nbatting. It becomes impossible to swing the arms freely at the ball if it\nis constantly leaping at your ribs or scuttling around behind your\ncalves. The sweep is hard to control because the bounce of the ball is\nunpredictable.' Both Brearley and Sunil Gavaskar called for legislation\nto outlaw such bowling. They felt the umpires should have been\nempowered to call 'wide'.\nTendulkar was joined at the crease by Sehwag. Remarkably, the\nman with just two Tests behind him proceeded to show just how Giles\ncould be mastered. Admittedly, the 'new Tendulkar' was living\ndangerously. He was dropped at slip on one, and time and again he\nwas beaten outside the off stump. But he brought the first signs of\nforceful batting into the Indian innings. Six ofhis  boundaries in an\ninnings of  from  balls were off the spinner. He went over\nmidwicket, he played a cross-bat slog and there was a reverse sweep\nthat went with the speed of a tracer bullet to the boundary.\nHis ego piqued by this audacious display-perhaps all the talk of\nthe 'new Tendulkar' was getting on his nerves-the role model decided\nto finally chance his arm. He succeeded briefly, smashing  in an\nover from Giles. But in the next, trying another heave, he was stranded\noutside the crease and Foster had him stumped for .\nIt was the first time in  Tests that he had been dismissed thus.\nJudging by the celebrations, one would have thought England had\ngot him for a first ball duck.\nGavaskar has long attacked the attitude of English cricket and\ncricketers and this display of theirs gave him ample fodder. 'They\nonce again confirmed (with their tactics) that they are a boring side\nthat drives spectators to despair,' he declared in the Hindustan Times\n( December  ).\nNone, though, was more scathing than former Somerset captain\nPeter Roebuck, one of the most perceptive cricket writers. As he\nlOB\n\nSachin\n\n\fobserved in the Age, Melbourne ( December ):\nEngland pretends to be the guardian of the game, yet does more\nharm than all the rest put together. That the batsman in these\ninstances was Sachin Tendulkar hardly needs saying. After all,\nthe Poms did not hesitate to attack The Dan's skull when they\ncouldn't get him out, an approach so effective that it was\npromptly used against less gifted willow-wielders, and then the\nPoms sacked their captain and fastest bowler. Tendulkar is the\nmodern master of batting. It is a privilege to watch him and\nbowl to him. To sec him reduced to kicking the ball away like a\ndopey tail-ender in the closing minutes of a tight contest was to\nsee the game betrayed. England has lots of young players and it\nhasn't been much of an education for them. IfTcndulkar has\nany sense he'll bat till Christmas. If the game has any sense it\nwill outlaw these puritanical practices. Tendulkar gives the\nbowlers a chance and he is human. Let them try to get him out\nwith skill and not cleverness.\nWrote former Hampshire captain Mark Nicholas in the Daily\n\nTelegraph ( December ):\nWhat we were watching was a legal, non-violent bodylinctype tactic, an attempt to minimise the impact of an awesome\nopponent. I twas well thought out and applied with accuracy ....\nWith a terrific performance at Ahmedabad they proved to\nthemselves that they could match  of the Indian team but\nadmitted the th, Tendulkar, had the wood on them. So they\nresolved to '\u00b7 -:ep him in check. The line Giles bo~rlcd in\nAhmedabad was very good, consistently on or around leg stump,\nand with the seamers sticking to a line outside off stump the\nmaster batsman was tested fair and square. He made an\nunforgettable hundred.\nThe differences from Ahmedabad and here in Bangalore are\nthat England have increased the distance between him and the\nYear of Cont'roversies\n\n\n\n\fball and have at times bowled the same line from both ends.\nThis compromises the entertainment which, we must continue\nto assume, is the point of it all. The line in this case between\nwhat is fair and what compromises the spirit of the game is as\nfine as it gets.\nNot surprisingly, Tendulkar was the Man of the Series with \nruns at . . He would also be Man of the Series in the one-day\ngames that followed, after Christmas, in which the visitors came back\nfrom - down to finish on -. Sachin had scores of, , , \n(not out),  and . An  century against England was still elusive,\nhowever, after ten years.\nThere were two memorable century opening stands between\nSachin and Sehwag in the ODis, during which, but for the names on\ntheir shirts, it would have been virtually impossible to tell the two\napart. In the third match at Chennai, they hammered  in the first\n overs; at Kanpur in the next it was  in , Tendulkar scoring \nnot out from  balls and Schwag  from .\nThe talk of 'moral victory' for the English camp was more valid\nthis time.\n\n\n\nSachin Man and Myth\n\nMy family is altogether a different issue.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nIt's not easy being Sachin Tendulkar. In a vast country like India,\ncricket and movies are about the only outlets for a population of a\nbillion-plus, of whom most lead a mundane, often perilous existence.\nLife can get pretty claustrophobic for us ordinary folk. Imagine what\nis must be like for cricketers and movie stars.\nI have seen Tendulkar mobbed wherever he goes. Yet, he rarely\nloses his cool. And the adulation is not confined to India either. In\nDhaka, Sachin, Sourav Ganguly and Wasim Akram are the reigning\ndeities. During the October  inaugural Test match, I witnessed\nthis adulation first-hand. In a country where cricket fanaticism rivals\neven the kind witnessed in India, it can sometimes get scary. Certainly,\nGanguly looked terrified as he raced the short distance from the dressi;.g\nrooms at the Bangabandhu Stadium to the team bus. Thousands of\nhands sought him out from the crowd of fans milling inside and\noutside the stadium. I twas equally hysterical when it came to Sachin's\nturn to run the gamut of the hordes. 'Sochin, Sochin,' they screamed.\nI could not help but notice his beatific smile. He was actually lapping\nup the adulation. It reminded me of old film clips depicting the Beatles\nmania of the s.\n'It would be terrible if only  people came to watch. As a cricketer\nI try to give pleasure, and the more people that watch and applaud, the\nmore pleasure I get myself I wouldn't swap it,' Tendulkar told Mark\nNicholas in an interview in the Daily Telegraph ( December ).\nNicholas, the former Hampshire captain, spent the whole interview\n\n\fseemingly probing for a chink in the Tendulkar armour. He exulted\nafter the answer above: 'So there's an ego, at last, saved for the stage\nand the curtain calls.'\nHow could it be any different? Every entertainer, whether on stage,\nscreen or field of play, has an ego. Tendulkar has accomplished what\nall superstars strive for, to harness that ego in a positive manner. Ego\nhas driven some international sports persons, when they visit India, to\nbring the media in tow as they do their good deed for the day. It is the\ndone thing to be seen and heard attempting to alleviate the misery of\nIndia's teeming downtrodden. When was the last time you saw even a\nphotograph ofTendulkar at a charity function? Yet, he gives of his\nspare time unstintingly.\nJournalist Joe Hoover knows this hidden side ofTendulkar well.\nSports editor ofDeccan Herald, Hoover has organized numerous charity\nauctions and functions where Tendulkar is the star attraction. 'He is\nso approachable and he never says no,' Hoover told me. 'He doesn't\nneed the publicity because unlike some other sportspersons, he sees\nno need to use these acts to improve his image.' Hoover recalled an\nincident in Pakistan in  when he telephoned Tendulkar in his\nhotel room and asked him if he could give some signed bats for a\ncharity auction. 'Within minutes he was on the phone, informing his\nbat manufacturers in Meerut to send over a dozen to New Delhi for\nthis purpose.'\nThroughout this book there have been excerpts from numerous\ninterviews with Tendulkar by Vijay Lokapally. As the cricket\ncorrespondent for the Hindu and the Sportstar, Lokapally has\nundoubtedly interviewed him more often than any other journalist.\nHe spoke to me about his interaction with Sachin over the years:\nSachin once said to me, \"Kiti lihishil?\" (How much will you\nwrite)? ... I first m~t him at a Wills Trophy match at Kanpur.\nThis was before his  Test debut. The next occasion was in\nNew Delhi just before the Pakistan tour, his first. He and Vivek\nRazdan, the other debutant were very excited. And do you know,\nhe has that same excitement about playing cricket after all these\nMan and Myth\n\n\n\n\fyears?\nI have always been impressed by the dignified way he carries\nhimselfboth on and off the field. Despite all his fame and wealth,\nhe is very down to earth. That has not changed a bit in all the\nyears I have known him.\nFriends, family, food (particularly seafood-he enjoys a spot of\ncooking too), cricket and music. These are Tendulkar's passions in\nlife. Lokapally says you can guess which hotel room is his by the\nmusic blaring from it. 'Dire Straits used to be his favourite group. But\nthese days he is into old Hindi songs. He seeks these out and gets them\nspecially recorded.'\n(This incidentally is another trait he shares with Sir Don Bradman,\nwho would lock himself up in his hotel room and play his\ngramophone records after the day's play.)\n'Sachin Tendulkar is an important person of our country. He is\nour country's wealth and we will protect him,' said Mumbai's\nCommissioner of Police, M.N.Singh. This followed reports that\nTendulkar and Ganguly were kidnap targets for militant groups.\nAnother heavy price offame is the loss of privacy. 'Ask me anything\nyou want about cricket, but keep my family out of this,' he has told\njournalists repeatedly.\nWife Anjali, daughter Sara and son Arjun are the centre ofSachin's\nexistence,just as his parents and siblings were when he was growing\nup. 'My family life is altogether a different issue. I have always kept it\na very private affair and I don't want that to be public. Everybody is\nwatching whatever I do on the field,' he told the f.#ek ( November\n). 'Even. today they [his family] look after me and ensure that my\nfeet are on the ground,' he said when asked how he copes with all the\nhopes and adulation of the fans. 'Not Tiger Woods, not even Michael\nJordan lives with such a following,' wrote Nicholas in the Daily\nTelegraph interview.\n'It has been harder for my family than for me to be honest. I've\nknown no other way. A couple of times I tried going out for the evening\nin Bombay in disguise but that didn't work too well, so now I just stay\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fin. Now when I go to pray I go late at night to the temples which are\nempty and -uiet,' he told Nicholas. His favourite temple is the Uddan\nGanesh temple in Bandra which he visits with Anjali, often after\nmidnight.\nSachin has spent all his life in Bandra, first with his parents, brothers\nand sisters at Sahil}'a Sahawas in Bandra (East) and since the middle of\n, at the swank Le Mer apartments in Bandra (West). They may\nshare virtually the same address, but Bandra (East) and Bandra (West)\nare worlds apart. West looks down its nose at East,' says one long-time\nresident of the more upmarket side of town. For the first few years of\ntheir marriage, Sachin and Anjali stayed in a separate flat in the same\nbuilding where he grew up. Le Mer was recommended to him by\nPrahlad Kakkar who has been directing Sachin's commercials for a\ndecade now. The Tendulkars bought a duplex apartment there in mid\n. 'The apartment block has more glittering stars than the milky\nway,' one Mumbai sports journalist told me. In that sense, Sachin has\nmade the transformation from his solid middle-class youth to the\nworld ofMumbai's glitterati.\nThe influence of Anjali and her parents, Anand (an international\nbridge player) and Annabelle Mehta (who is English and a leading\nphilanthropist) has played a large part in this transition. According to\na family friend, when Anjali and he first met and started dating, Mrs\nMehta would disguise Sachin in a wig and beard and smuggle the\ncouple out to the family's holiday homes in Lonavalla and Goa. The\nMehtas arc among Mumbai's wealthiest families, a fixture on the\ncity's social circuit. Which is very distant from Sachin's roots. But he\nstill keeps in touch with his old school friends and often drops by to\nenjoy his mother's seafood dishes, which he relishes. ('Favourite Food:\nAnything cooked by mother.') Anjali was a practising paediatrician\ntill the birth of Arjun in . Now she looks after the two kids. It is\nthe daughter who has inherited her father's curly hair. As for Arjun,\nhis father has already gifted him a plastic bat and ball. 'It may be a\nbatsman's game. But I would want him to become a good all-rounder,'\nsays the proud father with characteristic determination.\nWife and kids (accompanied by a maid) fly out to be with Sachin\nMan and Myth\n\n\n\n\fon long tours abroad. He obviously cannot be parted from them for\nlong.\nSo how good a father is he?\n'It's not just bull about spending \"quality time\" with his children,'\nneighbour and friend Kakkar says. 'While other kids are rocked to\nsleep with a pat on the back, Sachin drives Arjun round and round the\nbuilding in his Mere at night and puts him to sleep' (Times of India\nSunday Review,  December ).\nArjun has become an enthusiastic cricketer who bats left-handed\nand often accompanies his father to net practice.\nIn May  it was revealed that Tendulkar had paid Rs.  crores\nfor an old mansion near Carter Road, Bandra West in suburban\nMumbai. Built in the s, it is spread over , square feet and is\nundergoing extensive renovations.\n\nJll\n\nSachin Debacle Down Under\n\nThat bat is so heavy but he's got so much time, he waves it around like a\ntoothpick.-Brett Lee\nThe team for Australia generated the usual debate and criticism, most\nof it centred un the exclusion of Mohammad Azharuddin and Nayan\nMongia. 'Mongia was thought to be a self-centred cricketer, which\ncould be debated and Azharuddin was obviously held in poor esteem\nby the new coach and also skipper Tendulkar. To be sidelined without\na proper trial was not the best way to treat a senior cricketer like\nAzharuddin,' wrote Vijay Lokapally in the Sportstar ( November\n). By now, both the players were under a cloud of suspicion over\ntheir role in corrupt cricket practices. As we have seen in the excerpt\nfrom the CBI report, Tendulkar did not feel Azhar was giving  per\ncent during his first stint as captain. And Mongia's crazy shot in the\nclosing stages of the Chennai Test against Pakistan was still, no doubt,\nfresh in his batting partner's mind. Tendulkar would also tell the CB!\nhow furious he was with Prabhakar and Mongia for their notorious\ngo-slow in the Kanpur oor against the West Indies in .\nBizarrely, Mongia did finally make it to Australia. But not tor long.\nHe was flown out as a backup for M.S.K. Prasad when it was thought\nhe might not be fit for the second Test. He played in one match (against\nTasmania), hung around for a while and then returned to India\ndespondent, even as Prasad made a miraculous recovery. When he\narrived in Australia, his reception by the captain and the coach was\nfrosty. It was obvious that Tendulkar and Kapil Dev were trying to\nforge a united front against the selectors. But not all their demands\n\n\fwere granted at the selection meeting.\nThe captain wanted Mumbai left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni in\nthe squad, reinforcing the widely held belief that Tendulkar veered\ntowards players from his own side. The claims of all other left-arm\nspinners were ignored in the process. The selectors put their collective\nfoot down on this.\nThere was enormous anticipation and excitement in Australia over\nthe visit of the Indian team, with the focus, naturally enough, on the\ncaptain. Tendulkar had made a huge impact on his previous tour\nDown Under in -, with his brilliant centuries at Sydney and\nPerth, while still a teenager. The intervening years had seen him mature\ninto the world's greatest batsman and Australians were delighted as\nwell by the stamp of approval accorded to the Indian master from their\nvery own living legend, Sir Don Bradman.\nThere was an additional edge to the contest, for Australia under\nMark Taylor had been ambushed by the Indians on home turfjust the\nyear before. Now, guided by Steve Waugh, they were having a vintage\nyear. After their triumph in the World Cup, they had whitewashed\nNew Zealand and Pakistan at home, at the start of a fantastic run of\nvictories that would last till March .\nSadly, as the tour progressed, it became increasingly apparent that\nthe Indians had developed a siege mentality. This was brought about\nnot just by the dazzling quality of the opposition, but also by the\nhostile local press and highly contentious umpiring. The Australian\ncricket fraternity always presents a united front at home and this time\nwas no different. Traditionally, the top player or captain is made a\nspecial target. Tendulkar fell into both ctegories and he was made to\npay a heavy price. The trend was set even before the first Test, when\numpire Darrell Hair decided to stamp his authority on the tourists in\nthe tour match against New South Wales at Sydney.\n'Twice in that match, Darrell Hair played the headmaster to\nperfection, admonishing the tourists as if they were errant children\ncaught smoking in a sehoul toilet,' wrote Harsha Bhogle in Wisden\nCricketers' Almanack Australia (- ). Hair's bullying tactics had\nlong been resented by teams from Asia. The Indian team management\nDebacle Down Under\n\n\n\n\fmade it clear that they would not be happy if he stood in the Test\nseries. He did, though, in the third and final Test at Sydney.\nThe high esteem in which Tendulkar is held by Australian cricket\nfollowers was best illustrated when Sachin was introduced to Sachin\nVoigt at the Adelaide Oval, venue of the first Test. The seven-year-old\nhad been named by his father Ian Voigt following Tendulkar's exploits\non the previous tour to Australia. 'Dear Sachin, keep smiling, Sachin\nTendulkar,' Tendulkar signed on the mini-bat presented by his young\nnamesake who had waited patiently for three hours to meet his hero.\nThat would be about the last pleasant memory of Adelaide for\nTendulkar.\nAfter a promising start by the Indian pace bowlers-Australia: \nfor ---it was downhill all the way for the visitors. A crushing defeat by\n runs set the pattern for the rest of the series. It did not help matters\nthat Tendulkar was the victim, in both innings, of hotly debated\ndecisions handed out by Australian umpire Daryl Harper, which only\nadded to the growing suspicion that he was being unfairly targeted.\nReplying to Australia's , the Indians were  for  at close on the\nsecond day, with Tendulkar and Ganguly both on . The skirmish\nbetween McGrath and Tendulkar on the second evening had been\nbrief but captivating. In their only previous meeting in a Test match,\nthe Australian speedster had bowled the Indian captain for a duck in\nNew Delhi in . Now Tendulkar, coming in at a shockingly low\nnumber five in the order, was in a rare defensive mood as he batted for\n minutes and  balls for  runs. Time and again, McGrath tested\nhim outside off stump, and each time the batsman just waved his bat\naway and let the ball through to the keeper. Having weathered that\nstorm, it was a different Tendulkar who took charge on the third\nmornmg.\nHe hit the first three deliveries of the second over from fast bowler\nMichael Kasprowicz to the boundary-an on drive, a flick to square\nleg and a cover drive. With Ganguly for company,  runs were added\nin  overs. Tendulkar's  came from  balls and he was just getting\ninto his stride when he was adjudged to have been caught bat and pad\nat short leg offWarne for . The replays showed he had clearly missed\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe ball. The score was- for , and with the wind taken out of the\nIndian sails, the innings folded up for .\nWorse was to follow. Mter Australia declared their second innings\nat  for , it became a matter of survival for the Indians. But they\nfolded up for  with the captain out for a duck. He ducked under a\nMcGrath delivery-the fifth one he faced-that did not rise as expected,\nsank to his haunches and was struck on the left shoulder. Mter some\ndeliberation, Harper_ raised his finger. The Australian players and\nmedia immediately sprang to the defence of their own. The Indian\ncamp, on the other hand, was incensed. 'I was disappointed that I got\nout,' was Tendulkar's terse comment.\nThe question was whether the ball would have hit the stumps or\nnot. Sunil Gavaskar was convinced it would not have, the Australians\nwere convinced it would have. Back home, the dismissal was shown\nover and over again on television, with various pundits passing\njudgement in the cozy confines of the studio. Mohinder Amarnath's\ncommem was rather pithy. 'I had always been taught that the umpire's\nverdict is final, so where is the debate?' The Indian journalists travelling\nwith the team were scathing in their dispatches and it seemed paranoia\nwas gripping the team. That, of course, was exactly what the Aussies\nwanted.\n'The Indians had all along feared this kind of situation and when\nyour best batsman becomes a sort of marked man it becomes tough on\nthe team. If the Tendulkar episode took away the sheen from the Aussie\nvictory the fault lay with the umpire. He was not convincing at all,'\nwrote Lokapally in the Sportstar ( December ).\nThe series was won and lost in the traditional Boxing Day Test at\nMelbourne. But before that, Tendulkar enthralled one and all with\nhis third century Down Under and his fifth against Australia in \nTests. India this time were beaten by  runs in a match curtailed by\nrain. Mter Australia once again crossed  in their first innings, India\nwere struggling at  for  at the end of the third day, with Tendulkar\nholding the batting together with his twenty-second Test century. But\nit was fast bowler Brett Lee, who grabbed five wickets on Test debut,\nwho captured most of the headlines. Lee bowled lightning quick and\nDebacle Down Under\n\n\n\n\fonly Tendulkar-now batting at number four-managed to defy his\nhostile pace. Ninth out at , he was caught in the deep, hooking\nDamien Fleming. It was the only mistake he made while facing \nballs. Even as he got a standing ovation from the crowd of, he\nwas furious with himself for the poor shot. This time, though, there\ncould be no excuse on the umpiring front.\nIt appeared as if there was a game within the game going on in the\nmiddle: Tendulkar v Australia. Only twice was he beaten, prompting\nLee to exclaim in awe: 'That bat is so heavy but he's got so much time,\nhe waves it around like a toothpick.'\nThere was too, a little gem of an innings when India batted to save\nthe Test the second time round. The battle with Warne was once again\nengrossing stuff Finlly, the leg-spinner had him lbw for  as he\npadded up to one that went straight on. The Man of the Match award\nwas little consolation. As the world celebrated the dawn of the new\nmillennium, Tendulkar must have looked back at  with decidedly\nmixed feelings: His father's death, India's disappointing World Cup\nperformance, his back worries, the captaincy drama and the miseries\nin Australia ....All these factors combined to make it a year to forget.\nThe only silver lining was the birth of his second child, Arjun, in\nMumbai on  September.\nAustralia completed a - whitewash with victory by an innings\nand  runs injust three days in the third and final Test at Sydney,\nthe first Test of the year . There was a brief flash of brilliance in\nTendulkar's first-innings  as he once again duelled with McGrath.\nHe took  runs otT one over from the fast bowler before being given\nout lbw for , a shocking decision by Zimbabwean umpire Ian\nRobinson. McGrath sent the batsman on his way with a crude gesture\nand a mouthful of abuse, and was lucky to get just a slap on the wrist\nfrom match referee Ranjan Madugalle. The Sri Lankan had fined\nVenkatesh Prasad heavily for a much lesser offence in the second Test\nand all this added to India's frustration. It was the third ti:ne in five\ninnings that Tendulkar had got the short end of the stick from the\numpires. And despite a defiant century by VV S. Laxman in the second\ninnings, India's was a lost cause.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar's disappointment at the end of the Test was heightened\nby anger over the behaviour of the two umpires on the final day.\nInevitably, Hair was in the thick of things, refusing the Indian captain's\nrequest tor sawdust to be sprinkled on damp patches behind the stumps.\nOn the boundary line, Prasad was the target for louts throwing shoes.\nBut the umpires ignored Tendulkar's plea to step in. At the post-match\npress conference, Man of the Series Tendulkarwas livid.\n'In all the years that I have known Tendulkar-and I have known\nhim since he was -- have never known him to be as worked up at\na press conference,' said Harsha Bhogle who pinpointed Hair's attitude\ntowards Asian teams as the crux of the problem. Tendulkar was asked\nafter the series ifhe felt the umpires had targeted him, but he refused\nto be drawn, saying it was probably a coincidence.\nDespite the rout, crowds for the Tests were huge. And they had\ncome to see one player and one player alone. Not even Sir Donald\nBrad man in his last international summer at home in - caused\nmore excitement at the turnstiles, according to veteran Australian\njournalist Mike Coward. Coward, a man with a deep affection for\nIndian cricket and cricketers, wrote an impassioned open letter to\nTendulkar in the Weekend Australian (- January ). It concerned\nhis silence over various controversial issues that had bedevilled the\nseason. Interestingly, Sunil Gavaskar wrote a similar critique in one\nof his columns in . He too gently chided his protege for not\ntaking a public stand on important cricket issues.\nFollowing are excerpts from Coward's article under the headline\n'Sounds ofSilence Magnify Mystique of Cultural Divide':\nDear Sachin,\nThese people [the Australian cricket public] also want to hear\nfrom you; to know your thoughts on so many matters affecting\ncricket in India and around the world.\nAs the game's pre-eminent batsman and your country's\ncaptain you are in a priceless position to make a difference.\nWith respect, you have said little to arouse interest since you've\nbeen in the country.\nDebacle Down Under\n\n\n\n\fIndeed, your press conferences have been little more than\nwell practiced exercises in political and diplomatic correctness.\nPerhaps you were following instructions laid down by the\nfaceless powerbrokers oflndian cricket. ...\nOr could it have been that you were so badly wounded in\nyour first incarnation as captain that you now simply do your\nduty?\n... there is a need for a powerful, persuasive and contemporary\nvoice from the region [the Indian subcontinent].\nSachin, you are recognized throughout the cricket world as a\nthoughtful, self-effacing, intelligent young man of great\nintegrity and quiet dignity.\nYou can be the voice as well as the face of the game in its most\npopulous and increasingly influential region.\nRest assured, the people (of Australia) who await your every\nstroke will hang on your every word.\nAnd there are serious matters confronting the game which\nwould benefit greatly from your involvement.\nIs this [speculation of an anti-Asian sentiment running\nthrough the game and one that is most easily identified in\nAustralia] merely a perception or a reality and has it impacted\non your visit?\n.... after much too long, Australian cricket wants to know more\nabout India and Indian cricket and cricketers.\nSachin, you are in a powerful position. You can make a real\ndifference.\nTendulkar's response to these criticisms was that he was more\nworried about what he did on the ground than off the field; he hadn't\naccepted the captaincy to be drawn into controversies.\nWriting in  (Sportstar,  January ), Sunil Gavaskar made\na similar point:\nWhen he was captain of the team to Australia he had the media\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthere looking for a comment or two about how to give the\ngame a new direction. Owing to his phenomenal batting in the\nhome series, the Australian media was waiting to lap up every\nword of his but he disappointed them by hardly saying anything\nof consequence .... As one India-loving Australian veteran\nmediaperson said: 'It was as if\"no comment\" was two words\ntoo many for him.' Perhaps Tendulkar was taking shelter under\nthe ICC Code of Conduct regarding comments, but there comes\na time when the good of cricket counts before anything else\nand one has to stick one's neck out for the betterment of the\ngame. For, when Tendulkar speaks the world will stop and listen.\nThere was further misery in the one-day tri-series where the Indians\nlost every match to Australia and Pakistan, except one. That was at\nAdelaide where they beat Pakistan by  runs. India's failure was largely\nput down to Tendulkar's poor run. At one stage he admitted that the\npressures of the one-day game and the non-stop cricket were proving\ntoo taxing. He had just one substantial innings,  against Pakistan at\nHobart, where India lost by  runs.\nThere were two other incidents that further upset his frame of\nmind and must have been factors in his shock decision to step down\nfrom the captaincy. Pakistan's young all-rounder Abdul Razzaq accused\nTendulkar of tampering with the ball in the Adelaide game on \nJanuary. The charge was dismissed as 'frivolous and without\nfoundation' by match referee Cammie Smith and umpires Hair and\nSteve Davis. The Indian camp was furious at Razzaq's impertinence.\nAnd the Pakistan team management reacted by dropping him on\ndisciplinary grounds for the next match at Perth, even though the\nofficial reason given was that he was injured.\nIn that match in Perth, Tendulkar received yet another terrible\ndecision, given out caught behind offWaqar Younis by umpire Simon\nTaufel for . He had struck four boundaries off Akram and Wagar\nand looked to be getting into his stride when he was handed down the\nlatest shocker. For the first time in two months, something snapped\nand he showed his displeasure before leaving the crease. It had been a\nDebacle Down Under\n\n\n\n\fgruelling time for the team and the captain in particular, and he must\nhave been relieved when it was all over.\nThis was the first time since England in   that India had been\nwhitewashed -. The debacle of the ODI tri-series was really the last\nstraw on the captain's tender back.\n\n\n\nSac hi n\n Stepping Down\n\nI as captain take the moral responsibilityfor theJailure.-Sachin Tendulkar\nWas Sachin Tendulkar's opposition to the inclusion of Mohammad\nAzharuddin based on sound reasoning, or was it another aspect of his\noften stubborn attitude towards the selectors? Confrontation with the\nselection panel loomed again when the team for the Australian tour\nwas being picked, as we have already discussed in the previous chapter.\nThe bone of contention was the inclusion of Azhar and Nayan\nMorygia. The wicketkeeper had, of course, made a brief appearance\nDown Under, but was soon sent packing. The face-off-the five\nselectots and J.Y Lele on one side and coach Kapil Dev and his captain\non the other-was back in the headlines when the time came to make\nchanges for the one-day tri-series following the whitewash in the Test\nsenes.\nHere Tendulkar got his way, with Mumbai teammate Sameer\nDighe flying out to replace the disappointing M.S.K. Prasad behind\nthe stumps. Considering the batting failures in the Tests, there were\nalso strong indications that Azhar would he part of the one-day team.\nKapil and Sachin, however, would have nothing to do with it. 'The\nplane bringing Azhar to Australia will be the same one taking Kapil\nand me back home,' Tendulkar is reported to have told his teammates.\nBut how long could this attitude persist? Sooner or later the two\nstalwarts were sure to force their way back into the side on the basis of\nboth form and reputation.\nThe second day of the tour-opening match of the South African\n\n\fteam against the Board President's XI at the Brabourne Stadium in\nMumbai was on  February . It was also the day the selectors\nwould announce the team for the first Test at Mumbai's Wankhede\nStadium, starting in four days' time.\nBut before the team could be announced, Tendulkar walked into\nthe press box at the Brabourne Stadium to make a dramatic\nannouncement ofhis own. Accompanied by chairman of the Selection\nCommittee Chandu Borde and Lele, he walked up to the microphone\nand began: 'I have an announcement to make.' He then read out his\nstatement:\nI just want to make a few things very clear. At the beginning of\nthe season when Mr Wadekar, the then chairman of the\nselection committee, met vvith me and offered me the captaincy,\nI showed my reluctance to accept the job as I felt that I was not\nmentally prepared at that time.\nIn spite of that, when my name was announced as captain, I\ntook up the task as I was one of the most experienced players\nand the selectors felt at that time I was the best man to do the\njob. I accepted the captaincy knowing that this Australian tour\nwould be a very difficult one ,judging from the Australian team's\nrecent performance-they had won the World Cup.\nI tried my best but nothing worked out for us. I do not want to\noffer any excuses for a poor performance in Australia, but I as\ncaptain take the moral responsibility for the failure. I feel sorry\nfor not living up to the expectations of my countrymen who\nalways support us and wish well for the team.\nI have decided after a lot of thought to step down from the\ncaptaincy after the forthcoming two Test matches against South\nMrica. That will give some time to the next captain to get\nprepared. I assure you that I will give my best as I have always\ndone in the past, and I am ready to play in the team under\nanyone and with anyone.\nThe press were stunned for a moment. Then they began firing\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fquestions. Tendulkar stonewalled the more sensitive ones and left the\nbox. Borde then announced the team, and surrprise, surprise, Azhar\nand Mongia were back in. Now it was Borde's turn to be in the firing\nline. Inevitably, most questions were about the return of Azhar and\nthe stepping down of the captain. We tried to persuade him to continue,\nbut he had made up his mind. It was his decision. There is nothing we\ncan do about it.'\nBut what was the story behind the scene? Conspiracy theories\nabounded. Perhaps a loose understanding was reached between\nTendulkar, Ganguly andJadeja at the World Cup, that whoever was\nmade captain would resign if Mohammad Azharuddin was picked;\nperhaps Tendulkar arrived with two letters in his pocket for the selection\nmeeting, one with the team he wanted, the other his resignation. Told\nthat Azhar was picked, he had his resignation ready. The third theory\nwas that Tendulkar decided to quit after the Test series so that his\nconfidant Jadeja could take over as captain since India were to play\nonly one-day cricket till November. But of course, there was nothing\nto prove either of these theories right. As Sanjay Manjrekar\ncommented: '[Sachin] has perfect timing when it comes to batting,\nbut don't expect him to be perfect at everything. I think the player\nTendulkar is more etTective than the captain-player Tendulkar.'\nWriting for Indya.com after Ganguly was eventually appointed to\nsucceed Tendulkar, this is how Wadekar assessed the man on whose\nshoulders he had thrust the captaincy just eight months earlier:\nI'm convinced that Sachin will never lead the Indian side in\nfuture. And that is sad. He has perhaps all the ingredients tu\nbecome a good captain. Every member of the team respects his\ngreat talent. He is a thinker, an essential factor for a captain.\nSachin also leads from the front. He can crush any attack in the\nworld with his batting on any wicket. He also mixes with\neveryone in the team. What was it then lacking in him that he\ncould hardly win any series?\nI think he gets too much involved in the game. He expects his\nplayers to perform at the level where he performs. That is just\nStepping Down\n\n\n\n\fnot possible. No player in the world can come close to the\nstandards set by him. He also tries to advise his bowlers almost\nevery ball, with the result that the bowlers stop thinking on\ntheir own. I do not think his batting gets affected by captaincy.\nI feel he doesn't have the ambition to captain the team. I tried\nmy level best to convince him to remain as captain, but he\nwouldn't budge. He kept on saying that he wouldn't like to be\nthe captain again.\nAmazingly, there would be another dramatic twist to the tale.\nTendulkar was criticized for delaying his resignation till the day\nthe team was chosen with Azhar in it. The very next day, Azhar\nwithdrew from the first Test with an injury suffered in the Mumbai\ngame, when he was hit on the hand by Nantie Hayward. Inevitably,\nthis too was not clear-cut. Was his thumb fractured or was it a simple\ninjury? Now fingers were being pointed at Azhar. Was it a cop-out to\navoid a backlash over Tendulkar's resignation? He insisted the injury\nwas serious enough for him to miss the first Test, though it was also\nobvious he felt he was the victim of a conspiracy hatched by the\nincumbent to keep him out of the team.\nA survey of former players, including former captains Bishan Singh\nBedi, K.Srikkanth and Sunil Gavaskar found them backing\nTendulkar's decision. The onus for the resignation was placed firmly\non the Board, something Wadekar also agreed with. So what of the\nman in the middle himself?\nThis is what he had to say in Cricket Talk ( March ):\n\nQ: Why did you surrender the captaincy so suddenly?\nA: It had been building up gradually, the pressure to perform\nwell as well as win. We kept losing without competing hard\nenough and that hurt. Small, small things contributed till I\ndecided that it simply cannot go on like this. I was not enjoying\nthe game at all, so why carry the burden?\nQ: You had not been keen to accept the captaincy either. ..\nA: Yes, I did not want it. When Ajit Wadekar came to my house\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fat the start of the season last year, I told him that I was not\ninterested in the job. He was supposed to inform the other\nselectors but I don't know what happened and I was asked to\nlead ...\nQ: Does this mean that you were always plagued by doubt?\nThen why did you agree in the first place?\nA: I was in two minds initially, but then I thought to myself,\nwhy not give it another try. The dream was to win overseas and\nI chased it. I tried my level best but it did not work out.\nQ: Does the sudden decision to resign have something to do\nwith Mohammad Azharuddin's return to the team?\nA: Look, I have no problems with Azhar. I have not quit because\nhe is in the team. I have played for more than  years and am\nnot given to whim. I spent a lot of time thinking about this\n[Azhar's exclusion] when I was made captain last year. At that\ntime it seemed reasonable. But I'm of the firm belief that if\nanybody is good and he has the form to prove it, he should be in\nthe team. The relationship between Azhar and me is as it was\nall the time. It was needlessly blown into a controversy and\nblown out of all proportion.\nInterviewed by the same magazine ( September ), this is\nwhat he said on his differences with the selectors: 'Yes, my views differed\nwith the members of the earlier selection committee. I suppose this\nled to a degree of disillusionment and loss of interest in the job. After\nall, I was leading on the field. But now that is all in the past, so why\nrake it up?'\nThe two Tests against South Africa were a disaster for India. They\nlost the first at Mumbai by four wickets and the second at Bangalore\nby an innings and  runs. That was the end ofTendulkar's second\nstint as captain.\nTendulkar was the only batsman to look comfortable on a bowlerfriendly wicket at Mumbai. His  in the first innings was the highest\nscore in the match by far. There was only one other half-centuryexactly  by opener Gary Kirsten. The Indian captain also picked up\nStepping Down\n\n\n\n\fhis best Test bowling analysis of  for  from five overs as South\nMrica collapsed for  and conceded a lead of . He accounted for\nKirsten and fellow opener Herschelle Gibbs as well as Shaun Pollock\nwith a mixture of off and leg spin. The performance made him the\nMan of the Match. But it was South Mrica who held their nerve at the\nend.\nThe first Test was over in three days; the second just about dragged\ninto the fifth. Azhar was back and hit the only century of the series, his\ntwenty-second in his ninety-ninth Test. It was also destined to be his\nlast. At the end of the year the BCCI would impose a life ban on him.\nThe defeat meant Tendulkar had lost five Tests in a row as captain.\nIt was shattering for such a proud man and Indian cricket was at one of\nits lowest ebbs. His record as captain was poor-four Tests won, \ndrawn and nine lost. In the second stint, it stood at --. At virtually\nthe same time, in the West Indies, Brian Lara stepped down from the\ncaptaincy with a similar record of six won, two drawn and ten lost.\nGanguly took over for the one-day series which India won -.\nBut a few months later would come the revelations by the Delhi Police.\nSouth African captain Hansie Cronje, faced with the irrefutable\nevidence of taped phone calls, would eventually admit his guilt and\nthe world of cricket was thrown into its gravest crisis.\nWhat emerged was that Cronje and his teammates were busy\nhobnobbing with bookies throughout the short tour. Certainly, the\nverdict in the one-day series would be forever tainted. India had not\nbeen beaten in a Test series at home since losing - to Pakistan in\n. Cronje was the man to emulate the great Imran Khan. What an\nirony then, that he should find himself exiled from the world of cricket.\nMter failing in the first three oms, Tendulkar came good with his\ntwenty-fifth ton at Baroda as India won by four wickets to take an\nunbeatable -lead in the series. He followed it up with  in the fifth\nand final match at N agpur. The next few months would see a familiar\nwhirl of one-day tournaments around the globe-Sharjah (twice),\nNairobi and Dhaka. South Mrica and India were joined by Pakistan\nin Sharjah for the Coca-Cola Cup. India recorded a rare win over\nPakistan in the first round but lost the second match, as well as both\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fmatches against South Africa, and without a single major contribution\nfrom its top batsman, failed to make it to the final.\nThe Pepsi Asia Cup at Dhaka, a few months later, seemed likely to be\na total washout with torrential storms lashing the city. June, after all, is\nhardly the ideal month to play cricket in Bangladesh.\nThe run-up on the Indian side could not have been worse. On the\nnight before the team's departure, coach Kapil Dev called a press\nconference in New Delhi at which he launched an extraordinary attack\non Manoj Prabhakar. This followed Prabhakar naming Kapil as the\nman who, he claimed, had offered him a bribe to throw a match in Sri\nLanka in .\nKapil called on the Board to withdraw the team, considering its\nshattered morale. But the players did arrive in Dhaka, though a more\ndispirited side I have rarely seen. They just did not seem to have their\nheart in the game, and it showed in their performance on the field.\nAfter an unimpressive win over Bangladesh, India succumbed to both\nPakistan and Sri Lanka and failed to make the final. Tendulkar's \nagainst Sri Lanka was made out of a total of, chasing a target of\n.\nConsidering their poor one-day form, the Indians turned out to be\nthe surprise package of the second ICC knockout mini-World Cup in\nNairobi. Once Kenya were brushed aside, India were up against\nAustralia in the first quarter-final. In a stunning upset, the world\nchampions were tumbled out, beaten by  runs. Young guns Yuvraj\nSingh and Zaheer Khan were the batting and bowling heroes. Ganguly\nand Tendulkar gave the innings a flying start with a rapid stand of \nruns. Tendulkar () decided to take on McGrath and not only with\nhis bat. He hammered the world's leading fast bowler, prompting a\nfrustrated McGrath to unleash his usual string of abuse. He even\noffensively demonstrated to Tendulkar how to play a stroke.\nMcGrath and Brett Lee had over the past two days been talking of\nhaving a plan ready for Tendulkar, with the former saying that his\ngoal was to remove the openers in the first over. In Australia they had\nbeen able to dictate terms, with Tendulkar on the defensive. It was\nStepping Down\n\n\n\n\fdifferent this time. In McGrath's first over Tendulkar tried to take one\nfrom outside off and hit over mid wicket. The ball flared off the bat and\nsoared with immense power over a stunned Gillespie at third man, for\nan amazing six. The furious bowler could be seen mouthing something\nto his opponent.\nIn the next over Sachin danced down the wicket as if he were\nfacing an innocuous off-spinner, picked McGrath on the rise, and\nsmashed him over long off for six. On the next ball, back he came\ndown the track for another smashing drive on the up through midoff As McGrath stopped in his tracks, Tendulkar took a few steps\nforward, and very clearly stared at McGrath and said, 'Just fuck off!'\nMcGrath cupped his hands to his ears, perhaps not able to believe\nwhat he had just heard. There was one more six off McGrath before\nLee sent Sachin back.\nIt was for only the second time in his career that Sachin had lost\nhis cool on the field. It was a real shock for the Aussies, and the bowler\nin particular, who had targeted Tendulkar on their own soil just a few\nmonths before, in a strategy Steve Waugh liked to refer to ingenuously\nas 'mental disintegration'.\nIt backfired on them this time and India were in the final after\nanother shock defeat of South Africa in the semis. Tt'ndulkar was\nasked by the Sportstar ( February ) about that confrontation.\n\nQ: What is it that fires you? That charge you gave Glenn\nMcGrath at Nairobi. It was a very different Tendulkar we saw\nthat day ...\nA: That particular innings, I felt the wicket had a lot ofbounce\nand dampness. Ifl had not adopted an aggressive approach it\nwould have been a different story. That innings I think I took\nthem by surprise. They didn't expect me to do that at all. This\nwill tell you about how the pitch was. McGrath didn't have a\nmid-on to start with. He had a square-leg, a fine-leg, mid-off,\npoint, three slips and a gully. It reflects on the state of the pitch\nfor a one-day game. If I had tried to hang around he would\nhave attacked at the same spot and I didn't want them to be at\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe top. Counter-attack was the best thing. Scoring runs was\nimportant and not killing time on that pitch.\nThe opening pair again put on  in the semi-finals. This time\nGanguly carried his bat for  while Tendulkar's contribution was\n. The final turned out to be an anticlimax for the rampaging Indians.\nThey were beaten in the last over by dark horses New Zealand, with\nChris Cairns not out on . This overshadowed another century\nfrom the Indian captain and an opening stand worth . Tendulkar\nwas run out after a mix-up, for . Itwas a sad end to what had been an\noutstanding tournament for the young team.\nJust five days later, India and Sri Lanka were playing the opening\nmatch of the Coca-Cola tri-series (with Zimbabwe) in Sharjah and\nTendulkar was back in century mode. It was his sixth century in\nSharjah where he had already scored over  runs. But this one\nagainst the Sri Lankans was no slam-bang affair. His twenty-sixth ton\n() consisted ofjust six twos, three fours and a six.  runs came\nfrom singles this time, as the rest of the batting crumbled around him.\nHe was out only in the forty-seventh over, once again the victim of a\nrun-out.\nThe track at Sharjah had recently been relaid and was not the\nbatting-friendly wicket it used to be. It was very slow, with the ball not\ncoming on to the bat. So, Sachin was forced to change his style,\nworking the ball around the field, nudging behind square and\ndropping the ball short of fielders, and scampering for singles. He\nwon the Man of the Match award once again, but it was the Sri Lankans\nwho came out on top by five wickets. Sri Lanka won the return match\nas well, and then crushed India in the final. Followingjayasuriya's\nhuge , the Indian batting crashed to their lowest total of  all out.\nThe euphoria of Nairobi was suddenly forgotten.\n\nStepping Down\n\n \nMatch-fixing and the CBI\n\nI do not know a thing.-Sachin Tendulkar\n\nTendulkar's stand on the match-fixing controversy and the subsequent\nCBI probe and report has been consistent from the start. He has\nsteadfastly maintained that he was unaware of anything unsavoury\nwithin the team before, during, or after he was captain. It is a line that\none finds increasingly hard to accept.\nThe question then arises: as the leading player in the side and\nindeed in the world, could he not have taken a moral stand on the\nissue as did Pakistan's Rashid Latif? This is a question that Sachin and\nSachin alone can answer. So far, he has not been very forthcoming on\nthe matter, except to consistently stress not only his innocence, but\nalso his ignorance. But then, as we have seen before, he has never been\none to rock the boat. In an interview to Cricket Talk ( September\n), he declared, 'I have said it before and I am saying it again. I do\nnot know a thing. No one has approached me about any such thing. I\ndon't think they will dare.' In the same interview, he urged, 'Find the\nguilty and make examples of them. The game is too great for it to be\ndisgraced in this way.' This was shortly before the release of the CBI\nreport on match-fixing. 'I did not think this would happen to the\ngame. I thought that it was impossible. In fact, such a thought never\ncrossed my mind because it is something no cricketer should even\ncontemplate,' he added.\nIn interviews, Tendulkar has always claimed he did not have an\naxe to grind with Azharuddin. In private, it was a different matter. The\ntwo enjoyed a good rapport till the game of musical chairs for the\n\n\fcaptain's seat began to put a strain on their relationship. More than\nthat, Tendulkar always felt that Azhar did not perform as well under\nhis captaincy as he had done under Azhar's. Things came to a head in\nSharjah in December  when Azhar's batting methods and running\nbetween the wickets came under the microscope. That Tendulkar was\nsacked from the captaincy and Azhar restored to the position shortly\nafterwards is just another bitterly ironic chapter in the history oflndian\ncricket. As we saw in the last chapter, Sachin resigned his second term\nas captain when Azhar was brought back for the home series against\nSouth Africa in March . It was obviously the last straw. However,\nin one of his last interviews as captain, he reiterated that there was no\nissue between him and Azharuddin. If someone was performing well\nand could win games for the country, how could he have a problem?\nHe had not had a serious disagreement with any player for the past \nyears. Mter losing his captaincy he had played under Azhar and then\nAzhar had played under him, and there had never been a problemor so he said.\nThe closest he came to admitting to a rift was when he was asked\nby V Srivatsa of the Timescflndia ( July ): 'How do you find him\n[Azhar] as a man and what are your feelings after what's happened to\nhim? [the match-fixing ban]. Tendulkar replied, 'It's a very touchy\ntopic and I wouldn't like to go into it.'\nThe first journalist to openly write about the murky activities of\nbookies and the speculation of match-fixing was Pradeep Magazine,\ncurrently sports editor of the Hindustan Times. Magazine was sports\neditor of the Pioneer in , and was covering the tour of the West\nIndies when he broke the story about being approached by a bookie\nfrom Delhi who offered him large sums of money. In return, he was\nasked to introduce the bookie to key players in the side, including\ncaptain Tendulkar.\nMagazine recounted the encounter and its aftermath in his book\nNot Quite Cricket. There have been many books on the subject since,\nbut his was the very first. He met Tendulkar for an interview in\nGeorgetown, Guyana, at the end of which he asked the captain for his\nreaction to the bookie's offer. Magazine quotes Tendulkar:\nMatch-fixing and the CBI\n\n\n\n\fLook, I am earning crores of rupees from the game, from\nadvertising, only to steel myself against these temptations so\nthat at the end of the day I can look people in the eye with a\nclear conscience. And playing for the country is so important\nfor me that I can't even dream of doing such a thing. Neither\ncan anyone have the courage to approach me with an offer like\nthis. Ifhe did so the next moment he would find himself in jail.\nHe added: 'Even I have been hearing a lot of things about this\nwhole affair. I don't know what to do. Ifl were you I wouldn't do the\nstory but would tell the police about the man. Tell them to tap the\nman's phone and let us see who he talks to.'\nMagazine wrote that he was 'impressed by Sachin's presence of\nmind, his ability to see things in perspective .... Above all, one thing\nwas becoming increasingly clear to me: the rumours of betting and\nplayers taking money was not limited to journalistic circles alone;\neven the team management in the West Indies had heard about it and\nwere quite concerned.'\nThe team management included coach Madan La! who too had\nadvised Magazine against writing the article about his bookie\nencounter. The headline for Magazine's report splashed across the\nfront page of the newspaper was: 'I Was Offered Rs  Lakh by a\nBookie to\" fix\" a Match'.\nAs often happens in the media world, the heading did not quite\nreflect the contents. He had been offered the money for introductions\nto key players, not to 'fix' a match. The 'I' in the headline had an\nunfortunate fallout. While the BCCI brushed aside the story in public,\nunknown to Magazine himself, a letter was faxed to Tendulkar midway\nthrough the West Indies tour, asking him who the bookie was who\nhad offered him the money! A complete misinterpretation of the report.\nTendulkar confronted Magazine with this revelation at the nets\nbefore the Independence Cup match in Chennai against Pakistan in\nMay .\nHis voice [Tendulkar's] was a mixture ofanger and hurt. 'What\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fhave you written? You have written that I was offered money?'\nI looked him straight in the eye and replied: 'Who told you\nthat? I wrote exactly what I had told you. Didn't you read the\nstory?' It took only these few words from me for Tendulkar to\ncalm down. 'The Board had taken the \"I\" in your story to be me\n[Tendulkar] ,' he said. I explained to him that it was quite the\nreverse, the 'I' referred to me, not him.\n'How can they interpret it like that?' I exclaimed. 'I have\nreferred to you only in the end, that too quoting you as saying\n\"it is beneath my dignity to talk about such things.\"'\nMter the match was over, it was agreed between Tendulkar, Madan\nLal and Magazine that the journalist would write a letter to the Board,\nclarifying the matter. In his letter Magazine wrote: 'I fail to understand\nhow Tendulkar's name was linked with the bookie when my story\nwas clear and at no stage did it even hint that the bookie had met\nTendulkar.' He added something to the effect that Tendulkar was not\nonly a great player but also a great ambassador for the country and\nshould be left alone to concentrate on his game.\n'After a week or so,' says Magazine, 'I got a reply from the Board\nthat upset me even more. While thanking me for \"clarifying\" the\nsituation, it read: \"Now that you have denied your story, it would have\nbeen in the fitness of things if you had also named the bookie whom\nyou had met.\"'\nMagazine wrote that he was reminded of what Madan Lal had told\nhim in the West Indies. 'The only possibility of the truth coming out\nis when a player gets up and says that his teammates have taken money.\nTill that happens there is no point in pursuing this story.'\nThe establishment's duplicity was becoming clear. Worried perhaps\nthat skeletons from its own closet would come tumbling out under\nthe scrutiny of an investigation, everybody acted as if the crisis did not\nexist. The shabby cover-up of the Chandrachud Commission\nfollowed. This, and the public outcry over the next couple of years,\nand then the Delhi Police tapes implicating Hansie Cronje, made the\ngovernment call in the CBI to institute its own independent probe, the\nMatch-fixing and the CBI\n\n\n\n\freport of which was released in October .\nOutlook weekly picked up the threads of the story from Magazine\nin , and then in  came the tehelka.com videos clandestinely\nrecorded by Manoj Prabhakar.\nThese tapes achieved precious little, apart from revealing the\nbackbiting and gossip prevalent among India's cricketing fraternity.\nBut two points concerning Tendulkar stood out: firstly, Prabhakar\nrefused to trap Tendulkar on video despite pressure from those at the\nweb site; he said he had too much respect for him. Secondly, amidst all\nthe tawdry talk-much of it influenced by liberal doses of alcoholnot one person pointed a finger at Tendulkar or was critical ufhim in\nany form.\nPrabhakar had resigned in a huff after the  World Cup, and\nwas seen to have too many axes to grind. The main target of his\ncampaign was Kapil Dev. Further, Prabhakar allowed himself to\nbecome a pawn in the hands of certain sections of the media, who\ncynically manipulated him for their own benefit. His words thus\nlacked credibility, and ultimately he would be hoist by his own petard.\nThe CBI probe uncovered his own role in match-fixing and the Board\nbanned him from cricket for five years, acting on the report. The ban\nwas, of course, only symbolic, since he had retired by then.\nThere remained the question mark over Tendulkar's decision to\nnot enforce a follow-on in the third Test against New Zealand at\nAhmedabad. The CBI probed coach Kapil Dev's role in it and both the\ncaptain and the coach were questioned. The summer of  saw\njournalists camping outside the CBI headquarters in central Delhi.\nOne after the other, the who's who oflndian cricket were called to the\ncapital and questioned by India's premier investigating agency. The\nmedia scrimmage was getting increasingly chaotic as television\ncameras and reporters with their mikes jostled with print journalists\nto get quotes from Azharuddin, Mongia, Wadekar, Kapil Dev,\nPrabhakar and other past and present players and administrators. Most\nkept their lips sealed.\nTendulkar was spared the ordeal. He was questioned at home in\nMumbai. The stampede outside the CBI office ifhe had been called to\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fDelhi would have been unmanageable.\nThe CBI report did not indict either the captain or the coach over\nthe Ahmedabad match,\u2022though there were certain intriguing questions\nthat appeared to haye been left unanswered. The matter was finally\nclosed in late  with the CBI issuing a brief press release that it had\nfound no evidence of wrongdoing.\nMter the report came out in October, BCCI president A.C.Muthiah\ndecided to constitute the Board's own one-man commission in the\nform of former CBI Joint Director, K.Madhavan. Madhavan also probed\nthe matter, and spoke to Tcndulkar and Kapil Devin July . He\ntoo came to the same conclusion. It would be relevant here to quote\npassages from the em report directly concerning Tendulkar, which\nwas released to the media on  November . (The italics are mine.)\nBookie Pawan Puri's testimony (pages -):\nOnce there was a party at his friend Dimpy's house on ..\nto which both he and (fellow-bookie) Rattan Mehta were also\ninvited. Around  p.m. on that day he (Puri) picked up Rattan\nMehta from his house in Panchsheel Enclave (in New Delhi)\nto go to Dimpy's house which is at Sainik Farms. On the way,\nRattan Mehta asked him to ring up Shobhan Mehta, a Bombay\nbookie, and asked him to place a bet to the effect that the ongoing\nmatch between India-New Zealand at Ahmedabad would end\nin a draw. He was surprised as to how Rattan Mehta could\nanticipate this since New Zealand were in a precarious position\non . .  and very few persons would have anticipated that\nthe match would end in a draw. He dialed Shobhan's number\nand placed a bet to this effect. Even Shobhan Mehta was skeptical\nand since he was quite close to him, advised him not to place\nthis bet. However, he told Shobhan that he was placing bets on\nsomebody else's behalf. On being asked as to why Rattan placed\nbets with Shobhan through him and not directly, he stated that\nRattan does not have an account with Shobhan and hence he\nhad to place this bet through him. At Dimpy's place, Rattan\nMehta, after getting drunk, boasted that he had exact\nMatch-fixing and the CBI\n\n\n\n\finformation about the outcome of the Ahmedabad Test match\nand also placed bets with some other bookies, whose names he\ndid not remember.\n(The scores on  October, the third day cf the Test, was India  for \n\nwickets declared in the first innings and New Zealand  for  in reply. The\nmatch did, if course, end in a draw.)\nDr Ali Irani (pages -):\nDr Irani stated that he had never heard anything adverse\nregarding Tendulkar. In fact, in most of the matches where\nfixing was taking place, the clue was that the game would be\n'on' only when Tendulkar got 'out' because he was one player\nwho could single-handedly win the match and upset any\ncalculation.\n(This was later quoted by English journalist Scyld Berry in his prifrle cf\nTendulkarfor Wisden.com, callinR it the .'finest compliment' accorded to him.)\nKapil Dev (pages -):\nAbout the India-New Zealand Test at Ahmedabad in \nwhere India did not enforce the follow-on, he stated that this\ndecision was taken in consultation with the captain, vice captain\nand other senior players.\nOne day prior to the decision, there was absolutely no doubt\nin his mind that the follow-on should be enforced. At the end\nof play on the third day, there was no team meeting on the\nstrategy for the next day. Somewhere during lunchtime on the\nfourth day the bowlers, especially Srinath, complained that they\nwere very tired and India should bat again and score quick runs\nand make New Zealand bat thereafter.\nOn being told that the bookies in Delhi allegedly knew about\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fthe decision not to enforce follow-on on . .  night, Kapil\nstated that no decision to this effect was taken on the st and\nhence it was very surprising. On being asked whether somebody\ncould have subconsciously influenced this decision on the next\nday, he stated that it could not be ruled out. He could not\nremember as to who could have done it.\nAnalysis of evidence (pages - ):\nWith regard to the  Ahmedabad Test against New Zealand,\nSachin Tendulkar has stated that the decision not to enforce\nthe follow-on was collective, influenced by the fact that bowlers,\nespecially Srinath, had expressed that they were too tired. Kapil\nDev has corroborated this version. Moreover, both of them\nhave stated that the decision was arrived at during lunch on the\nth day. There is no evidence that Kapil Dev had passed on any\ninformation to the betting syndicate about this match.\nSachin Tendulkar (pages ---):\nSachin Tendulkar, former Indian captain, when asked about\nthe India-New Zealand Test at Ahmedabad in , stated that\nby the end of third day's play when New Zealand had lost\naround  wickets, he had thought to himself that he would\nenforce the follow-on the next day.\nHowever, the New Zealand innings dragged on till after lunch\nthe next day and by then he himself, coach Kapil Dev, Ani!\nKumble and Ajay Jadeja decided that the follow-on would not\nbe enforced since the bowlers, especially Srinath had insisted\nthat they were very tired.\nIt was a collective decision not to enforce the follow-on. (There\nwas speculation in the media that he was here trying to protect\nthe coach.) On being asked whether anybody could have\ninfluenced this decision since the bookies in Delhi allegedly\nknew one day in advance that the follow-on would not be\nenforced, he accepted that it was possible.\nMatch-fixing and the CBI\n\n\n\n\fAbout Shobhan Mehta, the Mumbai bookie, he stated that he\nhad never met this person nor did he invite him to his wedding.\nDuring his wedding there was tight security and only select\npersons were invited and nobody without a proper invitation\ncould have gatecrashed.\nAll speculations about himself and Shobhan Mehta were\nabsolutely rubbish and he had never met this person any time\nin his life. On being asked whether he suspected any Indian\nplayer of being involved in match-fixing, Sachin stated that\nduring his tenure as captain, he had felt that Mohammad\nAzharuddin was not putting in  per cent effort and he\nsuspected that he was involved with some bookies.\nOn being asked about the India-West Indies match at Kanpur\nin  when Manoj Prabhakar and Nayan Mongia batted\nslowly, he stated that he was the vice captain during that match\nand he was absolutely sure that there were no instructions from\nthe management for Manoj Prabhakar and Nayan Mongia to\nbat slowly and that he was so upset with their tactics that he did\nnot talk to them after the match.\nAt the end of it all, Ajay Sharma and Azharuddin were banned\nfrom cricket for life by the BCCI while Manoj Prabhakar, Ali Irani and\nAjay Jadeja got five-year suspensions.\nIronically, while Kapil Dev was let off (he later resigned as coach of\nthe national side), it was his accuser Prabhakar who found himself\nbriefly behind bars, for his alleged role in a chit fund scam.\nBy July , the dust had settled on the controversy, but Tendulkar\ncontinued to be guarded in his response.\nAsked by V Srivatsa (Times cflndia,  July ), 'Did you ever\nsuspect such things were happening right under your nose?' his answer\nwas: 'It's very hard to comment on it. I treated whatever has happened\nas one of those bad phases and happily it's past. I do get this feeling that\npeople have forgotten all that, they look at this team from a different\nangle altogether, that's very important to all of us.'\nHow did the team take it?,' asked Srivatsa.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fTendulkar replied, 'The whole team was shocked because none\nof us could ever think of it.'\n\nMatch-fixing and the CBI\n\n Foreign Travails\n\nTime may have changed my game a little bit, here and there.\n-Sachin Tendulkar on the eve of his th Test match.\nIf, as we have seen in Chapter ,  was a year of controversies,\n was the first year in which Sachin Tendulkar would see his preeminence in the Indian team finally overtaken after nearly a decade as\nthe nation's numero uno.\nThe first Test of for the Indian team however did not give any\nsuch indications as Zimbabwe were trounced by an innings and \nruns at N agpur with Tendulkar being one of three Indian centurions,\nscoring .\nThis however was a different Tendulkar on display. The Indian\npublic had got the first indications of another side to his attacking\nstrokeplay in the earlier home series against England. But that could\nbe largely put down to the negative antics of the English bowlers and\ncaptain.\nZimbabwe were a different matter altogether and to see Tendulkar\ngo through a period of  minutes after tea on the third day without\nscoring a run was indeed a revelation to one and all. Still, the th ton\nwas in the bag.\nFurther vulnerabilities were revealed in the second Test at New\nDelhi and this time tongues began to wag.\nJust as England's Ashley Giles had tied him down a few months\nearlier, this time it was the turn ofanother left-arm spinner, Ray Price.\nSuddenly analysts were telling us that Tendulkar's weakness was\nagainst this type ofbowler.\n\n\fIt all came down to the final day of the Delhi Test with India\nneeding  runs to win with seven wickets in hand and Virender\nSehwag out with a shoulder injury. But Tendulkar was at the crease.\nIn the first innings Price had bowled  balls to Tendulkar,\nconceding only eight runs and finally getting him lbw for laborious\nruns.\nNow Tendulkar dodged Price for  straight overs with Shiv\nSunder Das farming the strike. But Price had his man, once again lbw\n(for ) from the fourth ball he bowled to him and now panic stations\nset in. It took some wild shots from Harbhajan Singh of all people to\nseal the issue.\nTendulkar missed the One-day series that followed with a hand\ninjury and then it was time to head to the Caribbean, only his second\ntour there.\nIn  under his captaincy India were beaten - and the captain\nhimself had failed to record a century. This time around there would\nbe just one.\nThings started well enough with  in the drawn first Test at\nGeorgetown, Guyana. This time he allowed leg-spinner Mahendra\nNagamootoo to get the better ofhim, falling to a spinner for the sixth\ninnings in a row after eking out five runs from the  balls he faced.\nDon Bradman's  centuries was equalled in the next Test at Portof-Spain, Trinidad, and now only Sunil Gavaskar with  stood before\nhim.\nThis was also the only venue where India had won a Test in the\nCaribbean, both in  and . Now they would make ita third.\nIt was by the narrow margin of runs and never easy Epitomizing\nthe struggle was Tendulkar himself whose century was arguably the\npatchiest of his entire career. It was not pretty but it had done the job.\nTendulkar had fallen for a duck in the second innings and he made\nit two out of two in the next Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, which India\nlost by  wickets.\nThe second innings produced just eight and now in his lone\ninnings ih the fourth Test at St. John's, Antigua, there was another\nduck, this time first ball to Pedro Collins. It meant he had failed to get\n\n\nSachin\n\n\foff the mark in three ofhis last four innings which had produced a\ntotal ofjust eight runs.\nThat horror run ended in the fourth and final Test at Kingston,\nJamaica with scores of  and . That could not prevent another\ndefeat and it meant India had lost a series they should have won, just\nas in .\nThere was some consolation in the one-day series, India winning\n-, the first time they had done so in the West Indies.\nThe first two games at Kingston were washed out. Then in the\nthird at Bridgetown, they won a game (of any sort) for the first time at\nthis venue with Tendulkar on  not out in the unusual batting position\nof number four. A painful shoulder meant he had to miss the next\nmatch at Port-of-Spain where the Windies levelled the series and now\nit was all to play for in the decider at the same ground.\nTendulkar played through the pain to top score with  and also\npicked up the wicket of Brian Lara. It was enough to gain him the\nMan of the Series award and a precious triumph at the end of what\nhad been a bitterly disappointing Test series.\nIndia had last won a Test series outside of Asia in England in R.\nThis time round the Test series in England would be drawn -. But\nbefore that came a remarkable victory in the Nat-West tri-series also\ninvolving Sri Lanka.\nIndia overtook England's  for  to record the highest successful\nrun-chase in ODI history in the final at Lord's and once again Tendulkar\nhad failed in a big match with .\nThe knives were out for him but the wielders failed to take into\naccount his pile of runs in the preliminary games, including two\ncenturies without which India would have struggled to reach the\nfinal in the first place.\nIt would have been fitting if the landmark of his OOth Test matchthe fourth Indian after Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar and Kapil Dev to\nachieve this feat-had taken place at home, particularly at his beloved\nWankhede Stadium in Murnbai. But it was not to be and the venue\ninstead was the Oval where the fourth and final Test in September\nended in a draw.\nForeign Travels\n\n\n\n\fMter being trounced in the first Test at Lord's, India came back\nstrongly to crush England by an innings and  runs in the third at\nHeadingley.\nTendulkar had fallen short ofhis th century by just eight runs in\nthe previous drawn Test at Nottingham. Now at Headingley he\nreached the mark in style with an imposing .\nThe former captain added a record  for the fifth wicket with\ncurrent captain Ganguly after Dravid's . This included an\nastonishing  runs from  overs of the new ball as the light faded on\nthe second evening of the Test.\nWith the teams locked at - going into the decider, it would have\nbeen fitting ifTendulkar's th Test had been a memorable one. But\nit was not to be. Neither side wanted to take any chances and rain\nwashed out the entire final day. Tendulkar's  was flashy and stylish\nand helped him finish second in the averages to the awesome Dravid\nwho was now beginning to emerge as the best batsman in the Indian\nteam as well as one of the best in the world.\nWest Indies minus an injured Brian Lara visited India for three\nTests and seven oms. Injury kept Tendulkar out of the latter but in the\nTest series Indian fans were shown the new side of the master batsman\nin the third and final Test at Kolkata.\nIndia having wrapped up the series by winning the first two Tests,\nboth teams were playing only for pride at the Eden Gardens. It took a\nmatch-saving double century stand between Tendulkar () and\nWS La.xman ( not out) to salvage the match after India found\nthemselves struggling at  for  in the second innings, still trailing\nby  runs.\nTendulkar has rarely been a match-saver, more a match-winner\nwith his attacking batsmanship. Indeed it was way back in  with\nhis maiden Test century at Old Trafford that he had salvaged a draw\nfor his country.\nThis time he batted for seven hours and though he never looked\ntroubled, it was the sign of a more mature, experienced cricketer.\nThe tour to New Zealand late in  was an ill-advised one with\nthe Indian cricketers fatigued after a prolonged season.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fIt turned out to be a disaster, India being trounced in the two Test\nmatches as well as the seven oms, all played in freezing weather and\non sub-standard pitches. Only Vi render Sehwag managed to keep his\nreputation intact. Tendulkar missed the first four oms with a sprained\nankle. He managed just ,  and  in the next three.\nIt was the fourth such injury in the season, forcing him to miss\neven more one-day games, surely a sign that the wear-and-tear of\nyears of non-stop cricket had begun to take a heavy toll on his body.\nNow it was time for the World Cup again.\n\nForeign Travels\n\n The World Cup\n\nIt is an honour to be named the best player cif the l#lrld Cup, but I would\nhave been happier if India had won the title.-Sachin Tendulkar\nIndia had won the World Cup for the first and so far only time  years\nago in England.

It led his fans to ask for the SCG to be\nrenamed the Sachin Cricket Ground!\nUnbeaten on  when the innings ended, it meant he had now\ntallied  runs at the SCG since last being dismissed.\nThe tremendous warmth shown to Tendulkar by the crowd when\nhe got to his century was one of the few redeeming features of a Test\nthat brought little credit to the game.\nThe final day when Michael Clarke grabbed three wickets in the\ndying stages to give Australia their record-equalling th straight\nDrama Down Under and the\n\nIPL\n\n\n\n\fvictory was once again marked by atrocious umpiring. Plus a petulant\ndisplay by the home side that dismayed even their most ardent fans.\nThings had come to a head on the third day during the century\npartnership between Harbhajan and Tendulkar when Symonds\nclaimed the Indian off spinner had used a racial slur against him. The\nhearing called against Harbhajan by Procter on the insistence of\nPanting was deferred till the end of the match.\nIt was a marathon hearing with the Indians still smarting from the\numpiring and the shock defeat. And at the end of it all, the Match\nReferee slapped a ban of three Test matches on Harbhajan.\nIt turned out to be a case of Tendulkar's word against the\nAustralians' as the stump mikes had not picked up the exchange.\nProcter imposed the ban as he felt Tendulkar was not close enough to\nhear what was said between the two protagonists.\nThe Indians protested vehemently and went on appeal. As tempers\nrose over the punishment, there were rumours that the Indian board\nwould call off their tour. In a compromise move, it was decided to hear\nthe appeal at the end of the Test series. The ICC also caved in under\nIndian pressure and had Bucknor removed as umpire for the third\nTest.\nAll hell broke loose and the media and fans on both sides took\nextreme stands.\nThe BCCI's contention that Indians were incapable of racial abuse\nwas hard to swallow considering the nasty reception that Symonds\nhad received at the hands of the crowds when the Aussies had toured\nin late .\nThose ugly scenes had been captured on camera during the final\n at Mumbai and the Board was forced to take action against the\nerring spectators after first denying such incidents had occurred at\nearlier games.\nIt was during this Mumbai ODI that Symonds first alleged\nHarbhajan had called him a monkey, something the all-rounder found\noffensive considering he is the only non-white in the Australian team.\nUnder the ICC terms, it constituted racial abuse.\nPanting had wanted to press charges there and then but Symonds\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fdiffused the situation by conveying his feelings in person to Harbhajan\nin the Indian dressing room at the end of that particular match and\napparently getting an assurance that such language would not be\nrepeated. So there was a history between them. Former English\ncricketer and columnist Peter Roebuck went so far as to call for\nPanting's head over the behaviour of the team at Sydney. The\nAustralians were suitably chastened by the time of the third Test at\nPerth as a national outcry had erupted around them.\nThat did not prevent Panting from predicting a rout of the Indians\non the fiery surface of the WACA which had traditionally been a fast\nbowler's paradise and where Australia had not lost a Test since .\nBut in a dramatic turnaround, the Indians became the first team\nfrom Asia to win at the WACA and the Australians were left to lick their\nwounds.\nIt was also the first time since India had won the Adelaide Test in\nDecember  that any touring side had beaten the world champions\nat home, that too with a day to spare.\nIt meant that once again it was the Indians who had halted\nAustralia's run of straight wins just as they had in Kolkata in .\nThe pace bowlers did indeed dominate but it was the Indian attack\nofRudra Pratap Singh, Irfan Pathan and Ishant Sharma who stole a\nmarch over their more fancied Aussie counterparts.\nNo batsman reached three figures, with Dravid's  in the first\ninnings the highest individual score in the match.\nTendulkar was batting fluently when umpire Asad Rauf ruled him\nout lbw to Brett Lee for  with replays showing the ball would have\ngone over the stumps.\nAn upset Sachin walked off shaking his head, perhaps ruing the\nfact that he fell short of emulating the feat of scoring centuries at both\nSydney and Perth that he had achieved on his first tour in -.\nIndia could not regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which was in\nAustralia's possession, once they had lost the first two Test matches.\nBut the Perth victory nonetheless came as a huge morale booster for\nAni! Kumble and his men following the trauma and controversy of\nDrama Down Under and the IPL\n\n\n\n\fSydney.\nNothing though could deny Tendulkar in the fourth and final\nTest at Adelaide. His th century was a classic, his sixth in Australia\nand first at the SACA ground.\nThe high-scoring Test ended in a draw with Australia taking the\nseries -.\nA remarkable feature of the tour was the warmth with which\nTendulkar was welcomed at every venue across the country on what\nwas perhaps his final tour of Australia.\nAustralian journalist Greg Baum wrote in The Wisden Cricketer\n(UK, December ): 'Here is a man whose name is synonymous\nwith purity, of technique, philosophy and image. Iflan Botham was\nthe Errol Flynn of cricket, or Viv Richards the Martin Luther King, or\nShane Warne the Marilyn Monroe, or Muthiah Muralitharan the\nHobbit, Tendulkar is surely the game's secular saint.'\nTendulkar has always claimed Australia is his favourite country to\nplay in and the feeling is obviously mutual.\n'It's truly a special feeling to walk in to such a reception, when I\ndon't know ifl am batting on zero or on ,' was his response when\nhe was asked after his Adelaide century about the crowd's reception to\nhim both as he entered the ground and on reaching his hundred.\nWith the Test series over, it was now time for Harbhajan's appeal\nagainst his ban to be heard by New Zealand High Court judge justice\nJohn Hansen. The Indian camp had obviously done their homework\nand came up with what was accepted as a plausible defence of their\nbowler after which the ban was lifted. The circumstances round the\nhearing though left a bad taste in everyone's mouth and neither camp\nemerged with much credit. Hansen unlike Procter accepted from video\nevidence that Tendulkar was close enough to hear what had transpired.\nBack home in India SMS jokes were being exchanged by cricket\nfans that what Harbhajan had uttered was a common Punjabi gaali\n(abuse) which was misunderstood by Symonds. It was leftto the master\nbatsman to defend his friend and colleague and explain to the learned\njudge the meaning of the swear-word.\nThe Australian on-field witnesses were trumped as there was no\n\n\nSachin\n\n\frecording or hard evidence on their part to counter the Indians' line of\ndefence.\nHarbhajan earned a reprieve much to the relief of the Indians and\nCricket Australia who were sweating under a renewed threat from the\nBCCI to call off the rest of the tour.\nIt made him into perhaps the most hated visiting cricketer in\nAustralia since England captain Douglas Jardine of - Bodyline\ninfamy and he received a hostile reception from the crowds and media\nright through the remainder of the tour.\nIt also brought into the spotlight the close bond between the fiery\nbowler and the legendary batsman, an unusual friendship of opposites\nif ever there was one.\nAustralians were seething as Hansen himself admitted he would\nhave imposed a ban had he been provided with data showing\nHarbhajan's behavioural record.\nInexplicably, the Icc's 'human and database error'--euphemism\nfor a screw-up-meant Hansen was informed of only one such\nincident when in fact there had been a total offour instances ofpenalties\nimposed on Harbhajan for breaches of conduct over the span of his\n-year international career.\nInstead, all he earned was a slap on the wrist, forfeiting  per cent\nofhis match fees.\nSignificantly, Hansen made the point that it was Symonds who\nhad initiated the exchange, provoking the verbal abuse directed at\nhim. This set an important precedent as Australian cricketers had for\nsome years gotten offlightly for provoking such incidents, most notably\nthe Glenn McGrath-Ramnaresh Sarwan flare-up in St. John's,\nAntigua, in .\nIt was back to on-field action with India's campaign in the\nCommonwealth Bank om tri-series against the World Cup winners\nAustralia and runners-up Sri Lanka. India had not won the title on\nfive previous attempts and now it would be their last chance as it was\nthe final tri-series to be staged in Australia after  seasons.\nDhoni pulled off what Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Mohammad\nAzharuddin, Tendulkar and Ganguly had all tried but failed to\nDrama Down Under and the IPL\n\n\n\n\fachieve-he led India to victory over Australia in the finals.\nIt came down to the final league game against Lanka at Hobart and\nhere eventually Tendulkar came good with his first half-century of\nthe tournament. He had struggled in the previous seven matches and\nthe Indian camp was beginning to fret about his lack of runs. But this\ntime he kept his best for the last after failing for so many years to score\nbig in crunch games.\nThree times before had the Indians reached the tri-series finals,\neach time beaten by Australia. Now in the opening match at Sydney\nthey coasted home by six wickets with  balls to spare, led by an\nimperious unbeaten  from Tendulkar.\nIt was his first century in a final since  and his maiden ODI ton\non Australian soil in his th match, marking the first time India had\nbeaten the hosts at the sec in  matches.\nTendulkar's previous century was  matches back against the\nWest Indies at Vadodara in January . In between he had been\ndismissed in the s on six occasions including three times on .\nThe pressure had been building up but he could not have timed\nhis nd ton better. It was the perfect century in the perfect chase as\nthe Indians easily overhauled Australia's  for eight.\nTwo days later at Brisbane they wrapped up the title but it was\nmuch closer this time.\nTendulkar's  was another masterly innings but it all came down\nto the final over of the match bowled by Pathan. He picked up two\nwickets and the Indians were cock-a-hoop.\nMter an arduous and tension-ridden tour lasting nearly three\nmonths, the new captain and the veteran maestro had combined forces\nto achieve what Dhoni acclaimed was even bigger than the World\nTwenty victory.\n'Performance is one thing, but performing back-to-hack is\nsomething else. He is the best,' said the elated captain of his matchWinner.\nThe Indians were back home triumphant, but in the mad whirl of\ninternational cricket, they hardly had time for a break before the South\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fAfricans came visiting for three Test matches.\nIt was towards the end of the Australian tour that an event had\ntaken place in Mumbai which shook the world of cricket and made\nheadlines around the globe.\nThe BCCI's plans for the Indian Premier League Twenty\ntournament had been unveiled in  and now for the first time,\ncricketers found themselves auctioned off like cattle (in the words of\nAdam Gilchrist) for eye-popping prices amongst the eight franchise\nteams.\nDhoni fetched the highest price ofall, $. million for the Chennai\nSuper Kings.\nThe Mumbai Indians, owned by Mukesh Ambani, were among\nthe teams that had the option of an 'icon' player, naturally Tendulkar,\nwho would automatically fetch  per cent more than the highest bid\npla:yer.\nTendulkarwentfor $. million. Itwas the highest for any of the\nfive icon players, Rahul Dravid (Bangalore), Virender Sehwag (Delhi),\nGanguly (Kolkata) and Yuvraj Singh (Mohali) being the others.\nVVS.L:oonan had voluntarily shed his icon status in order to allow\nhis team (Deccan Chargers) to have more spending money.\nWith the massively hyped IPL round the corner, the Test series was\nrushed through with barely anyone seeming to bother. The whole of\nIndia, indeed the world, was counting down the days to the start of\ncricket's latest revolution.\nThe series was deadlocked - but what was significant was a groin\ninjury that kept Tendulkar out of the second and third Tests.\nHe batted in just one innings in the series and was out for a duck\neven as India piled up a mammoth  in the opening Test at Chennai,\nmarked by Sehwag's second Test triple century.\nTendulkar picked up the strain during the closing stages of the triseries in Australia and had been advised two weeks' rest. It was\naggravated at Chennai and now there was a cloud over his participation\nin the IPL.\nThe tournament got off to a spectacular start in Bangalore on April\n with New Zealand wicket-keeper Brendan McCullum smashing\nDrama Down Under and the\n\nIPL\n\n\n\n\fa record  not out from  balls for the Kolkata Knight Riders\nagainst the Bangalore Royal Challengers.\nHarbhajan was appointed captain of the Mumbai Indians in\nTendulkar's absence and was obviously uncomfortable in the role.\nThe concept of IPL was a new experience for the players and the big\nIndian names in particular felt under pressure playing for corporate\nbig-wigs with huge price tags on their heads rather than for regional\nor national teams.\nThings came to a head after Mumbai's third defeat in a row,\ncomprehensively beaten by Kings XI Punjab at Mohali.\nPunjab's provocative pace bowlerS. Sreesanth had been taunting\nthe Mumbai players throughout the match and at the end of it\nHarbhajan slapped his India team-mate who promptly shed a flood of\ntears.\nThe IPL came down heavily on him and Harbhajan was banned\nfor the rest of the tournament and lost his entire signing fee.\nWith Tendulkar still not fit, South Africa's Shaun Pollock took\nover and the change made all the difference as Mumbai came back\ninto the reckoning with three wins in the next four games.\nBut the pressure was mounting on Sachin to declare himself fit\nand make an appearance. He was one of the showpieces of the inaugural\nIPL season and it would have been unthinkable if he did not show up\nfor the grand party.\nFinally, after missing seven games, the suspense was over. He took\nover the captaincy for the match against leading contenders Chennai\nSuper Kings on his home turf at the Wankhede Stadium and the\nresults were spectacular.\nAfter Chennai had compiled  for , Sanath Jayasuriya-the\noldest player in the IPL-cut loose and even Tendulkar could only\nlook on with awe from the other end. The target was reached in .\novers with nine wickets in hand and the Lankan left-hander was\nunbeaten on -of which  came from boundaries. It was\nTwenty batting fireworks at its best. His opening stand with his\ncaptain was worth  from . overs but Tendulkar contributed just\n runs from  balls, and was bowled by Joginder Sharma.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fThe Mumbai crowd went berserk. Their hero was back and their\nteam had made it four wins in succession.\nNagging doubts remained though-had Tendulkar rushed his\nreturn? Was he fully fit?\nMumbai won their next two games as well and with six on the trot\nlooked certain to make the semi-finals. But a slump followed.\nThe first setback was defeat at the hands ofPunjab by just one run.\nTendulkar's contribution was  which turned out to be his only halfcentury of the tournament. Then came two more agonizingly close\nfinishes, losing with a ball to spare against Delhi and a last-ballloss at\nthe hands of Rajasthan which meant Mumbai had fallen just short of\nreaching the semi-finals.\nThe run of defeats brought out a side ofTendulkar his fans had\nnever witnessed before.\nThere had been some controversial run-out decisions by third\numpire Suresh Shastri in the loss to Punjab and for the first time in\nhis career, Tendulkar went public with his criticism.\nA standard 'no comment' would have been his usual answer to the\nvolley of questions. This time he responded. 'The whole world has\nwatched what it was all about,' he said. 'Everyone has seen what\nhappened and in whose favour the decisions eventually went. Had we\ngot those two run-out decisions our way, we would have added two\nmore runs to the tally and won the match.'\nThe frustration was building up and it exploded at the end of the\nmatch against Rajasthan inJaipur which sealed Mumbai's fate. The\ncaptain's contribution with the bat had been patchy at best with \nruns from seven matches at the average of.. He had been unable\nto bowl either due to his injury. And his captaincy was uninspiring.\nOne newspaper report, without specifically naming him, broadly\nhinted that Tendulkar had lashed out at the younger players in the\nteam at the end oftheJaipur defeat, much to their shock and dismay\nFor the senior Indian players, the IPL was a whole new world and\nmost of them came out of the first season with their reputations dented.\nPlayers were now accountable to their paymasters rather than to the\nfans alone and having to report to corporate bosses brought out pressures\nDrama Down Under and the IPL\n\n\n\n\fand fissures which would take some getting used to.

In the first\nmatch against lowly UAE he fell for  and then scored the same\nagainst Sri Lanka in the next game which India lost. However, he was\nback in form with  not out against Bangladesh and then  against\nPakistan, with India losing by  runs.

He stayed with the team for their washed out\nmatches but then when they travelled to England for the NatWest\nseries against England and the Champions Trophy, Tendulkar was\nforced to drop out and was replaced in the squad by Rohan Gavaskar.\nThe injury was eventually diagnosed as 'tennis elbow' which meant\nhe could not even pick up a cup of tea, let alone a bat, with his left hand\nand had to sit it out for close to three months. It is usually brought on\n\n\fby repetitive wrist and elbow motion resulting in tendon damage.\nIt was yet another forced break through injury, something that had\nplagued him since early  when his back spasms almost forced\nhim to miss the World Cup in England. In , it meant that he had\nto skip the Videocon Cup in the Netherlands, the NatWest Challenge\nand the Champions Trophy in England and half the home Test series\nagainst Australia.\nFrom  to , Tendulkar missed a total of  ODis and five\nTest matches. While India won . of the  ODis he played in (till\nthe end of), in his absence the winning percentage dropped to\n.. In Test matches, India also lost three, drew one and won one of\nthe five Tests during this same period.\nWith world champions Australia touring India in October, there\nwas intense speculation over Tendulkar's availability. But he was not\nfit for the first Test at Bangalore which India lost and the second at\nChennai which was drawn.\nHe made his comeback in the third Test at N agpur. It was however\na disappointing return. He could score only  and  as India were\nbeaten by  runs and thus lost a home series to Australia for the first\ntime since -.\nIndia though had the consolation of winning the fourth and final\nTest in Mumbai. On a sharply turning track where batsmen on both\nsides struggled, Tendulkar's  in the second innings and his stand of\n with VVS.

He could\nscore just  runs in seven innings since his return from injury till\nthe end of the South Mrican series.\nThe short tour to Bangladesh at the end of was an opportunity\nto cash in on some easy runs and wickets for the Indian team. This\nmay have tempted Tendulkar to make the tour despite not being fully\nfit.\nYear of Contrasts\n\n\n\n\fHe certainly cashed in. In his previous  years of Test cricket,\nTendulkar had only two double centuries to his credit. Now he started\nthe year  with  not out at Sydney, reached  not out before\nthe declaration at Multan and, in December, rounded it off with his\nhighest Test (and first-class) score to date,  not out in the first Test\nin Dhaka.\nIn between all those runs came his debilitating injury and a dip in\nform.\nThat massive Dhaka innings enabled him to draw level with Sunil\nGavaskar's world record mark of Test centuries.

Mter all, it was\nagainst Pakistan that he had made his Test debut in  and which\nbetter side to achieve the world record for most Test centuries than\nIndia's traditional rivals?\nIndia began the series as hot favourites having beaten Pakistan on\ntheir own soil the season before and it was at Mohali in the opening\nTest match in March  that Tendulkar fell short of the magical\nmark by just one scoring stroke.\nIt took a tremendous rearguard act by Pakistan's lower order\nbatsmen on the final day to save the Test after falling behind by \nruns in the first innings.\nIndia's massive first innings of  saw all the top six batsmen\nchipping in, with Virender Sehwag's  the standout innings.\nTendulkar played some glorious shots early in his knock before\nwithdrawing into his shell once he got into the s.\nA thick edge to gully saw him out for  in the last session of the\nthird day and the huge sigh of disappointm~nt around the ground\nmeant Mohali had missed out on their slice of cricket history. He did\nnot get a chance to bat the second time round.\nPakistan's great escape would haunt captain Sourav Ganguly later\nin the series, which turned out to be his final one in charge at home.\nIndia surged ahead after the second Test at Kolkata thanks to Ani I\nKumble's haul of  wickets and another awesome batting display.\n\n\fOnce again Tendulkar was eclipsed, this time by Rahul Dravid\nwho scored centuries in both innings. In a remarkable coincidence,\nTendulkar scored  in both the innings and India's total in each\ninnings was  (for nine wickets declared in the second). It was\nenough to win the Test comfortably by  runs.\nIf in the first innings he was out to a poor shot, in the second\nTendulkar fell to India's old bogeyman, umpire Steve Bucknor of\nJamaica who had created his own record by becoming the first umpire\nto stand in  Tests.\nHaving turned down an appeal for bad light minutes before,\nBucknor raised his finger to the astonishment of everyone at the\nground-including the Pakistanis-when he upheld a caught-behind\nappeal by bowler Abdul Razzaq. No one else in the field went up for\nthe catch and Tendulkar' sjaw dropped in shock. The distance between\nbat and ball was for all to see, except apparently the man who counts\nunder such circumstances.\nTendulkar had once again missed out on that th ton. But on the\nfirst day he became the fifth batsman to cross , runs and in\nexactly the same number of innings () as his great friend and rival,\nBrian Lara.\nInzamam-ul-Haq's side had been written offat the start of the tour\nas one of the weakest from Pakistan to visit India. But the end of the\nthird and final Test at Bangalore proved how wrong the critics were as\nIndia's inability to shut out the Mohali Test rebounded on them.\nYounis Khan's outstanding batting ( and  not out) was the\nfeature of this match as India's batting once again crumbled when\nchasing on the final day-a repeated failing both on the part of the\nteam and the individual (Tendulkar) over the last decade.\nSehwag responded with a double century of his own but India\nconceded over  runs on the first innings and the target of runs\nwas well beyond them.\nBy lunch on the fifth and final day; a draw seemed the most plausible\noutcome with India having lost just the wicket ofSehwag through a\nrun out.\nBut now shockingly the entire batting line up retreated into their\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fshells and the ultra-defensive tactics allowed Pakistan's bowlers to\nthrottle them to defeat. The last nine wickets crumbled for the addition\nof only  runs.\nIt was Tendulkar's inertia at the crease that was a major factor in\nthe collapse and the last Indian wicket fell with just a handful of overs\nleft in the match.\nMter striking a rapid  in the first innings, Tendulkar, the second\ntime around, scratched about for  balls and  minutes before he\nsuccumbed meekly to the part-time spin of Shahid Mridi for a\nmiserable  runs.\nIndia surrendered by  runs and a jubilant Pakistan side could\nscarcely believe this dramatic tum in fortunes. Though the series\nended -, the visitors were certainly the moral victors and a deflated\nIndian side went into the one-day series with their spirits crushed.\nThat was not immediately evident as they romped home in the\nfirst and second ODis at Kochi and Visakhapatnam and looked to have\ntaken a firm grip on the series.\nIncredibly, Pakistan stormed back to win the next four in a row and\ngrab the series -.\nTendulkar made a total of runs in six innings. But  of those\nwere scored in the fourth game at Ahmedabad. The rest ofhis scores\nmade sad reading--, , ,  and .\nHis previous  century had also been against Pakistan at\nRawalpindi  months earlier and in between there had been \ninnings, in which his highest score was  not out.\nBut as at Rawalpindi (where Pakistan won by  runs), at\nAhmedabad too his century was not enough.\nIndia scored  for  and Pakistan scrambled home by three\nwickets from the final delivery of the match bowled by Tendulkar\nwith the scores level, which lnzamam calmly struck for a boundary.\nThe Pakistan captain took the Man of the Match award for his\nunbeaten  despite Tendulkar's ton (his th) and his bowling which\nfetched him the wicket of Abdul Razzaq.

Tendulkar was still\nrecovering from surgery and was no doubt grateful that he was not\naround when the storm broke. Though India, expectedly, swept the\nTest series, they were once again beaten in the final of the tri-series,\nthis time at the hands of the Kiwis.\nThe Sri Lankans were back in town in October for seven oms,\nfollowed by four against South Mrica after which the Lankans would\nreturn for three Tests. And by now, Dravid had been formally appointed\nas captain.\nMter missing six months (and eight days, to be precise) of cricketincluding the ill-fated ICC 'Super Series' in Australia-Tendulkar was\ndeclared fit and found the spotlight trained unerringly on himself\nonce agam.\nDuring this period he had expressed his frustrations in an interview\nat not being able to lift a bat during his rehabilitation period. 'Would\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fhe be able to regain his batting touch after another injury layoff?' was\nthe question on everyone's lips.\nThe answer could not have been more emphatic.

And though his scores dipped after that, India were\nunstoppable and ran out convincing winners at -.\n'Tendulkar is still the very best in the business,' proclaimed former\nLanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga after watching him at Nagpur.\nThere was another slump in the four games against the South\nAfricans where he totalled just  runs. But now it was back to the\nbusiness ofTest cricket against Lanka.\nThe first Test at Chennai was a near-washout but there was a packed\nhouse for the next one inN ew Delhi with anticipation running high.\nWould the Ferozeshah Kotla, where in  Gavaskar had drawn\nlevel with Don Bradman's then record of centuries, witness another\nmoment of cricket history?\nTendulkar did not disappoint. Century number -and the new\nworld record was reached just as darkness descended at the end of the\nfirst day. The record that Gavaskar established stood for over two decades\nand would stay in India for some more years to come.\nTendulkar had not been fluent to start with and had crawled to his\nhalf-century from  balls. But he opened out in the final session\nand three boundaries in a Murali over signalled his intentions.\nOnce the landmark was reached with a tuck off his hips off\nChaminda Vaas, the roar of the crowd was deafening. The bat was\nraised, the fist was clenched and a long lingering look at the sky marked\nthe magical moment.\nWhen asked in an interview in The Spottstar ( December )\nabout the emotions of the moment, he replied: 'I have always tried to\nkeep my emotions under check. But there are times when you just\ncan't keep them under control. This was one occasion when I wouldn't\nhave been honest had I not expressed my emotions. I am as human as\nanyone else.' He dedicated the record to his late father.\nIt had been exactly a year since the th century at Dhaka and\nthose  months were filled with physical pain and mental agony. But\nSunny Eclipsed\n\n\n\n\fit had all been worthwhile in the end as the cricket world saluted the\nmaster who made the record his own after long years.\nWhen asked in the same interview what he was most proud of, his\nreply was short and simple: 'My discipline.'\nWinning the Test match and the next one at Ahmedabad only\nmade things sweeter and the Dravid-Chappell combine now appeared\nto have settled into the job comfortably.\nFor the third time in two years, India and Pakistan would clash on\na cricket pitch. The encounters were now beginning to feel passe and\nsome of the tension traditionally associated with them had been lost as\na result of their frequent meetings. Now at the start of, India\nwere once again crossing the border for three Test matches and five\nODIS.\n\nThe first Test at Lahore and the second at Faisalabad turned out to\nbe bloated run-feasts. Bowlers on both sides were left despairing as to\nwhen the next wicket would fall.\nThey certainly got their revenge at Karachi, for most of the match\nat least.\nThe Test started in a sensational manner with Irfan Pathan\nclaiming a hat-trick in the very first over of the match. Pakistan\nrecovered and inched ahead by just seven runs on the first innings.\nBut in the second they piled up another massive total and declared on\n for.\nIt meant the famed Indian batting line-up had to survive  overs\nto salvage a draw. Instead, they folded up in . overs and a little over\nfour hours for  runs. The dreaded fourth innings bogey had\nreturned.\nPakistan's thumping victory by  runs was their biggest in terms\nof runs and a stunning turnaround after crashing to  for  on the\nfirst morning.\nTendulkar finished with  and  and the photo ofhim nearly\nsquatting on his haunches as a Mohammad Asif special speared out\nhis off stump in the second innings was splashed across most of the\nIndian dailies. It was not a pleasant sight for Indian fans and one\nnewspaper had the temerity to headline their report 'Endulkar?' The\n\n\nSachin\n\n\faccompanying article raised the question for the first time as to whether\nhe was nearing the end of his career.\nAlthough he had recorded the world Test record hundred six weeks\nearlier in Delhi, Tendulkar looked below his attacking best on the\ntour and the spate of injuries only added to the speculation. He had\nappeared tentative in Pakistan, hit on the helmet by a Shoaib Akhtar\ndelivery in Karachi. His dismissal in the second Test at Faisalabad also\nraised eyebrows. He walked after gloving Shoaib behind the stumps,\nthough television replays suggested he was not out because his hand\nwas off the bat.\nNot one to react to the media, Sachin, it appeared, had taken the\noffending headline and analysis to heart and lashed out at a press\nconference. Within the team there was a feeiing that it had all been too\ninsulting in tone.\nBut the team came roaring back to crush Pakistan - in the om\nseries. Tendulkar played a major role with  in the opening game at\nPeshawar which India lost on the Duckworth-Lewis method. It was\nhis first om century in  months and in that period he had managed\nonly  runs from  matches averaging a shade over .\nIndia swept the next four matches and his innings of  in the\nthird at Lahore was Tendulkar at his best. There was a magical touch\nto his strokes and the Pakistani bowlers were at his mercy. So the\nresults for the team and his own batting in Pakistan had been decidedly\nmixed.\nThe visiting English team appeared down and out even before the\nstart of the Test series in March . Captain Michael Vaughan\njoined paceman Simon Jones and opener Marcus Trescothick on the\nearly departure list and Ashes hero Andrew Flintoff took over the\ncaptaincy for\" the first time.\nThe first Test at N agpur was drawn and then India rolled over the\nvisitors at Mohali to win the second by nine wickets. It looked like a\nrout would be in store in the third and final Test at Mumbai. Instead,\nEngland came roaring back to win the match by  runs, their first\non Indian soil since , and against all odds the series was left\ndeadlocked at -.\nSunny Eclipsed\n\nll\n\n\fDravid's decision to ask England to bat first on winning the toss\nleft all and sundry dumbfounded. It was a stunning move which left\nIndian cricket fans fuming and even Tendulkar had to face the wrath\nof his home fans for the first time.\nSet  runs in the fourth innings, the batting folded up in one of\nthe direst batting displays on home soil by an Indian side in living\nmemory.\nTendulkar was top scorer with  but when he departed at  for ,\nthe boos from a small section of the crowd at the Wankhede Stadium\ncame as a shock to everyone present.\nThe bitter taste of that capitulation was soon forgotten though as\nIndia stormed to a - victory in the ODI series.\nTendulkar, though, once again had to sit it out with an injury, his\nthird in successive years. This time it was a tear in the right shoulder\nthat required surgery. It meant he was forced to miss the tour of the\nWest Indies with India winning a Test series in the Caribbean for the\nfirst time since , though they were outclassed in the oms.\nSachin had a brief stint with the Lashings club side in England in\ncharity matches after surgery to test his fitness.\nHe was back in India colours after a break of five months for the\ntri-series in Sri Lanka in August. Sachin faced just three deliveries in\nthe first match at Colombo before it was abandoned due to rain with\nIndia at  for no loss against the hosts.\nThe tri-series was reduced to a bilateral one after a bomb blast in\nColombo sent the South Africans scurrying home. But the persistently\nbad weather wrecked the whole event.\nThe next test ofSachin's fitness would be the tri-series in Kuala\nLumpur, the first time India (and Sachin) would be playing in the\nMalaysian capital since the  Commonwealth Games.\nAll doubts were put to rest as he smashed five sixes (and  fours)\nin a masterly innings of  not out against the West Indies. His th\n century was not enough though as India were unfortunate to be\nedged out via the Duckworth-Lewis method.\nDespite the disappointment with the result, Tendulkar was\ndelighted with his form and fitness, terming it a 'special hundred'.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fWhat made it special was that he batted right through the  overs for\nonly the second time in  matches.\nRival captain Brian Lara was lavish in his praise. 'For a guy coming\nback after six months, it showed how much of a genius he is. We just\nhad to watch it and appreciate it, and it was a very special innings for\nIndia.'\nTendulkar also scored  in the return match but flopped in the\ntwo games against Australia ( and ), and India failed to reach the\nfinal.\nThe Champions Trophy was another disappointment as hosts India\nlost two of their three matches and were knocked out before the semifinals.\nNow it was time for South Mrica where India had not won a Test\nmatch on three previous tours.\nThings looked ominous however as India were totally outclassed\nand lost all four oms. Tendulkar contributed just one half-century.\nBut there was a silver lining in the one-off T- International at\nJohannesburg which India won by six wickets with a ball to spare.\nIt remains the only Twenty International in which Tendulkar\n(he scored ) has played and though no one could have dreamed of it\nat the time, India would take the cricket world by storm at the same\nvenue less than a year later.\nThe big story on the eve of the Test series was the return of Ganguly\nafter almost a year out of the Indian side. He was one of the batting\nstars in a low-scoring first Test at Johannesburg which India won by\n runs. Finally, India could boast of a Test match victory in every\ncricket playing country around the world.\nBut the wheels fell off the Indian campaign after that and they\nwere well beaten in the next two matches to lose the series -.\nTendulkar's patchy form continued into the Test series with only\ntwo half-centuries from six innings. But it was his batting in the second\ninnings of the third Test at Cape Town that had the critics scratching\ntheir heads in dismay. Despite gaining a small first innings lead, the\nIndian batsmen retreated into their shells in the second with debutant\nslow left-armer Paul Harris tying down Dravid and Tendulkar.\nSunny Eclipsed\n\n\n\n\fThe two crawled to  runs from  overs to hand the advantage\nback to the battling hosts. Tendulkar scratched around for  balls in\neking out  runs in what Wisden Cricketers' Almanac described as\n'desperately unconvincing' batting. Others called the innings\n'embarrassing' and 'depressing'. It appeared the master batsman was\nweighed down by numerous factors including perhaps doubts over\nhis own fitness.\nSo the knives were out once again for captain Dravid and coach\nChappell, and Tendulkar too had a harsh spotlight trained on him. A\ncrisis seemed to be swirling round the Indian team. And now it was\nWorld Cup year again.\n\n\n\nSachin World Cup Woes\n\nWhen you are on ,just hit a six.-Arjun Tendulkar's advice to his\nfather.\nThe Indian team's preparations for the  World Cup in ~outh\nMrica entailed a tour to New Zealand which turned out to be an\nunmitigated disaster.\nThis time it was the West Indies and Sri Lanka who came over for\nfour ODis each. India won both series comfortably, but the cracks were\nbeginning to show between the players and the team management.\nTendulkar claimed the Man of the Series award against the Windies\nwith scores of, ,  and  not out at Vadodara. In addition, he\nhad the satisfaction of claiming the wicket of captain Brian Lara in the\nopening match at Nagpur just when the West Indies captain looked\nlike taking the game away from India.\nTendulkar reached three figures from  balls off the final delivery\nof the innings at Vadodara, though he was dropped twice. In terms of\nbrute force it was a vintage knock.\nHowever, he had a quieter time against the Lankans and it was\nanother veteran, Sourav Ganguly, who took the Man of the Series\naward this time.\nIndia, the  World Cup runners-up, were placed in Group B\nwith Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bermuda. The matches would be\nplayed at Port-of-Spain in Trinidad, traditionally India's favourite\nvenue.\nSo confident were the ICC oflndia and Pakistan advancing to the\nSuper  stage that they had even drawn up the schedule for the second\n\n\fstage, something unheard-of at any major sporting event.\nAs far as the ICC were concerned, the biggest match of the World\nCup would be the India-Pakistan clash confidently slated to be played\nat Bridgetown, Barbados on  April, just over a month after the\nopening match.\nThousands of bookings were made by Indian and Pakistani fans,\nmainly from the United States, and huge anticipation was building\naround the match.\nImagine the shock around the cricket world then when it was\nIreland and Bangladesh who faced each other on April!\nBehind that amazing turnaround was the story of two of the biggest\nupsets in World Cup history-Bangladesh stunning India in their\nopening Group B match and Ireland shocking Pakistan in Group D,\nboth on the same fateful day.\nThough reports of some of the Indian players partying late into\nthe night before the match are unsubstantiated, there is no doubt they\nwere over-confident going into the match. The Banglas on their part\nwent into it with a grim determination to teach the cocky Indians a\nvery expensive lesson.\nThey sure did that. India crawled to  all out in . overs with\nonly Yuvraj Singh showing some urgency towards the end of the\ninnings. Tendulkar ate up  deliveries for his painful  and looked\nuncomfortable during his  minutes at the crease.\nUnfancied Bangladesh made light of the target and reached it with\nfive wickets in hand.\nBack home, a mixture of gloom and disbelief spread across the\ncountry. Suddenly one of the favourites for the title found themselves\nin a tight corner-they would have to win their remaining two matches\nto have a realistic chance of making it to the next stage.\nBermuda were never going to be a problem and India became the\nfirst team to post a -plus total in a World Cup match.\nSri Lanka were another matter altogether. Although India had\nbeaten them easily in their last two ODI series, both had been played at\nhome. And the Lankans had crushed Bangladesh and Bermuda in\ntheir two group games.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fIndian cricket's worst nightmare came true. Lanka's total of\nfor  was challenging, though not formidable. But the Indian batting\nwas just not up to the task. They collapsed to  all out and the\ndreams ofhundreds of millions lay dashed.\nWhen Tendulkar was bowled third ball without scoring by Dilhara\nFernando at  for , the fight had been knocked out of the side. Dravid\nplayed a lone hand with , but it was far from enough.\nIndian fans reacted with fury. They may have been justified in\ntheir anger. But some of the reactions were condemnable. Players'\nproperties were vandalized in the full glare of TV news cameras.\nMotives were ascribed, and the patriotism and commitment of the\nplayers were questioned.\nThe BCCI, instead of trying to heal the wounds, decided the time\nwas ripe to crack the whip; after all, they had public sentiment on their\nside. India's cricketers who were long used to adulation suddenly found\nthemselves painted as villains.\nCoach Chappell's contract had been till the end of the World Cup\nand he resigned before he was asked to go.\nThe tensions between the players and the coach had become ever\nmore evident as the World Cup dragged on and now they came out\ninto the open. It was as iflndian cricket had descended into a free-forall.\nRumours abounded that there was a movement among the senior\nplayers to replace Dravid as captain with Tendulkar as the feeling was\nthe incumbent was too much of a Chappell man.\nIt was alleged that Chappell had sent a letter to the Board\ncomplaining about the attitude of the seniors in the team and now\nTendulkar stepped forward as the players' senior statesman to air their\nfeelings.\nIt was a role he had rarely taken up throughout his career when he\npreferred to keep a low profile during every crisis, even at the height of\nmatch-fixing when his intervention may have doused the flames.\nTendulkar now poured out his soul, claiming he was 'shattered\nbeyond words' by the World Cup debacle. He said he had given his\nWorld Cup Woes\n\n\n\n\fheart and soul to cricket for  years but that in all those years no\ncoach had ever doubted his attitude. While admitting the team played\nbadly he added, 'What hurt us most is that the coach has questioned\nour attitude.'\nChappell predictably denied the contents of the letter, but now it\nwas time for Indian cricket to move on.\nIronically, the next contest was in Bangladesh, the same side that\nhad caused India's downfall in the Caribbean.\nIt was announced that both Tendulkar and Ganguly had been\n'rested' for the om series. But few could deny that this was in fact the\nfirst time Tendulkar was actually dropped from the Indian side since\nhis debut back in .\nHe was back for the two Test matches and feasted on the weak\nbowling to record two more centuries.\nThe ever-busy Indian cricket team was next in England. India\nfaced South Mrica in three oms at Belfast prior to the Test series and\nthe horrors of the whitewash in South Mrica a year earlier were put\nbehind them as India won the series -.\nTendulkar regained his rightful place in the side and was Man of\nthe Series with scores of,  and . He also passed , runs in\nthe series.\nThat  was particularly mortifying as he was run out inches short\nof the crease. It was the first time he had been out for  in an\ninternational match but he batted for  balls. Only four times had\nhe batted for longer in oms and each time he went on to a big hundred.\nThe first  took  balls, slow even by Test standards. But he was back\nto his dominating best in the very next match.\nIt was in England in  that the teenager had first announced\nhimself with his maiden Test century at Old Trafford. Six years later\nhe was established as one of world cricket's finest batsmen, and he\nconsolidated that status in .\nNow five years later he was back for his fourth England Test tour\nin his new position as the senior statesman of the team and still, after\nall these years, one of the best in the world.\nIndia were very lucky indeed to escape with a draw in the first Test\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fat Lord's with nine wickets down and the weather playing a big part in\nthe proceedings.\nTendulkar did not make much of an impact in the Test with scores\nof and  as India, set a target of to win, finished at  for nine.\nA mini-storm erupted back home when Kapil Dev made the point\nthat Tendulkar had failed to deliver in crunch situations throughout\nhis long and illustrious career.\nThe criticism may have stung but statistics hacked up Kapil. Till\ndate Tendulkar had batted  times in the last innings of a Test and\nhad scored over  on just four occasions. His fourth innings average\nof. till the Lord's Test paled before his first innings average of\n..\nIndia came roaring back to win the second Test at Trent Bridge by\nseven wickets, only the fifth time they had won a Test in England in\n years.\nZaheer Khan was the bowling hero with nine wickets while\nTendulkar with  in the first innings was India's top scorer.\nBut the innings also signalled that his days of dominating Test\nattacks were over. Left-arm pace bowler Ryan Sidebottom in particular\ntroubled the master batsman and did everything short of getting his\nwicket. Off the  balls he bowled to Tend ulkar, only seven runs were\nscored and the bowler had three lbw appeals turned down.\nHaving battled so hard for over four hours, it was a travesty of\njustice when he was given out leg before to Paul Collingwood nine\nshort of his century in a shocking decision by umpire Simon Taufel.\nThe world's leading umpire later admitted he was 'very upset' about\nthe decision.\nBy drawing the third and final Test at the Oval, India had won a\nseries in England for only the third time, and the first since . It\nwas a feather in the cap for captain Rahul Dravid. His decision to quit\nthe captaincy weeks later thus came as a shock.\nThough he made  in the first innings at the Oval, it was the first\ntime on four visits that Tendulkar had failed to score a century in the\nTest series. England came back to win a thrilling oor series - after\nthe teams were deadlocked going into the final game at Lord's. Here\nWorld Cup Woes\n\nlSI\n\n\fthe Indian batsmen once again crumbled in a pressure situation\nhaving fought back after trailing - in the series.\nTendulkar's odd run of the s continued. For the second time he\nwas out on , a marginal decision by the umpire ruling him caught\nbehind off Andrew Flintoff in the match at Bristol which India won\nby runs.\nHe also scored  in the penultimate game at Old Trafford and had\ntwo other s. But his  in the decider at Lord's was not enough.\nIt was in South Mrica just six months after India's World Cup\ndebacle that an earthquake of sorts hit the cricket world. Dravid,\nGanguly and Tendulkar had all made themselves unavailable for the\ninaugural World Twenty championship, though they may well\nhave been advised to, to avoid any embarrassment. The Indian selectors\nrightly decided to go with a youthful team under new captain\nMahendra Singh Dhoni.\nWhen India beat Pakistan in the final in Johannesburg on \nSeptember  it would set in motion a movement that would rival\nthe fallout oflndia's stunning triumph in the  Prudential World\nCup.\nLess than a week after the final-with all of India still busy\ncelebrating-the Australians landed in India determined to avenge\ntheir defeat in the semi-finals of the T World Cup.\nThey came to India as reigning world -overs champions and\nthe best Test side in the world as well and proved their might by\ntrouncing India - in the ODI series. India though had the consolation\nofbeating them in the lone T match.\nTendulkar topped the averages for the Indians but his two halfcenturies in the series were not enough to prevent Australia's victory.\nDhoni's elevation to the captaincy of the -overs game was only\nnatural once Dravid had quit. But the appointment ofAnil Kumble as\nTest captain came as a pleasant surprise. Tendulkar had been sounded\nout too, but he declined what would have been his third time in charge.\nKumble's first assignment was when Pakistan visited India late in\nthe year.\nBut before the Test series, India defeated Pakistan - in the oms\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fand for Tendulkar the jinx of continued-he was out for  (in\nthe second match at Mohali) for the third time in the year and then for\n in the fourth match at Gwalior.\nIt meant he had been out in the s six times in oms in \nleading to son Arjun's sage piece of advice: 'Next time you are on ,\njust hit a six .. .'\nKumble's first Test as captain at the age of was at his favourite\nground, the Feroze Shah Kotla in New Delhi, and India maintained\ntheir streak at the ground by winning the Test by six wickets early on\nthe fifth day, their seventh straight at the capital.\nBut with Shoaib Akhtar at his fiery best in the second innings,\nIndia looked shaky chasing  when the fast bowler grabbed the top\nthree wickets with  on the board.\nTendular's innings was a mix of caution and some splendid\nboundaries. He thwarted Shoaib's pace and looked calm and collected\nthroughout, fittingly finishing it off by smashing the fast bowler for\nhis ninth boundary. That crucial innings of  not out made up for\nthe first innings when he was run out for  after a mix-up with Dravid.\nSachin's contribution was  in the second Test at Kolkata which\nended in a draw, but he was forced to miss the final Test at Bangalore\nwith a stiffknee.\nThat Test was drawn too, giving India their first Test victory on\nhome soil against Pakistan since -.\nThe next challenge would be the sternest test of them all, a tour of\nAustralia.\n\nWorld Cup Woes\n\n Back on Top\n\nI just think Sachin played a super super knock today. just like the man he is.\n-Kevin Pietersen.\nFootballers for decades have found themselves caught in the clubversus-country dilemma. International cricket has had plenty of\nproblems ofit:s own to tackle, but this was one that was unheard-oftill the arrival of the Indian Premier League. And the dilemma is\nbound to grow if Twenty leagues start sprouting up around the\ncricket world.\nThe question ofwhether Tendulkar rushed his return to assist the\nMumbai Indians despite not being fully fit was raised in the previous\nchapter.\nNow it emerged the groin strain had not healed and it would keep\nhim out of the  tri-series in Bangladesh and the Asia Cup in\nPakistan. Just before the IPL the same injury had forced him to miss\ntwo Test matches against South Mrica as well.\nHe was back for the Test series in Sri Lanka, but it was not a happy\ntime either for Tendulkar or the Indian team. The Lankans won the\nseries -, the same margin as in India's previous tour in , and\nTendulkar could only eke out a miserable  runs from six innings. It\nwas the worst Test series of his career.\nTo add to his woes, the wretched run of injuries was back and this\ntime it was his left elbow that suffered while he attempted a catch in\nthe third Test at Colombo. It meant he had to miss the  series that\nfollowed.\nHis absence was hardly felt though as M.S. Dhoni led India to\n\n\ftheir first series triumph on Lankan soil.\nAustralia's trip to India in late  was the fourth India-Australia\nseries in the last five seasons and was once again highly anticipated.\nApart from the drawn first Test at Bangalore when they had sessions\nof domination, the Australians found themselves outclassed and lost\ntwo of the four Tests.\nThere were plenty ofdramatic moments throughout the series but\nnone more so than the sudden retirement of captain Ani! Kumble on\nthe final day of the third Test in New Delhi. It meant Dhoni was now\nleading the nation in all three formats.\nHaving pocketed the record for most Test centuries three years\nearlier, it was now time for Tendulkar to make another significant\nmark all his own-most Test runs.\nThroughout their careers Tendulkar and Brian Lara had been neckand-neck in batting feats and became great friends and competitors\nalong the way. The West Indian retired at the end of the  World\nCup but not before he had amassed , Test runs.\nIt was only a matter time before Sachin surpassed that figure and it\nhappened the first ball after tea on the first day of the second Test at\nMohali. There was just a sprinkling of spectators-augmented by a\nbunch of schoolchildren who were brought in-to see him scamper\nfor the three runs he needed, and then the celebrations broke out. A\ntouch over the top perhaps. Firecrackers were set offby the organizers,\nholding up play even as the Australians led by Panting rushed to\ncongratulate Tendulkar on his latest record.\nThe man himself reacted as ifhe had reached three figures who\nwas actually on . It was quite understandable though as it was another\nburden lifted offhis shoulders.\nIndia were losing wickets at the other end and were in a spot of\nbother before Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly bailed them out.\nMore landmarks were cross~:d-his th Test half-century and\nthen the first batsman to go past , runs. The spotlight stayed on\nhim the whole day despite Ganguly reaching his century in his final\nTest series.\nBut Tendulkar was to be denied a century of his own. It was\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fdebutant pace bowler Peter Siddle who got his wicket for  shortly\nbefore stumps on the first day.\n'Success is a process and during that journey sometimes there are\nstones thrown at you and you convert them into milestones. It's a\ngreat feeling' was how he summed up the journey that had begun \nyears ago.\nAustralia were thoroughly outplayed and lost the Test by the\nmassive margin of  runs. It was India's biggest Test win and\nAustralia's heaviest defeat in terms of runs against India. The critics\nwho labelled the visitors as the weakest to visit India since Kim\nHughes's side nearly  years earlier were being proved correct.\nThe Australian eclipse was complete when they went down by\n runs in the fourth and final Test at N agpur.\nTendulkar's  in the first innings was his th Test century and\n'h against Australia and, with  runs in the series, he had once\nagain bounced back from a bad patch.\nIndia regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time since\n, and Panting and his team were left to lick their wounds.\nIt was a rare defeat for the world champions. But their decline was\nconfirmed later in the season when they were beaten on home soil by\nSouth Africa and also toppled off their top spot in the ODI rankings.\nIt was midway through the series that extracts from Adam\nGilchrist's new autobiography True Colours created a stir. Gilchrist, in\nhis book, claimed Tendulkar was something of a sore loser and had\nchanged his testimony in the so-called 'Monkey-gate' episode. Both\nallegations were swiftly refuted by Tendulkar and others connected\nwith the episode, forcing Gilchrist to backtrack from his comments\nand phone Tendulkar to personally apologize. The controversy though\nsurely helped boost sales of his book.\nTendulkar requested the selectors to rest him for the first three oms\nagainst England in late . A surfeit of cricket and a spate of injuries\nwere no doubt behind the decision.\nBy the time he returned at Bangalore, India were - ahead with\nfour to go. They made it -- by winning both at Ban galore and Cuttack\nand the first - sweep in international cricket was looming large.\nBack on Top\n\n\n\n\fBut by the time the players got back to their hotel rooms at the end\nof the Cuttack match, events were unfolding in Mumbai that would\nshake the nation to its core and send shockwaves throughout the world.\nThe horror of the / terrorist attack on Mumbai was witnessed\non TV by the players and it was immediately decided to call off the tour.\nA shocked English team rushed back home.\nNo one pointed fingers at them this time. The unprecedented\nhorror of the attacks left everyone stunned with some of the Indian\nplayers confessing they had barely slept the three days the trauma\nstretched on for.\nThere was no pressure on England to return for the two Test\nmatches. But a decision had to be made and in the end, the English\nteam-particularly captain Kevin Pietersen-won the hearts of all\nIndians by coming back. It was a great boost to the morale of the\nnation which had suffered grievously.\nThe wounds were still raw when the Chennai Test began under\nfortress-like conditions in the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium. Mter all,\nit was just a fortnight since the heinous attacks had finally been\nrepulsed.\nThe return of international cricket at least gave the nation\nsomething to look forward to and a feeling that normalcy was fast\nbeing restored. But for the Indian players the first half of the Test\nflashed by as if in a surreal haze.\nIn fact England dominated the match for three-and-half-days\nbefore the home side pulled themselves back.\nWith a first innings lead of runs, Pietersen declared the England\nsecond innings with nine wickets down and set India  as the\nimprobable winning target. In  years of Test cricket on Indian soil\nno team had crossed  to win.\nIt took Sehwag's audacious batting to snatch the advantage out of\nEngland's hands. He did not spare any of the bowlers and raced to \nfrom  balls before falling lbw shortly before stumps on the fourth\nday. The opening stand with Gautam Gambhir was worth  at five\nruns per over and now the momentum was with India.\nResuming on  for one on the final day, India lost Dravid,\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fGambhir and Laxman for the addition of runs and at  for four,\nthe English bowlers were back on top. The Indian batting line-up had\ndeveloped a nasty habit of caving in to pressure in the fourth innings\nand  certainly looked a bridge too far.\nThis is where Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh took over. The young\nleft-hander was still struggling to establish himself in the Test side\nand hoping to fill the big boots of the retired Ganguly.\nSuch was the mastery of the pair that at no stage did England look\ncapable of a breakthrough. The crowd, which had been sparse till\nthen, began to steadily build as word spread through the city that\nTendulkar was producing an innings of a lifetime with his young\npartner not too far behind.\nThere was a steely determination about Tendulkar's batting that\nwas awe-inspiring. It became clear as the day wore on and the target\ncame ever closer that this would be his moment.\nSure enough with his own score on  and four needed for victory,\ndestiny played its final hand-off spinner Graeme Swann was swept\nto the fine leg boundary and the victory as well as Tendulkar's st\ncentury were reached simultaneously.\nIt was only his third century in the fourth innings of a Test and the\nfirst time it had resulted in a win. The previous two-at Old Trafford\nin  and at Chennai against Pakistan in -ended in a draw\nand defeat for India, respectively. As Yuvraj lifted his idol in his arms,\nthe crowd erupted in joy as did millions oflndian fans watching on TV\naround the world.\nRavi Shastri with mike in hand captured the moment perfectly as\nhe interviewed the jubilant pair on the edge of the ground.\nHis face streaked with sweat, grime and tears, Tendulkar dedicated\nthe victory to the nation. He could not wipe the broad smile off his\nface, yet his voice was choking with emotion. No wonder he said the\ncentury ranked with the very best of his career.\nNot even an Indian fan could have put it better when Pietersen\ncommented: 'I just think Sachin played a super super knock today.\nJust like the man he is.'\nThough defeat would have been a bitter pill to swallow for England,\nBack on Top\n\n\n\n\fsomehow the feeling was there were no losers at the end of the Test. It\nwas that kind of a day.\nFormer England bowler and columnist Mike Selvey summed it\nall up in one word: 'karma.'\nWhat followed was always going to be anti-climactic and, sure\nenough, the Mohali Test ended in a dreary draw.\nDespite the injuries and the setback in the IPL,  turned out to\nbe another splendid year for Tendulkar what with a major world record\nin his pocket. He finished with  runs, the fifth time in his career\nhe had crossed  Test runs in a calendar year and the first time\nsince .\nIn  he had amassed  runs in ODI runs, the seventh such\noccasion in his career. So notwithstanding the injuries and the doubters\n(former team-mate Sanjay Manjrekar being the foremost and most\nvocal), Tendulkar was once again among the top batsmen in the world.\nThe cancellation of the Pakistan tour allowed the top players to\nmake a rare appearance in the Ranji Trophy.\nSachin's century in the semi-finals against Saurashtra was the th\nof his first-class career, including the  centuries in Test matches.\nBut in the final against Uttar Pradesh at Hyderabad that Mumbai\nwon, he was out for  and .\nRemarkably, that first innings duck was the first time he had been\ndismissed without scoring in a domestic first-class match on Indian\nsoil.\nThe year  marks the th anniversary of Sachin's bow in\ninternational cricket. It was announced in January that he had been\nawarded the Padma Vibhushan by the government, the second highest\ncivilian honour after the Bharat Ratna. World chess champion\nVishwanathan Anand is the only other sportsperson to receive the\nhonour.\nOver the last two decades Sachin has made most of the major\nbatting records his own. A double century in oms-he would be the\nfirst-and a triple in Tests are two marks he may still be secretly hoping\nto achieve.\n\n\nSachin\n\n\fThe Pakistan tour cancellation also led to a hastily arranged ODI\nseries in Sri Lanka.\nOnce India had won the first three games to seal the five-match\nseries, it was decided to give Tendulkar a break. His patience must also\nhave been tested as he was given out lbw to dodgy decisions in all\nthree matches for low scores.\nThe decision to skip select oms and also opt out of T-\nInternationals appears to be a well-thought-out plan to preserve himself\nat least till when India is to co-host the World Cup for the third\ntime.\nThough he has never stated so explicitly, there have been hints\nthat the World Cup will be Sachin's swansong.\nWinning a World Cup for India has been his most fervent wish\nand  will surely be his last chance in what would be his sixth\nappearance in the premier -overs championship.\n\nBack on Top\n\n"
