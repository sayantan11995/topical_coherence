STAYING AT THE TOP

In 2010, we faced three of the toughest assignments in international cricket and to maintain our
number-one position we needed to do well in all of them. We had to play South Africa at home in
February–March, Australia at home in October and New Zealand at home in November, before finally
travelling to South Africa in December.
Before all these, however, we went to Bangladesh for a two-Test series in January 2010. While
many feel Bangladesh are a pushover, they have surprised many a good side in the past and you
underestimate them at your peril. This was evident in the first Test at Chittagong, which started on 17
January, where we were reduced to 209–8 in the first innings. The crowd was behind the local team
and batting was a serious challenge against an inspired bowling attack, with Shahadat Hossain and
Shakib-Al-Hasan both finally taking five wickets. Every wicket was greeted with a loud cheer and
every boundary with pin-drop silence.
It was interesting to bat in front of such a partisan crowd. I scored 105 not out and we somehow
managed to post a score of 243. Our bowlers did well to restrict Bangladesh in their first innings to
one run less than our total, then Gambhir scored a century in our second innings, helping us to 413.
Despite a century from Mushfiqur Rahim, the 415-run target proved too much for Bangladesh and we
ended up winning by 113 runs.
In the second Test at Dhaka a few days later, where it was hot and sultry after the haze and chill in
Chittagong, our fast bowlers again delivered in difficult conditions, with Zaheer bowling at his best in
the second innings, getting an incredible amount of reverse swing to take seven wickets. We had
batted well in our first and only innings, making 544, and Rahul and I scored centuries, setting the
match up for Zaheer.

South Africa in India, February 2010
We reassembled to take on the South Africans in the first of two Tests at Nagpur on 6 February. The
points situation meant that whoever won the series would be the number-one Test team.
In the first Test, Dale Steyn bowled brilliantly, ending up with ten wickets, and we were
comprehensively beaten. Hashim Amla, with 253, and Jacques Kallis, with 173, batted superbly for
South Africa and Amla was in extraordinary batting form right through the series. Kallis has always
been a champion performer and is undoubtedly the best all-round cricketer of our generation. It has
been a pleasure competing with players like these, who will surely be remembered as all-time greats.
Though we lost the game, I did manage to make a hundred in the second innings and I liked to think
that my plan against Dale Steyn had started to work. He is an exceptional fast bowler and we knew we
would need to play him well to make a comeback in the second Test, so the second-innings batting
effort gave us a little hope in this regard. On the other hand, we had to accept that we had made it

difficult for ourselves and were going to have to play out of our skins to retain our number-one Test
ranking.
We were surprised to see a green top awaiting us at Eden Gardens. It had all but nullified the
concept of home advantage, but there was nothing we could do about the pitch at that stage.
Again South Africa started well, but then we staged a miraculous comeback towards the end of the
first day. From a position of strength at 218–1, South Africa collapsed to a modest 296 all out thanks
to some terrific bowling from Zaheer and Harbhajan. We sensed we were in with a chance and put
together a big first-innings total, with as many as four of us – Sehwag, Laxman, Dhoni and myself –
getting hundreds. Sehwag and I had a terrific partnership of 249 after losing two quick wickets and we
also scored at a phenomenal pace, unsettling the South Africans. Anything on middle-and-leg was
flicked to the on side, while anything outside off stump was cut or driven. It was a dominant
partnership and swung the pendulum in our favour.
Laxman and Dhoni built on the platform and we finally declared at a whopping 643–6, leaving the
South Africans two whole days to bat to save the game. Unfortunately for us, the weather intervened
on day four and a lot of overs were lost. By the end of the day South Africa had lost three wickets and
we still needed seven wickets to close out the match.
The final day at Eden Gardens was Test cricket at its very best. Bhajji, who has a phenomenal
record in Kolkata, bowled superbly, finishing with eight wickets in the match, and we took the final
South African wicket with just a few overs remaining. The Eden Gardens crowd was behind us and the
last wicket, Morne Morkel lbw to Bhajji, was greeted with a deafening roar. Bhajji ran almost half the
length of the ground in delight and we were thrilled to have pulled off a stunning victory. We had
retained our number-one ranking in the process and I felt all the more satisfied to think that, although
my first hundred didn’t save the first Test, my second one did contribute to our win in the second Test.
In the three-match one-day series that followed I was run out for four in the first game at Jaipur on
21 February. I was disappointed with the dismissal but was pleased that I managed to make a
contribution in the last over of the game, when the South Africans needed just ten runs to win. Dale
Steyn and Wayne Parnell had staged a fantastic fightback after being reduced to 225–8 chasing 299,
and though Praveen Kumar picked up Steyn with the first ball of his final over, the South Africans
were within striking distance of the total. The last man, Charl Langeveldt, hit the third ball of the over
past short fine leg and at long leg I dived full length to save what was a certain boundary. The umpires
consulted the third umpire before finally ruling it a legal save. This made the difference in the end,
with India winning the match by one run.
By the time of the second match, in Gwalior on 24 February, I was starting to feel really tired. It
had been a long season and my body was beginning to raise some objections. I had aches and pains
everywhere; my back was stiff, my ankles felt tight and my knees hurt. The physio Nitin Patel had to
treat me for an hour and a half on the morning of the match and I told him that I wanted to finish the
series off at Gwalior so that I could ask to be rested for the third and final game of the series.
When I got to the ground, all the pains and aches had just disappeared! I don’t know how it
happened but it was one of those days when everything seemed to go my way. We batted first and I
barely pushed at a ball from Wayne Parnell in the second over and was amazed to see it racing to the
boundary. After that the balls consistently hit the middle of my bat and the run rate didn’t drop for the
entire innings.
I had some good partnerships, first with Dinesh Karthik, then with Yusuf Pathan and finally with
MS Dhoni, and they all batted well to take the pressure off me. It was only after I had passed 175 that
I started to think about a double hundred. I had lost a bit of strength by then and, unable to play big

shots, switched to finding the gaps and running hard. I was still running even when I was in the 190s,
while Dhoni was pounding the bowling at the other end.
The moment finally arrived in the fiftieth over of our innings, when I steered the ball behind point
for a single, becoming the first in the history of cricket to score an ODI double century. I was
particularly glad I had been able to achieve the landmark in front of a home crowd. The team total had
reached 400 and the sensation could not have been any better. In the changing room, Sehwag said to
me, ‘Aakhir aapne 200 bana hi diya!’ (So you finally did score the ODI double ton!)
The job, however, was only half done and we knew South Africa had successfully chased 434 in
2006 – against Australia, no less – so it wasn’t a time to relax. History was not repeated in Gwalior,
though, and in the end we managed to win the match convincingly by a 153-run margin.
Back in the hotel, I was feeling really tired but, because of all the excitement, was unable to sleep.
Lying awake in bed, I decided to check my phone and found that it was flooded with messages
congratulating me and I spent two hours responding to them, a task that eventually took me two days
to complete. I was up early the next morning, too, but it didn’t really matter, as I was heading home
for a much-needed break after one of my best ever seasons in international cricket.
I have to admit that there was another reason I could not sleep in Gwalior. The hotel authorities had
very kindly given both Dhoni and me a suite each and these were located at a fair distance from the
rooms of the rest of the team. My suite was enormous and even had a private swimming pool. The
bathroom was gigantic and was separated from the main living room by a glass door. Outside there
were huge trees and at night, with the silk curtains fluttering in the breeze, I didn’t find it the most
comfortable room to sleep in. It was pitch dark outside and the size of the room, together with the
unfamiliar sights and sounds around, made me seriously uneasy and I had to keep the bathroom lights
on all night!

Australia in India, October 2010
We started the 2010–11 season with a two-Test series against Australia. In the first match in Mohali at
the beginning of October, VVS Laxman played one of his best ever innings for the team. Needing 216
to win, we had lost our eighth wicket with 92 runs still to get and Laxman, nursing a sore back, was
our only hope. He batted like a man possessed, supported by Ishant Sharma, who showed exemplary
grit for his 31. Though Ishant fell with 11 runs still to get, Laxman batted on and took us over the line,
to win by one wicket. Laxman tormented the Australians throughout his career and this was another
occasion when they threw everything at him but still couldn’t dislodge him. Laxman is one of the few
batsmen capable of playing two different shots off every ball and his supple wrists made him a joy to
watch from the other end.
Having beaten Australia at Mohali, we had already retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy when we
arrived at Bangalore for the second and final Test of the series on 9 October. At the Chinnaswamy

Stadium, Australia batted first, scoring a healthy 478, helped by a career-best 128 from Marcus North.
I felt in good form from the very start of my innings. Not out on 44 at the end of day two, I batted
through the whole of the next day and remained unbeaten on 191. I reached my forty-ninth Test
hundred with consecutive sixes off Nathan Hauritz. It was my sixth Test century of the year and I had
amassed more than 1000 Test runs in a calendar year for the sixth time in my career.
I eventually fell for 214 and, with the help of Murali Vijay’s 139, we managed a slender firstinnings lead of seven runs before our bowlers got in on the act and dismissed Australia for just 223 in
their second innings. We needed 207 to win the series 2–0 and I had the privilege of taking the team to
victory with young Cheteshwar Pujara, who, on debut, scored a valiant 72 not out batting at number
three, a position he has now made his own for India. I am convinced he has a great future ahead of him
as a Test player.

An unwelcome distraction
Next up was a three-Test home series against New Zealand in November 2010. Though we won the
series 1–0, my own form took a dip. Everyone had started talking about my fiftieth Test hundred and it
became hard to concentrate. The crowds were trying to get behind me and in Hyderabad, during the
second Test, people kept waving at me even when I was batting. My usual routine was to walk away
towards the square-leg umpire after playing each ball, but the crowd at square leg went up every time I
looked at them, which unsettled me. I know they meant well, but I couldn’t help thinking to myself,
‘They should let me bat in peace,’ and it wasn’t long before I was out.
When you are batting well, it’s good to have the crowd behind you like that. When you are
struggling, it can make things doubly difficult. After the Hyderabad Test I said to Gary and Paddy that
I was looking forward to the South Africa series because at least the crowds there wouldn’t obsess
about it so much.
I actually had a good chance to get the century out of the way in Nagpur in the third Test, which
started on 20 November. I was 57 not out overnight in our only innings and went in on the third day
feeling pretty confident. It didn’t work out, however, as I lost my wicket after adding only four runs to
my score, getting an edge off the left-arm seamer Andy McKay to the wicketkeeper. It was a ball that
kicked up from short of a good length – the only one to do so all morning.

India in South Africa, December 2010–January 2011
Playing South Africa in South Africa was always a difficult proposition. The nature of the pitches, an
excellent fast-bowling attack and a good batting unit combined to make them a formidable opponent
at home.
In a poor start to the series, we were bowled out for 136 in our first innings at Centurion Park on 16
December, with Morne Morkel taking five wickets, and it was almost impossible to stage a comeback
from that position. I was the top scorer with 36 and I wasn’t playing too badly when a Dale Steyn
delivery came in more than expected to trap me in front. South Africa put together a huge total in
response, with a double century for Jacques Kallis and hundreds for Amla and de Villiers, and we were
left to bat for almost two and a half days to save the game.
We at least put up more of a fight in the second innings. Dhoni and I were involved in a very good
counter-attacking partnership of 172 and I was relieved to make my fiftieth Test hundred at last. We
could see the South Africans getting frustrated and towards the end of the fourth day Dale Steyn and I

exchanged a few words. The fading light had prompted Graeme Smith to give Steyn a final burst and
he came charging in. At one point he joked to me that he wasn’t bowling too fast, for it was a touch
above 150 kph. At this I asked him, ‘Where was your bravado when the sun was out?’ To be honest, all
this banter did was strengthen my resolve. It was all in good spirit, though. I have always been
opposed to ugly sledging, but a little bit of banter isn’t a bad thing on the cricket field and in fact can
add something to a high-intensity contest – as long as it remains within reasonable limits, of course.
We had lost eight wickets by the end of day four and on the final day South Africa closed out the
match comfortably to win by ten wickets. We went to Durban for the Boxing Day Test knowing that
we had a hard task ahead of us. Yet the improved batting effort in the second innings at Centurion had
given us a bit of a boost, and we felt we had at least adapted to the conditions by the time we stepped
out in Durban.

The start of the Boxing Day Test match was different, to say the least. There was a light drizzle on
the first morning and yet the pitch was left uncovered. Even the pitch report was done by the
commentators braving the drizzle, a fact that was brought to my attention by one of my team-mates.
The more the moisture, the more it was expected to favour the South African fast bowlers. I remember
telling my team-mate that such things don’t matter and it all evens out in the end.
This reminded me of something that had happened in Melbourne in December 2003. On the last day
of the Test match, with Australia needing 97 runs to win, there was a delay to the start of play despite
conditions apparently being perfect. The reason was that the pitch had been tampered with by the
groundsmen, in clear violation of the rules. At the end of day four, there was a big crack in the pitch as
a result of the wear and tear, and balls landing in the crack could have done anything. To our surprise,

the groundsmen had filled up the crack before the start of play on day five, incurring the umpires’
wrath. The umpires spotted it because the repaired area had not fully dried out and was a different
colour from the rest of the wicket. The umpires had to instruct the groundsmen to undo the repair and
restore the pitch to its original condition.
Durban was a low-scoring Test match but no less exciting for that. Zaheer came back to lead our
attack and both he and Bhajji bowled brilliantly after we had made a modest 205 in our first innings.
They combined well to finish South Africa off for just 131 in their first innings and were aided by
some brilliant catching behind the wickets. Rahul picked up his 200th catch in this match when he
caught Dale Steyn off Bhajji at slip. It was one of Rahul’s best catches and he had to dive full length
to his left and pick it up almost from behind the wicketkeeper. We celebrated the dismissal in the
knowledge that the match was gradually turning in our favour.
In our second innings, it was another VVS Laxman special that got us out of trouble. He showed
class in his innings of 96 and gave us a lead of over 300 to defend in the final innings. Laxman batted
brilliantly with the tail, which was something he was a master at in the latter stages of his career. He
was always unflustered and exuded a sense of calm which rubbed off on the other batsmen.
It was now up to Zaheer, Ishant, Sreesanth and Bhajji to finish the job and level the series. They did
it in some style. South Africa were never allowed to get away and our bowlers sent down some
unplayable deliveries. Sreesanth’s ball to Kallis that jumped from short of a length and left him in no
position to do anything was the best of the match. Zaheer had taken six wickets in the match and had
again shown his importance as the leader of the attack. It was an amazing victory, one of our best
away wins.
Before the final Test, I met up with Anjali and the kids and my friends Vivek and Sonia Palkar in
Cape Town on 30 December and we celebrated the Durban win and the penultimate day of 2010 at a
fantastic vineyard, the Constantia Uitsig. The place also had a cricket field and an excellent restaurant.
It was an experience I was looking forward to, having consciously tried to learn more about red wine
after visiting Australia in 1999. The celebrations continued on 31 December, when the team ushered in
the New Year at a fabulous hotel in the foothills of Table Mountain.
In the third and deciding Test match at Cape Town on 2 January 2011, South Africa batted first on a
pitch that offered reasonable help for the seam bowlers throughout the match. The ball was doing a lot
off the pitch and in the air and batting wasn’t easy. It was apparent to us all that South African captain
Graeme Smith was not at all comfortable against Zaheer’s left-arm swing. This was evident to us
when he played a ball to midwicket and just jogged a single when he could easily have picked up two
runs. I remember Bhajji running beside the ball and urging Smith to go for a second run. His refusal to
do so suggested he had lost the mental battle to Zaheer, and we used the opportunity to give him a
hard time in the middle. Kallis played brilliantly again, however, and, thanks to his 161, South Africa
posted a competitive 362 in their first innings.
I went in to bat towards the end of day two and played a handful of deliveries to settle in. Then I
came forward to a ball from Dale Steyn pitched on middle-and-leg and played it to midwicket for
four. Everything about that shot – the swing and flow, my body position and foot movement – felt
perfect and something told me I was in for a good innings.
The next day I resumed on 49, knowing the morning was going to be tough. Gautam Gambhir and I
were up against two of the finest bowlers in the world in Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel – and in
helpful bowling conditions. In an attempt to counter the movement, I deliberately stood outside the
crease. My thinking was that if I was beaten from there, the ball would most likely go over the stumps.
To get bowled I would have to miss an overpitched delivery, which was unlikely, and if the South

Africans decided to dig in short I could play the upper cut over the slips.
For the entire first hour, I played Dale Steyn while Gautam negotiated Morne Morkel and we both
scored a number of fours in the first ten overs. It seemed that whenever we connected, the ball raced to
the boundary. The South Africans had a lot of fielders in catching positions and it meant we got full
value for our shots. I went into lunch unbeaten on 94 and knew it would be one of my best hundreds if
I managed to get there. The task wasn’t easy, with the second new ball just two overs old.
My tactic of batting outside the crease seemed to work. That day the only delivery for which I stood
inside the crease was the fifth ball from Morne Morkel after lunch. I had a premonition that Morkel
would bowl short and so moved back inside the crease, ready to play the hook shot. Sure enough, the
ball turned out to be a chest-high bouncer and, though I got a top edge, the ball flew over the
wicketkeeper’s head for six, taking me to the fifty-first, and last, Test hundred of my career.
I know it’s bizarre but it seemed to me that five days earlier I had seen Morne’s delivery in a
dream. In the dream he had bowled a bouncer to me that I hooked to get to my hundred. I mentioned
this to my batting partner Dhoni, saying ‘Yeh ball mere life mein pehle bhi aaya hai. Mein yeh pehle
dekh chuka hoon. Aaj ye dusri bar ho raha hai.’ (This delivery has already come once before in my
life. I have seen and faced this delivery before. Today I faced it for a second time.) Who knows,
maybe it was the dream that prompted me to stand back inside the crease for that one ball!
When Harbhajan Singh came in, we were still more than a hundred runs behind South Africa and
needed one more decent partnership to get close to their total, but Harbhajan was finding it difficult to
negotiate Steyn’s fast swinging deliveries. Bhajji had scored consecutive hundreds against New
Zealand in the series before and was in good batting form, but those conditions were not best suited to
him.
I went up to tell him to forget about technique for the time being: ‘Batsman ki tahra batting mat kar
tu. Technique bhul ja. Agar ball tere range me dikhi tu ghuma. Ghuma tu kyun ki runs chahiye humhe.
Kaise bhi ho runs chahiye.’ (Don’t try to bat like a batsman. Forget about technique for the time
being. If you see the ball in your arc just hit it. We need runs at the moment. It doesn’t matter how
they come as long as they come.)
Harbhajan listened to the advice and in no time was on his way. He pulled the left-arm seamer
Lonwabo Tsotsobe for six and hit Morne Morkel for a four. But his best shot was off Dale Steyn. It
was a full delivery and Harbhajan just stood there and hit through the line. Bhajji has power and the
shot sailed over the long-on boundary at least ten rows back for a huge six. To add insult to injury,
Bhajji offered a wry smile to Steyn, who by now was furious.
Bhajji’s assault forced Graeme Smith to push his fielders back and so I walked up to Bhajji again to
say that he could stop trying to hit every ball now; he could just tap the ball and run. Our partnership
yielded 76 very valuable runs and when Bhajji was finally out for 40 with the score on 323 we were
within striking distance of the South African total. Eventually we managed a two-run lead.
Our bowlers started well in the South African second innings and Bhajji was again simply brilliant.
He snapped out the first four South African wickets with just 64 on the board and when Zaheer picked
up AB de Villiers with the score on 98, we started to believe a series win was possible. Ashwell Prince
got out with the score on 130 and we needed just one more wicket to get into the tail. Instead, Kallis
and Mark Boucher put together a match-saving partnership. Kallis played a superb innings despite
nursing a rib injury and his second hundred of the match took the game and also the series beyond us.
We were left to bat out the last day for a draw, which we did fairly comfortably.
Looking back, this was our best chance to win a series in South Africa. With half the side out for 98,
all we needed was one final burst to roll over the opposition, but instead we let South Africa off the

hook. Bhajji took seven wickets, but unfortunately the fast bowlers weren’t quite so successful at the
other end. In normal circumstances, a 1–1 series result in South Africa would be considered a really
good performance, but this was clearly a contest we should have won.

Weighty matters
The Test series was followed by a one-day series, which in effect would start our preparations for the
2011 World Cup. Annoyingly, I injured my hamstring right at the start of the series and was forced to
return to India. Before leaving, I asked every member of the squad to make a pledge. I told my teammates that with the World Cup in the subcontinent approaching, which was one of the most significant
competitions of our lives, it was important for everybody to sacrifice something ahead of the
tournament. My suggestion was to lose 3 kilos each and become a fitter side in the process.
I kept my promise and in fact lost 3.8 kilos. Some of my team-mates did so as well. To do this I had
to watch my diet and was on salads after returning to Mumbai. I underwent a rigorous rehabilitation
programme on my hamstring under the watchful eyes of Patrick Farhat, physio of the Mumbai
Indians, and also hit the gym regularly to strengthen my upper body. The World Cup was promising to
be the biggest tournament of my life. It was the one title that had eluded me and there was a good
chance it would be my last crack at becoming a world champion – and on home soil too.
